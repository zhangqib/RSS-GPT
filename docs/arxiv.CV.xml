Summary:
<br />
The paper introduces Multi-Cylindrical Panoramic Depth Estimation (MCPDepth), a novel framework for omnidirectional depth estimation that utilizes stereo matching on multiple cylindrical panoramas. Unlike existing methods, MCPDepth uses standard network components and a circular attention module to handle distortions in cylindrical panoramas, improving mean absolute error by 18.8% on Deep360 and 19.9% on 3D60 datasets. The paper provides a thorough analysis of spherical, cylindrical, and cubic projections, demonstrating the superiority of cylindrical projection. The approach offers practical insights for real-world applications and introduces a new paradigm in omnidirectional depth estimation. The code for MCPDepth is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Omnidirectional depth estimation presents a significant challenge due to the inherent distortions in panoramic images. Despite notable advancements, the impact of projection methods remains underexplored. We introduce Multi-Cylindrical Panoramic Depth Estimation (MCPDepth), a novel two-stage framework designed to enhance omnidirectional depth estimation through stereo matching across multiple cylindrical panoramas. MCPDepth initially performs stereo matching using cylindrical panoramas, followed by a robust fusion of the resulting depth maps from different views. Unlike existing methods that rely on customized kernels to address distortions, MCPDepth utilizes standard network components, facilitating seamless deployment on embedded devices while delivering exceptional performance. To effectively address vertical distortions in cylindrical panoramas, MCPDepth incorporates a circular attention module, significantly expanding the receptive field beyond traditional convolutions. We provide a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of common panoramic projections-spherical, cylindrical, and cubic-demonstrating the superior efficacy of cylindrical projection. Our method improves the mean absolute error (MAE) by 18.8% on the outdoor dataset Deep360 and by 19.9% on the real dataset 3D60. This work offers practical insights for other tasks and real-world applications, establishing a new paradigm in omnidirectional depth estimation.

Summary:  
ProstaTD is a new dataset for surgical triplet detection, addressing the lack of precise spatial bounding box annotations in existing datasets like CholecT50. It offers clinically defined temporal boundaries and high-precision bounding box annotations for each structured triplet activity, collected from 21 surgeries across multiple institutions. The annotation process involved multiple contributors, including practicing surgeons and medically trained annotators. Two labeling tools were developed to improve efficiency, along with an evaluation toolkit for standardized performance assessment. ProstaTD is the largest and most diverse surgical triplet dataset to date, providing a foundation for fair benchmarking in the field of surgical video analysis. <div>

Abstract: Surgical triplet detection is a critical task in surgical video analysis. However, existing datasets like CholecT50 lack precise spatial bounding box annotations, rendering triplet classification at the image level insufficient for practical applications. The inclusion of bounding box annotations is essential to make this task meaningful, as they provide the spatial context necessary for accurate analysis and improved model generalizability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce ProstaTD, a large-scale, multi-institutional dataset for surgical triplet detection, developed from the technically demanding domain of robot-assisted prostatectomy. ProstaTD offers clinically defined temporal boundaries and high-precision bounding box annotations for each structured triplet activity. The dataset comprises 71,775 video frames and 196,490 annotated triplet instances, collected from 21 surgeries performed across multiple institutions, reflecting a broad range of surgical practices and intraoperative conditions. The annotation process was conducted under rigorous medical supervision and involved more than 60 contributors, including practicing surgeons and medically trained annotators, through multiple iterative phases of labeling and verification. To further facilitate future general-purpose surgical annotation, we developed two tailored labeling tools to improve efficiency and scalability in our annotation workflows. In addition, we created a surgical triplet detection evaluation toolkit that enables standardized and reproducible performance assessment across studies. ProstaTD is the largest and most diverse surgical triplet dataset to date, moving the field from simple classification to full detection with precise spatial and temporal boundaries and thereby providing a robust foundation for fair benchmarking.

<div> diffusion models, multivariate subsurface modeling, probabilistic inversion, generative modeling, geological scenario

Summary:
Diffusion models are explored for multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion, showing enhanced capabilities compared to other generative models. By modifying the Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach, corrections are proposed to improve performance, including a likelihood approximation for noise-contaminated data. The method is tested in a geological scenario involving facies and acoustic impedance, demonstrating improved statistical robustness and reduced computational costs. Conditional modeling with both hard and indirect data is possible, with faster inversion compared to methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo. The approach offers enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function, making it a promising tool for multivariate subsurface modeling tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of these models in multimodal understanding and reasoning. However, the performance of MLLMs for knowledge-intensive visual questions, which require external knowledge beyond the visual content of an image, still remains limited. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution to provide models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and incorporates knowledge synthesis to refine its understanding. At each iteration, the model formulates a reasoning-guided multi-query to explore multiple facets of knowledge. Subsequently, these queries drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases, retrieving diverse knowledge. This retrieved knowledge is then synthesized to enrich the reasoning record, progressively deepening the model's understanding. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

<div> Multimodal reasoning, Vision-Language Models, autonomous driving, road topology, spatial reasoning <br />
Summary: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown progress in multimodal reasoning, but their application in autonomous driving's road topology understanding is limited. This study evaluates VLMs on road topology by projecting multi-view images into a unified ground-plane coordinate system to produce bird's-eye-view (BEV) lanes. Four topology-related diagnostic VQA tasks are formulated to assess spatial reasoning abilities. While closed-source models perform well in some tasks, they struggle with temporal questions. Open-source VLMs, even at large scales, face significant challenges in spatial reasoning, highlighting a fundamental bottleneck. Model performance is linked to size, token length, and example shots. These findings suggest the need for further research to improve VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning, yet their applications in autonomous driving remain limited. In particular, the ability to understand road topology, a key requirement for safe navigation, has received relatively little attention. While some recent works have begun to explore VLMs in driving contexts, their performance on topology reasoning is far from satisfactory. In this work, we systematically evaluate VLMs' capabilities in road topology understanding. Specifically, multi-view images are projected into unified ground-plane coordinate system and fused into bird's-eye-view (BEV) lanes. Based on these BEV lanes, we formulate four topology-related diagnostic VQA tasks, which together capture essential components of spatial topology reasoning. Through extensive evaluation, we find that while frontier closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve relatively high accuracy in some tasks, they still fail in some temporal questions that humans can answer (e.g., GPT-4o achieve only 67.8% in vector, a two-class classification problem). Furthermore, we find open-source VLMs, even at 30B scale, struggle significantly. These results indicate that spatial reasoning remains a fundamental bottleneck for current VLMs. We also find that the model's capability is positively correlated with model size, length of reasoning tokens and shots provided as examples, showing direction for future research.

Abstract: Open-set land-cover analysis in remote sensing requires the ability to achieve fine-grained spatial localization and semantically open categorization. This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery, segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2) semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free, the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation analysis.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach called Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap) for fusing cross-category objects in text-to-image generation. AGSwap consists of two key components: Group-wise Embedding Swapping and Adaptive Group Updating, which work together to produce more coherent and visually appealing results. Additionally, a new dataset called Cross-category Object Fusion (COF) is introduced, containing a large number of fusion pairs for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that AGSwap outperforms existing methods in compositional text-to-image generation tasks, including those using simple and complex prompts. This research addresses issues such as biased results, visual artifacts, and semantic inconsistencies that have been common in previous methods. <div>

Abstract: Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation due to its broad applications in virtual reality, digital media, film, and gaming. However, existing methods often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration. Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping, which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling 451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1 using simple and complex prompts.

Summary: 
This paper addresses the limitations of existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models by proposing a novel method called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA). The existing attacks show limitations in generalizability and undetectability, as they exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar targets and can be easily detected by anomaly detection methods. The PTA method leverages multiple proxies to optimize targeted adversarial examples, ensuring they align with multiple potential targets while remaining evasive to defenses. Theoretical analyses highlight the importance of balancing generalizability and undetectability to achieve optimal results. Experimental results demonstrate that the PTA method can achieve a high success rate across various related targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs) exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

Summary: 
This work addresses limitations in radiance fields by incorporating physically-based rendering through a framework using Gaussian surfels and spherical harmonics. The framework enables modeling of material reflective properties and lighting conditions, allowing for accurate global illumination effects. By extending classic radiosity theory, non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives are considered, with efficient solvers developed for light transport calculations. The backward pass for gradient optimizations is derived for improved efficiency. Inference achieves view-independent rendering, enabling rapid global illumination effects, such as view-dependent reflections. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior outcomes in geometry reconstruction, view synthesis, and relighting compared to existing methods, even with sparse datasets and varying lighting conditions. <div>
arXiv:2509.18497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives, propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known or unknown lighting conditions.

Summary: 
HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking) addresses the challenge of unmanned aerial vehicles navigating unknown environments and tracking targets in real-time. The framework combines traversal, acquisition, and tracking in a unified relative formulation. By defining navigation objectives from onboard observables like attitude and velocity, HUNT enables reactive high-speed flight during search missions. Once a target is detected, the system seamlessly transitions to tracking using a perception-control pipeline. Outdoor experiments in various scenarios including dense forests and search-and-rescue operations demonstrate the robust autonomy of HUNT where traditional global methods struggle. The framework's ability to adapt to degraded sensing conditions and lack of global localization makes it particularly effective for search and rescue missions using unmanned aerial vehicles. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search and rescue operations require unmanned aerial vehicles to both traverse unknown unstructured environments at high speed and track targets once detected. Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global localization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation have shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible detected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field of view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking. Outdoor experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue operations with vehicles and mannequins demonstrate robust autonomy where global methods fail.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

<div> Vision Language Models (VLMs), MATS, Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization, Spatial Consistency Score (SCS), Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR) <br />
Summary:
MATS is introduced as a behavioral audit to assess whether Vision Language Models (VLMs) reject visually contradicted statements. The audit measures Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR) to evaluate the performance of different models. Generative VLMs like LLaVA 1.5 and QwenVLchat exhibit low SCS and high IAR, indicating potential failures in real-world applications. Contrastive encoders such as CLIP and SigLIP are found to be more robust in rejecting visually contradicted statements. Activation patching helps localize failure areas, suggesting possible repair paths for both generative and contrastive models. The study highlights the importance of assessing model behavior beyond standard benchmarks to ensure trustworthiness in real-world scenarios.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS (Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR). Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust. Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

Summary: 
This paper presents a new algorithm for efficiently estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques are limited in addressing scale and rotation changes. The proposed algorithm integrates scale and rotation estimation using Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates and a cross-correlation maximization strategy. By incorporating sub-pixel-level cross-correlation, the algorithm achieves precise estimation of scale and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation compared to conventional Fourier transform-based techniques relying on discrete cross-correlation. The algorithm has implications for image registration in fields such as medical imaging and computer vision. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision. Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy, leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

<div> Keywords: Semi-supervised, Semantic segmentation, Computational pathology, Topology Graph Consistency, Graph-theoretic constraints

Summary:<br />
Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is crucial in computational pathology due to the high cost and limited availability of dense annotations. Current methods for SSSS often suffer from noisy pseudo-label propagation and produce fragmented or topologically incorrect masks. This paper introduces a new framework called Topology Graph Consistency (TGC) that incorporates graph-theoretic constraints to improve segmentation accuracy. By aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between prediction graphs and references, TGC enforces global topology in the segmentation process. Experimental results on datasets such as GlaS and CRAG show that TGC achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 5-10% supervision and significantly reduces the gap to full supervision. The code for TGC is also publicly available on GitHub, allowing for reproducibility and further research in this area.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data, posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes in the realm of unsupervised learning.

Summary:
Sequential Token Merging (STM) is proposed to enhance the efficiency of Vision Mambas (ViMs) by addressing the quadratic token scaling issue. The method leverages ViM's Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) and selective scan mechanism to reduce token redundancy. STM features bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve sequential dependencies and hidden states protection for stability. Experiments show that STM achieves superior results with minimal accuracy drop for ViM-Ti and ViM-S at significant token reductions. The method utilizes layer-wise loss convergence to enhance stability in the hidden states and provides new insights into state-space model dynamics. This approach offers state-of-the-art efficiency while maintaining minimal complexity. Codes for replication will be made available soon. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging (STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0% accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

<div> contrastive training, hyperspectral image, vision-language model, embeddings, scene understanding
Summary:
This article introduces a novel approach to optimizing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene understanding. By utilizing a CLIP-style contrastive training framework, the model aligns voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone with a large embedding model (LEM) through a trainable probe. The framework incorporates a contrastive loss function that focuses on curated sets of hard and semi-hard negatives, along with positive pairs, to enhance alignment between visual and textual modalities. Descriptive prompts are also used to encode class semantics and serve as structured anchors for the hyperspectral image embeddings. Surprisingly, despite updating only 0.07 percent of the total parameters, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, on datasets like Indian Pines and Pavia University, the model outperforms both unimodal and multimodal baselines in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa ($\kappa$) scores. Additionally, the model is significantly more parameter-efficient compared to existing approaches like DCTN and SS-TMNet. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI), the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives, along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07 percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa ($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters, nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot Federated Prompt Learning (FPL). This method aims to improve cross-task generalization in federated learning by restricting excessive interaction between original text embeddings and learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM includes an attention isolation module to suppress unwanted interactions and a collaborative refinement module to integrate decentralized visual knowledge for better global prompt calibration. Experimental results on ten benchmark datasets and two tasks demonstrate that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight existing methods in both class-level and domain-level generalization. This method enhances communication-efficient adaptation in federated learning and offers a practical solution for one-shot learning with improved cross-task generalization capabilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models. Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level and domain-level generalization.

This model integrates Mixture-of-Experts layers into the Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model, leveraging KPConv model features on seen classes for generating realistic fake features. Applied to the COVERED dataset for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) environments, the GZSL-MoE model demonstrates improved performance on both seen and unseen classes, making it a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments with limited training data. By combining the strengths of Generative Zero-Shot Learning and Mixture-of-Experts, the GZSL-MoE model enhances the semantic segmentation capabilities in 3D point clouds, particularly in scenarios where comprehensive data for all object classes is unavailable. <div>
arXiv:2509.22708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts (GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset (CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance performance on both seen and unseen classes.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation. These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT), are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the explainability Transformers.

<div> diffusion models, spatial layout, vision-language reasoning, scene generation, layout coherence  
Summary:  
LayoutAgent is a framework that combines vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for realistic multi-object scene generation. It preprocesses input images using visual-language models for segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. By leveraging compositional diffusion, LayoutAgent synthesizes bounding boxes based on object relations in the scene graph to generate spatial layouts. Finally, a foreground-conditioned image generator renders the objects into the planned layout guided by prompts. Experimental results show LayoutAgent outperforms existing models in layout coherence, spatial realism, and aesthetic alignment. <div>
arXiv:2509.22720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images, but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning, leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency, but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation. Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

The article introduces CompareBench, a benchmark designed to assess visual comparison reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). It comprises 1000 QA pairs across tasks like quantity, temporal, geometric, and spatial comparisons. The benchmark is derived from TallyBench and HistCaps datasets, evaluating both closed-source APIs and open-source models. Results indicate scalability but also highlight significant limitations in temporal ordering, spatial relations, counting, and geometric comparisons for even the strongest models tested. This suggests a systematic blind spot in VLMs for visual comparison tasks. By offering controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation, CompareBench sets a foundation for enhancing multimodal reasoning reliability. <div>

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity (600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation, CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal reasoning.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces MILR, a test-time method for image generation that combines reasoning over image and text in a unified latent vector space. MILR uses the policy gradient method guided by an image quality critic to perform joint reasoning. Implemented within the MUG framework, MILR supports language reasoning before image synthesis, facilitating cross-modal reasoning. MILR operates entirely at test time by optimizing intermediate model outputs in the unified latent space. Evaluations on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE benchmarks show state-of-the-art results, with an 80% improvement over baselines on WISE. The study highlights the effectiveness of joint reasoning in the unified latent space and demonstrates MILR's proficiency in temporal and cultural reasoning. <div>

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance in various domains, including image generation. However, existing reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space. Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

<div> Keywords: Breast cancer, thyroid cancer, ultrasound imaging, segmentation, UESA-Net

Summary: 
Breast and thyroid cancers are significant public health concerns, with ultrasound imaging being a cost-effective method for detection and segmentation. However, ultrasound images often suffer from noise and overlapping structures, making segmentation challenging. The UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional shrinkage attention, aims to bridge the gap between global context and local detail in ultrasound images. This network utilizes attention modules in multiple directions within encoding blocks to capture spatial details and integrate prior knowledge. The decoder part of the network applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism to enhance context modeling. Testing on public datasets TN3K and BUSI showed that UESA-Net outperformed existing methods with high intersection-over-union scores, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving robustness and accuracy in breast and thyroid ultrasound segmentation. The network effectively aggregates spatial information and prior knowledge to achieve superior segmentation performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) - UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper, we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new benchmarks for GCD.

Summary: 
DEFT introduces a novel Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning framework for efficiently fine-tuning pre-trained Text-to-Image models. The framework decomposes the update of the weight matrix into two components using trainable low-rank matrices, allowing for flexible parameter adaptation while minimizing computational resources. Extensive experiments on various datasets showcased state-of-the-art performance in personalization, object and scene adaptation, and universal image generation through visual in-context learning.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters. However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT, Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update. The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is available on \href{https://github.com/MAXNORM8650/DEFT}{DEFTBase}.

arXiv:2509.22799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality, semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168 human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc), while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for Best-of-N sampling.

Summary:<br />
State Space Models (SSMs) have shown promise as an alternative to Vision Transformers (ViTs) for vision tasks. The TRUST method proposed in this study aims to improve the generalization performance of SSMs under distribution shifts. By leveraging diverse traversal permutations to generate multiple perspectives of input images, TRUST uses model predictions as pseudo-labels for guiding updates of Mamba-specific parameters. The adapted weights are then averaged to integrate the learned information across traversal scans. Through experiments on seven benchmarks, TRUST consistently demonstrates enhanced robustness and outperforms existing test-time adaptation methods.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation. Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Summary: 
The paper introduces MMPB, a benchmark for evaluating Visual Language Models (VLMs) on personalization tasks. MMPB consists of 10k image-query pairs with 111 personalizable concepts across four categories. The benchmark is structured into three task types to evaluate different aspects of VLMs. Using 23 VLMs, the study found that most models struggle with personalization tasks, especially in maintaining consistency over dialogue and adapting to user preferences and visual cues. The analysis also revealed challenges such as refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting. The findings suggest significant room for improvement in VLMs for personalization. MMPB provides valuable insights and a foundation for future research in personalized multi-modal AI. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs. Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue, handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly personalized multi-modal AI.

<div> Framework, Adversarial patch attacks, Deep neural networks, Patch generation, Attack effectiveness

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework for generating fully controllable adversarial patches to attack deep neural networks. The framework allows attackers to choose both the input image and the target class, ensuring precise misclassification outcomes. By combining a generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, the method achieves high attack success rates and target-class success across various types of neural networks. It outperforms white-box attacks, untargeted baselines, and non-realistic approaches while maintaining visual realism and black-box applicability. The framework sets a new benchmark for adversarial robustness research by balancing attack strength, practical stealthiness, and targeted control. It bridges the gap between theoretical attack strength and real-world applicability, providing a comprehensive solution for defending against adversarial patch attacks in deep learning systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

CrossScaleNet introduces a novel architecture for time series forecasting that combines a patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve high performance and enhanced temporal explainability. The model embeds attention mechanisms into the training process, providing intrinsic explainability for temporal saliency and making decision-making transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive, but CrossScaleNet demonstrates robustness in identifying temporal saliency on synthetic and public datasets. The model outperforms most transformer-based models in forecasting accuracy while maintaining strong performance in temporal saliency detection. Existing models claiming explainability often lack performance on standard benchmarks, but CrossScaleNet offers a balanced approach that effectively captures temporal saliency and delivers state-of-the-art forecasting performance across datasets of varying complexity. <div>

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy. Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across datasets of varying complexity.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally. Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385. This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Summary:<br />
Deformable image registration (DIR) is crucial for medical image analysis, but traditional learning-based methods often struggle with precision. This study introduces KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into DIR using implicit neural representations (INRs). By implementing a randomized basis sampling strategy, the required number of basis functions in KAN is reduced, leading to lower computational costs without compromising registration quality. The proposed approach was evaluated on lung CT, brain MRI, and cardiac MRI datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to other INR-based methods across various modalities and anatomies. Notably, RandKAN-IDIR outperformed the model with learnable basis function indices while maintaining computational efficiency and learning stability across multiple random seeds. This work showcases the potential of using KANs in DIR with INRs for improved registration performance in medical image analysis. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.22874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers) offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI, cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

The Convolutional Set Transformer (CST) is a new neural architecture designed to process image sets with varying sizes and shared semantics. Unlike previous set-input networks, CST can handle 3D image tensors directly, eliminating the need for a separate feature extractor. This approach allows for improved performance in tasks like Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection. Additionally, CST is compatible with CNN explainability methods such as Grad-CAM. CSTs can be pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet and adapted to new domains through Transfer Learning. The CST-15 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, is available for further research.

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor, typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet (https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20 different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5 IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123 FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further confirms strong generalization capability. Additional results and resources are available at https://www.github.com/moured/TY-RIST

<br />
Summary: 
A well-designed vectorized representation is essential for 3D Gaussian Splatting in learning systems. While 3DGS enables efficient 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation is challenging to learn through neural networks. Directly using raw Gaussian parameters leads to data-dependent models due to non-unique and heterogeneous parameterization. To address this, an embedding representation based on continuous submanifold fields is proposed. This approach preserves color and geometric structure while ensuring unique mapping and channel homogeneity. By encapsulating intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, the representation enhances the learning of 3DGS in neural networks. <div>

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the learning of 3DGS.

<div> Keywords: Masked Diffusion Models, one-step generators, soft embeddings, GAN-based refinement, Test-Time Embedding Optimization

Summary:
Soft embeddings are introduced in this work to address limitations in one-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs). These generators suffer from biases inherited from the teacher and block gradient flow due to discrete token outputs. Soft embeddings provide a continuous surrogate that maintains representation fidelity while enabling end-to-end training and compatibility with various refinement techniques. The integration of soft embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (Soft-Di[M]O) allows for improved performance in class-to-image tasks, achieving a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement. Furthermore, Soft-Di[M]O enables higher GenEval and HPS scores in text-to-image synthesis through reward fine-tuning and benefits from Test-Time Embedding Optimization. Empirically, Soft-Di[M]O demonstrates state-of-the-art results in one-step generation tasks across multiple MDM teachers. 

<br /><br />Summary: Soft embeddings introduced in this work address limitations of one-step generators from MDMs, enabling end-to-end training and compatibility with various refinement techniques.

arXiv:2509.22925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training, reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution. Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen), Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement, along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

arXiv:2509.22930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0 model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0 achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58 percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI 2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new deep-learning framework for automatic brain tumor detection from MRI scans. Utilizing a pre-trained ResNet50 model and Global Average Pooling followed by linear projection, the framework extracts high-level image representations. A novel Dense-Dropout sequence is developed to enhance non-linear feature learning, reduce overfitting, and improve robustness. The creation of the Mymensingh Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, containing MRI scans from 209 subjects with clinically verified tumor and non-tumor images, addresses the lack of reliable brain tumor MRI resources.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS), and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209 subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep learning research.

Summary: 
Hemorica is a new publicly available dataset of 372 head CT scans annotated for five subtypes of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The dataset includes patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding boxes, pixel masks, and voxel masks. A rigorous double-reading workflow with neurosurgeon adjudication ensures low inter-rater variability. Statistical analysis confirms the dataset's clinical realism. Standard convolutional and transformer models, with minimal fine-tuning, achieved high accuracy for binary classification and lesion segmentation tasks. The lightweight MobileViT-XS model achieved an F1 score of 87.8% for classification, while a U-Net model with DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for segmentation. Hemorica serves as a benchmark for AI-based ICH detection systems, supporting multi-task learning and transfer to larger datasets with weaker labels. It represents a valuable resource for developing AI assistants for ICH diagnosis and quantification. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT) scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372 head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH), subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability. Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified, fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning, facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification systems.

<div> framework, AR model, view generation, camera trajectory, autoregressive transformer module

Summary:
The paper introduces ARSS, a novel framework for generating novel views from a single image based on a predefined camera trajectory. The framework leverages a GPT-style decoder-only AR model and a video tokenizer to map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens. A camera encoder is used to convert camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. To enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, an autoregressive transformer module is proposed, which randomly permutes the spatial order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets show that ARSS performs comparably to or better than state-of-the-art view synthesis approaches based on diffusion models. The code for ARSS will be released upon paper acceptance. <div>
arXiv:2509.23008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image, conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Summary: 
The study addresses the issue of static bias in action recognition models, which heavily rely on static cues over dynamic human motion, leading to subpar performance in real-world scenarios and zero-shot recognition. To combat this bias, the researchers propose a novel method that separates temporal dynamic information from static scene information. This approach involves incorporating a statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, along with a scene prediction loss. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of the method in reducing static bias and highlight the significance of the scene prediction loss component. The proposed approach holds promise for enhancing the performance of action recognition models by better capturing dynamic human motion cues.

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction loss.

Summary:
This study investigates the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) when dealing with corrupted point clouds due to scene complexity and sensor inaccuracies. By analyzing the sensitivity of DNNs to point cloud features using Shapley values, the study reveals that traditional models are highly reliant on certain features, making them susceptible to corruption. To address this issue, the proposed Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT) method aims to reduce the model's over-reliance on features by generating adversarial samples with desensitized features. Through a self-distillation framework, knowledge transfer is utilized to enhance the model's robustness without sacrificing performance on clean datasets. Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C datasets validate the effectiveness of DesenAT in improving the model's robustness against corrupted point clouds. The code for implementing DesenAT is publicly available for further exploration and research.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision, point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training' (DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes, generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model. Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/JerkyT/DesenAT/tree/master}{https://github.com/JerkyT/DesenAT}.

Summary: 
The article presents a novel approach for improving sign language translation from text to video by accurately modeling body poses and movements. The method incorporates geometric constraints on skeletal joints such as shoulders, arms, and hands, ensuring anatomically plausible outputs. During training, a parent-relative reweighting mechanism enhances finger flexibility and reduces motion stiffness, while bone-pose losses and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. The proposed method significantly narrows the performance gap between previous methods and ground-truth data, improving anatomical realism and motion naturalness. Discrepancies in bone length and movement variance are reduced by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, leading to more accurate and natural sign language translations. <div>

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Summary: With the rise of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), decision-making approaches have primarily relied on language-based reasoning, limiting their capabilities. A new direction with unified multimodal models (UMMs) has emerged to support both multimodal inputs and outputs, offering better reasoning through generated visual content. Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs, integrates policy, dynamics model, and value function into a single model. To improve dynamics predictions and avoid hallucinations, a self-discriminated filtering approach using a generative model is introduced. Experimental results on long-horizon planning tasks demonstrate Uni-Plan's superior success rates compared to VLM-based methods, showcasing strong data scalability without requiring expert demonstrations. This work sets a foundation for enhancing reasoning and decision-making with UMMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function. In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

Summary:
The article addresses concerns regarding copyright infringement by large vision models such as Stable Diffusion. It introduces the concept of detecting infringement from a Differential Privacy perspective, using the conditional sensitivity metric to quantify deviations in model outputs. The D-Plus-Minus (DPM) framework is proposed to identify copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models, simulating learning and unlearning processes. DPM computes confidence scores to disentangle concept-specific influence and global parameter shifts. The Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD) is constructed for standardized benchmarking. Results show that DPM effectively detects infringement content without requiring access to the original training data or text prompts. This offers an interpretable and practical solution for protecting intellectual property in the age of generative AI.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy (DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning. Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

Summary:<br />
Perceptual losses are effective for enhancing LDCT images compared to traditional pixel-wise losses. This study introduces the concept of perceptual influence to quantify the impact of perceptual loss design choices on model training. Experimental results show that carefully designed perceptual losses can significantly improve noise reduction and structural fidelity in reconstructed CT images without changing the network architecture. The study provides objective guidelines, supported by statistical analysis, for using perceptual losses in LDCT denoising. Better configurations for perceptual losses outperform widely used setups in the literature. The study's findings emphasize the importance of thoughtful design choices in optimizing perceptual losses for enhancing LDCT images.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization. In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario, outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1: 0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1: 0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability constraints.

<div> Regularization, Pose estimation, Neural networks, Geometric consistency, Regression accuracy
Summary: 
GeLoc3r is a novel approach to relative camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods by incorporating Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR). It overcomes the speed-accuracy trade-off by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses without requiring geometric computation during inference. By leveraging ground-truth depth information and a FusionTransformer to learn correspondence importance, GeLoc3r generates consistent poses via weighted RANSAC during training, transferring geometric knowledge into the regression network. This approach outperforms prior methods like ReLoc3R on challenging benchmarks like CO3Dv2, RealEstate10K, and MegaDepth1500, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining fast inference speed. GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry, combining the speed of regression with the geometric understanding of correspondence methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require 300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time, maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2 dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry, achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of correspondence methods.

<div> Keywords: rehabilitation therapy, stroke patients, remote monitoring systems, Human Action Recognition, deep learning<br />
Summary: <br />
Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage, prompting the emergence of remote monitoring systems using Human Action Recognition (HAR) technology. Existing HAR studies focus on non-disabled individuals, leading to the need for specialized systems for stroke patients. This study designed a system using IMU sensors and an RGB-D camera to monitor domiciliary upper limb Activities of Daily Living (ADL) for stroke patients. A deep learning model was proposed for processing multimodal data and analyzed for improved action recognition. The dataset collected showed differences in action data clustering between stroke patients and non-disabled individuals. The proposed model demonstrated potential for learning stroke patient action features and could be extended for feedback and assessment in domiciliary rehabilitation. The study's code is available for further research. <br />

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR) technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals. Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary rehabilitation in future research.

Summary:
- The paper introduces an activation-matching-based approach to generate minimal and faithful explanations for a pretrained classifier's decision-making process on an input image.
- A lightweight autoencoder is trained to produce a binary mask that preserves both the model's prediction and the intermediate activations of the image.
- The approach combines multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence and cross-entropy to align distributions and retain the top-1 label for both the image and its explanation.
- Mask priors such as L1 area, binarization penalty, and total variation are utilized for minimality, crispness, and compactness of the masks.
- Abductive constraints ensure faithfulness and necessity in the explanations, resulting in small, human-interpretable masks that accurately reflect the classifier's behavior while eliminating irrelevant input regions.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model \(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i) multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation; (ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp 0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small, human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution, existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas. This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1 percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision (BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios (e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces FMC-DETR, a novel framework for aerial-view object detection that addresses the challenge of detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial imagery. It utilizes the Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which enhances global low-frequency context perception and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for adaptive non-linear modeling. The framework also includes a Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module for improved multi-scale feature interaction and a Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module for balancing detail preservation and global enhancement. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FMC-DETR outperforms existing methods with fewer parameters, achieving significant improvements in tiny object detection. The code for FMC-DETR is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2509.23056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies. Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial, frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its effectiveness in tiny object detection.

Summary:<br />
This paper explores image inpainting with a focus on preference alignment. The authors utilize direct preference optimization and public reward models to create preference training datasets. Through experiments on nine reward models and two benchmarks, they find that most reward models offer valid scores for constructing preference data. However, biases in reward models, such as in brightness and color scheme, can lead to reward hacking. Combining an ensemble of models mitigates these biases and improves alignment model performance significantly. The authors demonstrate superior results compared to previous models across various metrics and evaluations. The study provides a solid baseline for future research in this area. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2) Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models, particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/shenytzzz/Follow-Your-Preference.

Summary:
XMAG is a lightweight foundation model developed through cross-magnification distillation for computational pathology. It transfers knowledge from a high-magnification teacher to an efficient low-magnification student architecture, achieving diagnostic accuracy comparable to larger models with a 30-fold processing speed increase. The model operates entirely at 5x magnification, requiring fewer image patches per whole slide image and demonstrating robust generalization across multiple cancer types. XMAG's dual-level knowledge transfer aligns global image representations and local spatial token mapping, enabling real-time pathology AI integration in resource-constrained clinical environments. The model was trained on millions of images and validated for clinical deployment, showcasing its potential for accelerating histopathology analysis tasks in real-world settings. End-to-end training strategies further boost XMAG's performance to approach larger foundation models, making cross-magnification distillation a viable approach for efficient and effective pathology AI solutions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

Summary:
CoPatch is introduced as a zero-shot referring image segmentation (RIS) framework that enhances spatial representations in both text and image modalities. By incorporating context tokens carrying spatial cues in language and extracting patch-level image features using a novel path from intermediate layers in vision, CoPatch improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS tasks. This approach significantly boosts performance across datasets like RefCOCO and RefCOCO+ without the need for additional training. The method overcomes limitations in current vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, which struggle with understanding spatial relationships. By leveraging untapped spatial knowledge inherent in VLMs, CoPatch demonstrates the potential for enhancing spatial awareness in zero-shot RIS applications. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens. Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language, \textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+ 2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in zero-shot RIS.

Summary:
HTMA-Net is a new framework aimed at reducing the cost of multiplications in deep neural networks for energy-constrained edge devices. By integrating the Hadamard Transform with multiplication-avoiding SRAM-based in-memory computing, HTMA-Net selectively replaces convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. The framework was evaluated on ResNet-18 using different datasets and compared against regular, MF-only, and HT-only models. Results indicated that HTMA-Net could eliminate up to 52% of multiplications compared to baseline models while achieving comparable accuracy. Additionally, the approach significantly reduced computational complexity and the number of parameters in the models. The findings suggest that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory computing multiplication-avoiding operators holds promise for developing efficient deep learning architectures.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations. We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards efficient deep learning architectures.

<title>Towards Comprehensive Interactive Change Understanding in Remote Sensing: A Large-scale Dataset and Dual-granularity Enhanced VLM</title>

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment. However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning, thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric, which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost. Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization. Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Abstract: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke diagnosis but is limited by low image contrast and signal to noise ratio. We address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformer, to generate powerful feature representations for a comprehensive set of stroke analysis tasks. Our evaluation encompasses infarct and hemorrhage segmentation, anomaly classification (normal vs. stroke and normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH, SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear analysis of both the advantages and current constraints of the approach. The code is available at https://github.com/Zzz0251/DINOv3-stroke.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent. Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

<title>WeatherCycle: Unpaired Multi-Weather Restoration via Color Space Decoupled Cycle Learning</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle, guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core, WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module} (LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation, enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)} module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to complex weather degradations.

<title>Sparse2Dense: A Keypoint-driven Generative Framework for Human Video Compression and Vertex Prediction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures. Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications. As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end, video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside infrastructure.

<title>Confidence-Calibrating Regularization for Robust Brain MRI Segmentation Under Domain Shift</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23176</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a $+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a $-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing SAM's encoder.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations. In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the target system.

Abstract: Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) is a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for studying speech articulation, motor control, and related disorders. However, real-time tongue contour segmentation remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, imaging variability, and computational demands. We propose UltraUNet, a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture optimized for real-time segmentation of tongue contours in ultrasound images. UltraUNet incorporates domain-specific innovations such as lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks, Group Normalization for small-batch stability, and summation-based skip connections to reduce memory and computational overhead. It achieves 250 frames per second and integrates ultrasound-specific augmentations like denoising and blur simulation. Evaluations on 8 datasets demonstrate high accuracy and robustness, with single-dataset Dice = 0.855 and MSD = 0.993px, and cross-dataset Dice averaging 0.734 and 0.761. UltraUNet provides a fast, accurate solution for speech research, clinical diagnostics, and analysis of speech motor disorders.

<title>Patch Rebirth: Toward Fast and Transferable Model Inversion of Vision Transformers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer, along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect, thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge. Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

<title>Self-Consistency as a Free Lunch: Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models via Self-Reflection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses, which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER, MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods. Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper published in IEEE Sensors Conference 2024. The final published version is available at 10.1109/SENSORS60989.2024.10785056.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare, manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40 subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all 27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our "propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the 3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss. Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture, relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large (Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against misuse of I2V generation models.

<title>Seeing Through the Blur: Unlocking Defocus Maps for Deepfake Detection</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/irissun9602/Defocus-Deepfake-Detection

<title>Seeing the Unseen in Low-light Spike Streams</title>

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution, shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras, spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work, we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval (ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of Diff-SPK.

<title>Balanced Diffusion-Guided Fusion for Multimodal Remote Sensing Classification</title>

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However, pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at https://github.com/HaoLiu-XDU/BDGF.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

<title>C3-OWD: A Curriculum Cross-modal Contrastive Learning Framework for Open-World Detection</title>

arXiv:2509.23316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$ AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$ mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness and diversity evaluations.

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network (BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution (S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can attain a promising performance.

<title>Decoupling Reasoning and Perception: An LLM-LMM Framework for Faithful Visual Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning, strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial improvement in reasoning fidelity.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10 benchmark.

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network, increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis. DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of 110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36 diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946 patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12 senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios, including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

<title>Dynamic-TreeRPO: Breaking the Independent Trajectory Bottleneck with Structured Sampling</title>

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

<title>Test-time Uncertainty Estimation for Medical Image Registration via Transformation Equivariance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23355</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution. Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining, existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level. However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation, where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600), length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10.

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions, and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output. Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model, enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details, effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets. Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and distillation strategy.

<title>UniPose: Unified Cross-modality Pose Prior Propagation towards RGB-D data for Weakly Supervised 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>

arXiv:2509.23376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data). UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations. This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods. Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos; however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS). Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities. To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis, traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model, termed Fracture-YOLO, which integrates novel Critical-Region-Selector Attention (CRSelector) and Scale-Aware (ScA) heads to further enhance detection performance. Specifically, the CRSelector module utilizes global texture information to focus on critical features of fracture regions. Meanwhile, the ScA module dynamically adjusts the weights of features at different scales, enhancing the model's capacity to identify fracture targets at multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model, Fracture-YOLO achieves a significant improvement in detection precision, with mAP50 and mAP50-95 increasing by 4 and 3, surpassing the baseline model and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC). Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with FracDetNet achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0\%, reflecting a \textbf{7.5\%} improvement over the baseline model. Furthermore, the mAP$_{50}$ reaches 63.9\%, representing an increase of \textbf{4.2\%}, with fracture-specific detection accuracy also enhanced by \textbf{2.9\%}.

<title>SPIKE-RL: Video-LLMs meet Bayesian Surprise</title>

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable, surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream, identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs. SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can revise their understanding in response to new information.

<title>FM-SIREN &amp; FM-FINER: Nyquist-Informed Frequency Multiplier for Implicit Neural Representation with Periodic Activation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23438</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23438</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR) networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

<title>FoR-SALE: Frame of Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23452</link>

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image (T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE), an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% using only a single round of correction.

<title>3DPCNet: Pose Canonicalization for Robust Viewpoint-Invariant 3D Kinematic Analysis from Monocular RGB cameras</title>

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact, estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism. From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses, guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

<title>No Concept Left Behind: Test-Time Optimization for Compositional Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts. This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time optimization and the base T2I model.

<title>Robust Multi-Modal Face Anti-Spoofing with Domain Adaptation: Tackling Missing Modalities, Noisy Pseudo-Labels, and Model Degradation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23475</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation (DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

<title>RestoRect: Degraded Image Restoration via Latent Rectified Flow &amp; Feature Distillation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23480</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose 'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection. RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

<title>Orientation-anchored Hyper-Gaussian for 4D Reconstruction from Casual Videos</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23492</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos. While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex, region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time, space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition, and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision, question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark design and evaluation.

<title>Enhancing Polyp Segmentation via Encoder Attention and Dynamic Kernel Update</title>

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module, iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three, and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-, three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking a significant advancement in the literature.

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable, well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters, 5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced hallucinations. While LR-trained video models serve as strong general-purpose baselines, our adaptive framework represents the state-of-the-art solution for safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

<title>OVSeg3R: Learn Open-vocabulary Instance Segmentation from 2D via 3D Reconstruction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23541</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm, which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision, stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of +2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled, rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals: photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual environments.

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head, body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches. We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing, leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed, heterogeneous datasets.

<title>Towards Interpretable Visual Decoding with Attention to Brain Representations</title>

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output. In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations, bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of visual neuroscience.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

<title>VividFace: High-Quality and Efficient One-Step Diffusion For Video Face Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance. Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency, we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering practical resources for the research community.

<title>Multi-Level Heterogeneous Knowledge Transfer Network on Forward Scattering Center Model for Limited Samples SAR ATR</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23596</link>

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization. Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations. First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning. A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration quality and
  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration. Our code is available

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy, specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and fine-grained visual distinctions.

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced generative models in medical imaging.

arXiv:2509.23605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation, where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising, inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic consistency, and human-rated creativity.

<title>FlowLUT: Efficient Image Enhancement via Differentiable LUTs and Iterative Flow Matching</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example, although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images. Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

<title>InteractMove: Text-Controlled Human-Object Interaction Generation in 3D Scenes with Movable Objects</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly. To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1) scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution. We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object. Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring, blood flow modeling, and progression prediction.

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation (TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled. We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training, where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and remask them. This alternating ($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$) process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

arXiv:2509.23626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks, existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models; a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$ smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization, which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens. Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a \textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

<title>LightFair: Towards an Efficient Alternative for Fair T2I Diffusion via Debiasing Pre-trained Text Encoders</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23639</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

arXiv:2509.23640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset, EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of 0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than conventional selection strategies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception, the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception. Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models. Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency, resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme, supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches. Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker. The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through abrupt pose changes.

<title>ReWatch-R1: Boosting Complex Video Reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models through Agentic Data Synthesis</title>

arXiv:2509.23652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT. A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification. Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&amp;R) reward mechanism that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: We present LLaVA-OneVision-1.5, a novel family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that achieve state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational and financial costs. Different from the existing works, LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 provides an open, efficient, and reproducible framework for building high-quality vision-language models entirely from scratch. The LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 release comprises three primary components: (1) Large-Scale Curated Datasets: We construct an 85M concept-balanced pretraining dataset LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Traning and a meticulously curated 26M instruction dataset LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Instruct, collectively encompassing 64B compressed multimodal tokens. (2) Efficient Training Framework: We develop a complete end-to-end efficient training framework leveraging an offline parallel data packing strategy to facilitate the training of LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 within a $16,000 budget. (3) State-of-the-art Performance: Experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-OneVision1.5 yields exceptionally competitive performance across a broad range of downstream tasks. Specifically, LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-8B outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on 18 of 27 benchmarks, and LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-4B surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-3B on all 27 benchmarks. We anticipate releasing LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-RL shortly and encourage the community to await further updates.

<title>HIVTP: A Training-Free Method to Improve VLMs Efficiency via Hierarchical Visual Token Pruning Using Middle-Layer-Based Importance Score</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance. Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the 1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks. Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher inference efficiency.

<title>Token Merging via Spatiotemporal Information Mining for Surgical Video Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23672</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However, current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM) method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically, the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner, STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

arXiv:2509.23673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues. Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction, hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases, indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers & practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases, enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

<title>MSD-KMamba: Bidirectional Spatial-Aware Multi-Modal 3D Brain Segmentation via Multi-scale Self-Distilled Fusion Strategy</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23677</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23677</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba, which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.

<title>QuantSparse: Comprehensively Compressing Video Diffusion Transformer with Model Quantization and Attention Sparsification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23681</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment. Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains, but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity. Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88 PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$} reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end inference. Our code will be released in https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantSparse.

<title>HomeSafeBench: A Benchmark for Embodied Vision-Language Models in Free-Exploration Home Safety Inspection</title>

arXiv:2509.23690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards: fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room, HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs. The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable reference and support for future research related to home security inspections. Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

<title>Confidence Aware SSD Ensemble with Weighted Boxes Fusion for Weapon Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced, they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion (WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy. Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving accuracy metrics of ensembles.

<title>INSTINCT: Instance-Level Interaction Architecture for Query-Based Collaborative Perception</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT (INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

arXiv:2509.23708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit, which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme -- enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions, enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and insertion stages.

<title>PD-Diag-Net: Clinical-Priors guided Network on Brain MRI for Auxiliary Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease</title>

arXiv:2509.23719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1) Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior), which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than 20%.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then, since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output. Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long) dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon acceptance.

<title>M3DLayout: A Multi-Source Dataset of 3D Indoor Layouts and Structured Descriptions for 3D Generation</title>

arXiv:2509.23728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation. M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

<title>LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Abstract: In this paper we propose FastViDAR, a novel framework that takes four fisheye camera inputs and produces a full $360^\circ$ depth map along with per-camera depth, fusion depth, and confidence estimates. Our main contributions are: (1) We introduce Alternative Hierarchical Attention (AHA) mechanism that efficiently fuses features across views through separate intra-frame and inter-frame windowed self-attention, achieving cross-view feature mixing with reduced overhead. (2) We propose a novel ERP fusion approach that projects multi-view depth estimates to a shared equirectangular coordinate system to obtain the final fusion depth. (3) We generate ERP image-depth pairs using HM3D and 2D3D-S datasets for comprehensive evaluation, demonstrating competitive zero-shot performance on real datasets while achieving up to 20 FPS on NVIDIA Orin NX embedded hardware.

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer (ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1) multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details. Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a 27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space. Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps, apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

<title>ResAD++: Towards Class Agnostic Anomaly Detection via Residual Feature Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD), where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features. In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at https://github.com/xcyao00/ResAD.

<title>Poivre: Self-Refining Visual Pointing with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre). This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training, we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset, and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks, and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction, dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851 and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions. The source code of our network is available at https://github.com/ayousefinejad/PVTAdpNet.git

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception. These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

<title>GenView++: Unifying Adaptive View Generation and Quality-Driven Supervision for Contrastive Representation Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally. To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned, and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2 by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and +5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text retrieval R@5 by +3.2%.

<title>A Modality-Tailored Graph Modeling Framework for Urban Region Representation via Contrastive Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23772</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1) They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element, remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

<title>Texture Vector-Quantization and Reconstruction Aware Prediction for Generative Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration, result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&amp;RAP) is able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

arXiv:2509.23781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs) excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's parameters.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming. Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven planning and design.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic 4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM, the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1) Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation, incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes, occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2 (MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved 39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However, existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover, current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate 3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward function to optimize generative models. The project is available at https://cbysjtu.github.io/Rank2Score/.

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast, conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores. Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen concepts.

<title>FairViT-GAN: A Hybrid Vision Transformer with Adversarial Debiasing for Fair and Explainable Facial Beauty Prediction</title>

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details. Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust, transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI systems for subjective visual assessment.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2) internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

<title>Not All Tokens are Guided Equal: Improving Guidance in Visual Autoregressive Models</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

<title>Learning Adaptive Pseudo-Label Selection for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes. Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant SS3DOD methods.

<title>Tunable-Generalization Diffusion Powered by Self-Supervised Contextual Sub-Data for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23885</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23885</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time, self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising, SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing. Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

<title>AssemblyHands-X: Modeling 3D Hand-Body Coordination for Understanding Bimanual Human Activities</title>

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose) for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of bimanual activities.

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data; Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning; to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability. Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and helpful AI tools for doctors.

Abstract: The LifeCLEFs plant identification task provides a testbed for a system-oriented evaluation of plant identification about 500 species trees and herbaceous plants. Seven types of image content are considered: scan and scan-like pictures of leaf, and 6 kinds of detailed views with un- constrained conditions, directly photographed on the plant: flower, fruit, stem & bark, branch, leaf and entire view. The main originality of this data is that it was specifically built through a citizen sciences initiative conducted by Tela Botanica, a French social network of amateur and expert botanists. This makes the task closer to the conditions of a real- world application. This overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of task, summarizes the retrieval approaches employed by the participating groups, and provides an analysis of the main eval- uation results. With a total of ten groups from six countries and with a total of twenty seven submitted runs, involving distinct and original methods, this fourth year task confirms Image & Multimedia Retrieval community interest for biodiversity and botany, and highlights further challenging studies in plant identification.

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at 0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable, privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality. This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and subjective assessment. Our code are available at https://github.com/GGbond-study/FedDA.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier, centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift. Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity, domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of RL in this domain.

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text. Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also adhere to the textual guidance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising, its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis: a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models, without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions, enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However, directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1) Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes will be released.

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

<title>Learning Encoding-Decoding Direction Pairs to Unveil Concepts of Influence in Deep Vision Networks</title>

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients. Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions. A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder, or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data, decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images. However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT), providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships. (3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11 representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

<title>AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy</title>

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop, demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/AutoPrune.

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage. Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/DragosChileban/CrashSplat.

Abstract: We present HunyuanImage 3.0, a native multimodal model that unifies multimodal understanding and generation within an autoregressive framework, with its image generation module publicly available. The achievement of HunyuanImage 3.0 relies on several key components, including meticulous data curation, advanced architecture design, a native Chain-of-Thoughts schema, progressive model pre-training, aggressive model post-training, and an efficient infrastructure that enables large-scale training and inference. With these advancements, we successfully trained a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model comprising over 80 billion parameters in total, with 13 billion parameters activated per token during inference, making it the largest and most powerful open-source image generative model to date. We conducted extensive experiments and the results of automatic and human evaluation of text-image alignment and visual quality demonstrate that HunyuanImage 3.0 rivals previous state-of-the-art models. By releasing the code and weights of HunyuanImage 3.0, we aim to enable the community to explore new ideas with a state-of-the-art foundation model, fostering a dynamic and vibrant multimodal ecosystem.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation (REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

<title>Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards for World Model Post-training</title>

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored. Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10% gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign) using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17% accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7 improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from 89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S (96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983), and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by +1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy 97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

<title>VFSI: Validity First Spatial Intelligence for Constraint-Guided Traffic Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation: current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to 8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation.

<title>Towards Redundancy Reduction in Diffusion Models for Efficient Video Super-Resolution</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23980</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23980</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings. This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at \href{https://github.com/jp-guo/OASIS}{https://github.com/jp-guo/OASIS}.

<title>RPG360: Robust 360 Depth Estimation with Perspective Foundation Models and Graph Optimization</title>

arXiv:2509.23991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360 images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion 0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the leaderboard at the time of submission.

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). However, its resource-intensive and invasive nature can expose patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records. TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage, particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary angiography.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the current gaze estimation methods within an HRI context of a shared workspace scenario. We introduce a new, annotated dataset collected with the NICO robotic platform. We evaluate four state-of-the-art gaze estimation models. The evaluation shows that the angular errors are close to those reported on general-purpose benchmarks. However, when expressed in terms of distance in the shared workspace the best median error is 16.48 cm quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging, as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a single consumer-grade GPU.

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies, processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in flexible and efficient video understanding.

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in hyperspectral settings.

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE / minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains. Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii) introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split, our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2% ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end learnable camera pipelines.

<title>Joint Superpixel and Self-Representation Learning for Scalable Hyperspectral Image Clustering</title>

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

<title>A Second-Order Perspective on Pruning at Initialization and Knowledge Transfer</title>

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However, their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment. Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

<title>Uncovering Grounding IDs: How External Cues Shape Multi-Modal Binding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24072</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures, such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together, our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and practical improvements in robustness.

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame, extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes. Among these designs, we find model video generation using \textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously. This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal human motion generation.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA) strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/lizhang1998/SVAC.

Abstract: The comparative study of generative models often requires significant computational resources, creating a barrier for researchers and practitioners. This paper introduces GANji, a lightweight framework for benchmarking foundational AI image generation techniques using a dataset of 10,314 Japanese Kanji characters. It systematically compares the performance of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). The results demonstrate that while the DDPM achieves the highest image fidelity, with a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score of 26.2, its sampling time is over 2,000 times slower than the other models. The GANji framework is an effective and accessible tool for revealing the fundamental trade-offs between model architecture, computational cost, and visual quality, making it ideal for both educational and research purposes.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$ and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10 \times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at $411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability, we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific regions, thereby fostering clinician trust and reliability in AI-assisted diagnostics.

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources, and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed and discussed in detail.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9 times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing one-step models. We will release code and models at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/FastVSR.

Abstract: The early and accurate classification of brain tumors is crucial for guiding effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. This study presents BrainFusion, a significant advancement in brain tumor analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by combining fine-tuned convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor classification--including VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception--with YOLOv8 for precise tumor localization with bounding boxes. Leveraging the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, our experiments reveal that the fine-tuned VGG16 model achieves test accuracy of 99.86%, substantially exceeding previous benchmarks. Beyond setting a new accuracy standard, the integration of bounding-box localization and explainable AI techniques further enhances both the clinical interpretability and trustworthiness of the system's outputs. Overall, this approach underscores the transformative potential of deep learning in delivering faster, more reliable diagnoses, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and survival rates.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment, reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets. Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states, overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Bian-jh/HoP-TM.

arXiv:2509.24181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification, assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value. DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

arXiv:2509.24182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal, manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12 weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models. Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the potential to help with precision medicine.

arXiv:2509.24192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects, attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole"). Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of linguistic compositionality.

<title>An Efficient 3D Latent Diffusion Model for T1-contrast Enhanced MRI Generation</title>

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients), meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets. Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test (N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM, Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/- 0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/- 0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps) than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges: maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total score compared to EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA, respectively, compared with the best prior 7B baselines.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice, fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8% (11.7M) of its parameters.

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods, however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static 3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module. An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at: https://zhenliuzju.github.io/huyingdong/Forge4D.

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on 17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++ achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties: dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology. External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858) and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models. In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation. Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second, action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained: reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code base and model weights will be released later.

<title>When MLLMs Meet Compression Distortion: A Coding Paradigm Tailored to MLLMs</title>

arXiv:2509.24258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images, videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS) and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance. Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs (CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an \textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing applications.

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints, enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation, counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

<title>Skeleton-based Robust Registration Framework for Corrupted 3D Point Clouds</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24273</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction. However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

<title>Robust Partial 3D Point Cloud Registration via Confidence Estimation under Global Context</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and 3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging conditions.

arXiv:2509.24288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training, we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals. Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and automated graphics generation.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis, and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh. OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over 904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24 synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets, advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field. Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this, we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions. Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential for intelligent agriculture.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG), and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG -- to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models, achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54 and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge, this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter scales.

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages. Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning, answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias. The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized. Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

<title>NeRV-Diffusion: Diffuse Implicit Neural Representations for Video Synthesis</title>

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode. 2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights. In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between frames or videos.

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information. To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets, demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves a balance between model performance and model complexity.

<title>DRIFT: Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations for Robust Adversarial Defense</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify \emph{gradient consensus}--the tendency of randomized transformations to yield aligned gradients--as a key driver of adversarial transferability. Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces \emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and (iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial defense.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

<title>Uni-X: Mitigating Modality Conflict with a Two-End-Separated Architecture for Unified Multimodal Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR) transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs, modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture. Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing, while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/CURRENTF/Uni-X

<title>Real-Aware Residual Model Merging for Deepfake Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset, R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly, R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

<title>From Satellite to Street: A Hybrid Framework Integrating Stable Diffusion and PanoGAN for Consistent Cross-View Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations, thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details, including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as clouds.

<title>DINOReg: Strong Point Cloud Registration with Vision Foundation Model</title>

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7% increase in registration recall.

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized - particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient, simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels, referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at https://github.com/chenhaocs/MCAE

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences, but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT, our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric (EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains, while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step orderings and filter out noise.

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings, even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in: https://github.com/Claud1234/PCICF

We achieve effective training of RapidMV by strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

<title>CLQ: Cross-Layer Guided Orthogonal-based Quantization for Diffusion Transformers</title>

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application. Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search. We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our code is available at \hyperlink{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}.

<title>A Data-Centric Perspective on the Influence of Image Data Quality in Machine Learning Models</title>

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development, with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset, we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training. Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in image-based machine learning.

<title>Proxy-GS: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting via Proxy Mesh</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering. To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles: first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training, avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset, Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

<title>Rethinking Unsupervised Cross-modal Flow Estimation: Learning from Decoupled Optimization and Consistency Constraint</title>

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V) generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However, existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the field.

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive 3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation, allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic, immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore benchmark.

<title>Beyond Isolated Facts: Synthesizing Narrative and Grounded Supervision for VideoQA</title>

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR (+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over 2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate, efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

<title>Generalist Multi-Class Anomaly Detection via Distillation to Two Heterogeneous Student Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24448</link>

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot, inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability. Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2. The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database. Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples before the selection.

<title>Mitigating Visual Hallucinations via Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization in MLLMs</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general vision-language benchmarks.

<title>Robust Multimodal Semantic Segmentation with Balanced Modality Contributions</title>

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation. To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities. Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality imbalance in segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and significantly outperforms existing models.

<title>CMT: Mid-Training for Efficient Learning of Consistency, Mean Flow, and Flow Map Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the (diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training) for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning. Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98% less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient, and general framework for training flow map models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions. However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable, and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport, interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting, Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks, systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DBFM-3E8E/.

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed to assess VideoLLMs' critical reasoning capabilities, including long-context recall and temporal grounding. To generate video question answering data for our task, we develop a scalable automated data generation pipeline that facilitates high-quality data synthesis. Built upon the proposed pipeline, we present NeMoBench, a video-language benchmark centered on our task. Specifically, our full set of NeMoBench features 31,378 automatically generated question-answer (QA) pairs from 13,486 videos with various durations ranging from seconds to hours. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline can reliably and automatically generate high-quality evaluation data, enabling NeMoBench to be continuously updated with the latest videos. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models on our benchmark, providing extensive results and key insights into their capabilities and limitations.

<title>TokenSwap: Backdoor Attack on the Compositional Understanding of Large Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24566</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However, the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones, making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM architectures.

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of 31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to 100\%.

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education, and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200 samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull, reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is available at https://github.com/wang-zidu/BFSM

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First, we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC) classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells. Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11, particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated, fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset (github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics, particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming, costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation. Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02% mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations, covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing. On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a critical gap in their role as generalists.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on specialized ones.

<title>RIFLE: Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation. Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement, RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally, Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation. For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments diffusion models with a register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative, scientific, and practical domains.

Abstract: This paper introduces Volterra Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (VNODE), a piecewise continuous Volterra Neural Network that integrates nonlinear Volterra filtering with continuous time neural ordinary differential equations for image classification. Drawing inspiration from the visual cortex, where discrete event processing is interleaved with continuous integration, VNODE alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE driven state evolution. This hybrid formulation captures complex patterns while requiring substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep architectures. VNODE consistently outperforms state of the art models with improved computational complexity as exemplified on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and Imagenet1K.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of existing methods, it is observed that the classification component significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658, and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing camouflaged object segmentation performance.

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size, number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

<title>SANA-Video: Efficient Video Generation with Block Linear Diffusion Transformer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration. SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets, which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it. Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising. Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

arXiv:2509.24709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113 meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles, and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets (e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models' ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their applications and to accelerate related research.

<title>Toward a Vision-Language Foundation Model for Medical Data: Multimodal Dataset and Benchmarks for Vietnamese PET/CT Report Generation</title>

arXiv:2509.24739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains, applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR), aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model, effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with \textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression. \textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas \textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at \href{https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS}{here}.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception, especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning, and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual, textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1 significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks, offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at: https://github.com/yizhuoDi/VTPerceprion-R1.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints. The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$ Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge. Code will be released at https://github.com/HRT00/CVGL-3D.

<title>LOVE-R1: Advancing Long Video Understanding with an Adaptive Zoom-in Mechanism via Multi-Step Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism, which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate, inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning. As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

<title>Vision Function Layer in Multimodal LLMs</title>

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition, narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers (VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities. Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset. This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

<title>Causal-Adapter: Taming Text-to-Image Diffusion for Faithful Counterfactual Generation</title>

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next, we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework, TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$ accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs, the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

<title>UP2You: Fast Reconstruction of Yourself from Unconstrained Photo Collections</title>

arXiv:2509.24817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5 minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task. Project Page: https://zcai0612.github.io/UP2You

<title>Training-Free Token Pruning via Zeroth-Order Gradient Estimation in Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24837</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations. Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end inference over the baseline.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components: (1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG solution.

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital, yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35, confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

arXiv:2509.24863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines, enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream vision models in safety-critical environments.

<title>StreamForest: Efficient Online Video Understanding with Persistent Event Memory</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024 tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness, efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video understanding.

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals: a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge, the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different mediums.

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study, we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day, Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2 features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined) attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives (e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine interpretability with representational power.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI, and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality control in dynamic medical settings.

arXiv:2509.24891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied, attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation pipelines.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU) show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and progression monitoring.

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for \textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models, our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers. Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks, with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench) and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

<title>Learning Goal-Oriented Language-Guided Navigation with Self-Improving Demonstrations at Scale</title>

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments, and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code: https://github.com/biomedia-mira/seg-cft.

arXiv:2509.24935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models: training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding. Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME, NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

<title>Evaluating Temperature Scaling Calibration Effectiveness for CNNs under Varying Noise Levels in Brain Tumour Detection</title>

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt & Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain settings.

arXiv:2509.24966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships. Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs, an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

<title>Event-based Facial Keypoint Alignment via Cross-Modal Fusion Attention and Self-Supervised Multi-Event Representation Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24968</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS 2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data, which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH), 0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This work ranked first in the BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1- Adult Glioma Segmentation.

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as hair strands. The released model is available on our website: \href{https://donghaotian123.github.io/Wan-Alpha/}{https://donghaotian123.github.io/Wan-Alpha/}.

<title>SDPose: Exploiting Diffusion Priors for Out-of-Domain and Robust Pose Estimation</title>

arXiv:2509.24980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization, their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD. Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field, they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents. To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories. Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass.

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content moderation

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning, change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models.

arXiv:2509.25027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work, we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues: contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting. Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

<title>VT-FSL: Bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.25033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data. Experiments on a custom traffic-control gesture dataset demonstrate high accuracy across varying viewing angles and speeds. Finally, an approach to calculate the speed of the arm signal (if necessary) is also presented.

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding. We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%.

<title>GEM: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and Accurate Cryo-EM Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to 48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction, unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision. Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image (D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth features. Code and models are available at https://dingning-liu.github.io/bridge.github.io/.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost. In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation -- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation, we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets, UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality.

<title>MANI-Pure: Magnitude-Adaptive Noise Injection for Adversarial Purification</title>

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1 robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians, enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines, which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training. Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs.

<title>Score Distillation of Flow Matching Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one- or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations. Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly available.

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit. However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice, where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images. TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain. We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of 2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address this challenge.

arXiv:2509.25146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and 440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation, semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform), across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments (indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors (resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at 25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

arXiv:2509.25151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning. We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism: visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers. Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at https://github.com/feufhd/VideoAnchor.

<title>GSM8K-V: Can Vision Language Models Solve Grade School Math Word Problems in Visual Contexts</title>

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text, enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception, planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently, numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation, we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement. GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and generalizable VLMs.

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second, we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU, with substantially reduced error accumulation.

<title>Aligning Visual Foundation Encoders to Tokenizers for Diffusion Models</title>

arXiv:2509.25162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of 1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

Abstract: This study presents Key Architectural Enhancements and Performance Benchmarking of Ultralytics YOLO26 for real-time edge object detection, providing a comprehensive overview of the design principles of YOLO26, technological advances, and deployment readiness. YOLO26, released in September 2025 by Ultralytics, represents the newest and most cutting-edge member of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) family, engineered to push the boundaries of efficiency and accuracy on edge and low-power devices. This paper highlights architectural innovations in YOLO26, including end-to-end NMS-free inference, removal of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) for streamlined exports, introduction of ProgLoss and Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL) for improved stability and small-object detection, and the adoption of the MuSGD optimizer inspired by large language model training. In addition, we report performance benchmarks for YOLO26 across edge devices, specifically NVIDIA Orin Jetson platforms, and compare results against YOLOv8 and YOLO11 (previous Ultralytics releases) as well as YOLOv12 and YOLOv13, which bridged the lineage between YOLO11 and YOLO26. Our comparative analysis highlights superior efficiency of YOLO26, accuracy, and deployment versatility, establishing it as a pivotal milestone in the YOLO evolution.

arXiv:2509.25172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i) surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and generation.

arXiv:2509.25177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations. To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

<title>GHOST: Hallucination-Inducing Image Generation for Multimodal LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

<title>DC-Gen: Post-Training Diffusion Acceleration with Deeply Compressed Latent Space</title>

arXiv:2509.25180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup. Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a 4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model.

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii) AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than their base counterparts without compromising quality, and further enable 2160x3840 video generation on a single GPU.

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation, large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized, object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model. This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D content creation.

<title>PixelCraft: A Multi-Agent System for High-Fidelity Visual Reasoning on Structured Images</title>

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning; however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism. Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

<title>FlashI2V: Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting Prevents Conditional Image Leakage in Image-to-Video Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25187</link>

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance. We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V, surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P.

<title>Visual Jigsaw Post-Training Improves MLLMs</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning. There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs. Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception, temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs.

<title>VGGT-X: When VGGT Meets Dense Novel View Synthesis</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

<title>YOLO-based Bearing Fault Diagnosis With Continuous Wavelet Transform</title>

Abstract: This letter proposes a YOLO-based framework for spatial bearing fault diagnosis using time-frequency spectrograms derived from continuous wavelet transform (CWT). One-dimensional vibration signals are first transformed into time-frequency spectrograms using Morlet wavelets to capture transient fault signatures. These spectrograms are then processed by YOLOv9, v10, and v11 models to classify fault types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets, including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU), and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), the proposed CWT-YOLO pipeline achieves significantly higher accuracy and generalizability than the baseline MCNN-LSTM model. Notably, YOLOv11 reaches mAP scores of 99.4% (CWRU), 97.8% (PU), and 99.5% (IMS). In addition, its region-aware detection mechanism enables direct visualization of fault locations in spectrograms, offering a practical solution for condition monitoring in rotating machinery.

Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) has been established as a high-accuracy 3D reconstruction method capable of achieving sub-pixel accuracy. However, this technique faces significant constraints due to complex calibration requirements, bulky system footprint, and sensitivity to environmental conditions. To address these limitations, we present VIRTUS-FPP, the first comprehensive physics-based virtual sensor modeling framework for FPP built in NVIDIA Isaac Sim. By leveraging the physics-based rendering and programmable sensing capabilities of simulation, our framework enables end-to-end modeling from calibration to reconstruction with full mathematical fidelity to the underlying principles of structured light. We conduct comprehensive virtual calibration and validate our system's reconstruction accuracy through quantitative comparison against ground truth geometry. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to model the virtual system as a digital twin by replicating a physical FPP system in simulation and validating correspondence between virtual and real-world measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that VIRTUS-FPP accurately models optical phenomena critical to FPP and achieves results comparable to real-world systems while offering unprecedented flexibility for system configuration, sensor prototyping, and environmental control. This framework significantly accelerates the development of real-world FPP systems by enabling rapid virtual prototyping before physical implementation.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires the generation of robust and long-horizon trajectory-level policy with conditions of perceptual observations and benefits from the advantages of SE(3)-equivariant diffusion models that are data-efficient. However, these models suffer from the inference time costs. Inspired by the inference efficiency of rectified flows, we introduce the rectification to the SE(3)-diffusion models and propose the ReSeFlow, i.e., Rectifying SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning Flows, providing fast, geodesic-consistent, least-computational policy generation. Crucially, both components employ SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and translational symmetry, enabling robust generalization under rigid-body motions. With the verification on the simulated benchmarks, we find that the proposed ReSeFlow with only one inference step can achieve better performance with lower geodesic distance than the baseline methods, achieving up to a 48.5% error reduction on the painting task and a 21.9% reduction on the rotating triangle task compared to the baseline's 100-step inference. This method takes advantages of both SE(3) equivariance and rectified flow and puts it forward for the real-world application of generative policy learning models with the data and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Cataract remains a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide, and early detection from retinal imaging is critical for timely intervention. We present a deep learning pipeline for cataract classification using the Ocular Disease Recognition dataset, containing left and right fundus photographs from 5000 patients. We evaluated CNNs, transformers, lightweight architectures, and knowledge-distilled models. The top-performing model, Swin-Base Transformer, achieved 98.58% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9836. A distilled MobileNetV3, trained with Swin-Base knowledge, reached 98.42% accuracy and a 0.9787 F1-score with greatly reduced computational cost. The proposed dual-eye Siamese variant of the distilled MobileNet, integrating information from both eyes, achieved an accuracy of 98.21%. Explainability analysis using Grad-CAM demonstrated that the CNNs concentrated on medically significant features, such as lens opacity and central blur. These results show that accurate, interpretable cataract detection is achievable even with lightweight models, supporting potential clinical integration in resource-limited settings

<title>Localizing Adversarial Attacks To Produces More Imperceptible Noise</title>

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&amp;W, to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative methods, such as PGD and C&amp;W, are more robust to localization constraints than single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and designing robust defensive systems.

<title>Achieving Fair Skin Lesion Detection through Skin Tone Normalization and Channel Pruning</title>

Abstract: Recent works have shown that deep learning based skin lesion image classification models trained on unbalanced dataset can exhibit bias toward protected demographic attributes such as race, age,and gender. Current bias mitigation methods usually either achieve high level of fairness with the degradation of accuracy, or only improve the model fairness on a single attribute. Additionally usually most bias mitigation strategies are either pre hoc through data processing or post hoc through fairness evaluation, instead of being integrated into the model learning itself. To solve these existing drawbacks, we propose a new Individual Typology Angle (ITA) Loss-based skin tone normalization and data augmentation method that directly feeds into an adaptable meta learning-based joint channel pruning framework. In skin tone normalization, ITA is used to estimate skin tone type and adjust automatically to target tones for dataset balancing. In the joint channel pruning framework, two nested optimization loops are used to find critical channels.The inner optimization loop finds and prunes the local critical channels by weighted soft nearest neighbor loss, and the outer optimization loop updates the weight of each attribute using group wise variance loss on meta-set. Experiments conducted in the ISIC2019 dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in simultaneously improving the fairness of the model on multiple sensitive attributes without significant degradation of accuracy. Finally, although the pruning mechanism adds some computational cost during training phase, usually training is done off line. More importantly,

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have been investigated in various domains due to their ability to generate high-quality data, thereby attracting significant attention. However, similar to traditional deep learning systems, there also exist potential threats to DMs. To provide advanced and comprehensive insights into safety, ethics, and trust in DMs, this survey comprehensively elucidates its framework, threats, and countermeasures. Each threat and its countermeasures are systematically examined and categorized to facilitate thorough analysis. Furthermore, we introduce specific examples of how DMs are used, what dangers they might bring, and ways to protect against these dangers. Finally, we discuss key lessons learned, highlight open challenges related to DM security, and outline prospective research directions in this critical field. This work aims to accelerate progress not only in the technical capabilities of generative artificial intelligence but also in the maturity and wisdom of its application.

Abstract: Diffusion models have found extensive use in solving numerous inverse problems. Such diffusion inverse problem solvers aim to sample from the posterior distribution of data given the measurements, using a combination of the unconditional score function and an approximation of the posterior related to the forward process. Recently, consistency models (CMs) have been proposed to directly predict the final output from any point on the diffusion ODE trajectory, enabling high-quality sampling in just a few NFEs. CMs have also been utilized for inverse problems, but existing CM-based solvers either require additional task-specific training or utilize data fidelity operations with slow convergence, not amenable to large-scale problems. In this work, we reinterpret CMs as proximal operators of a prior, enabling their integration into plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks. We propose a solver based on PnP-ADMM, which enables us to leverage the fast convergence of conjugate gradient method. We further accelerate this with noise injection and momentum, dubbed PnP-CM, and show it maintains the convergence properties of the baseline PnP-ADMM. We evaluate our approach on a variety of inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CM trained for MRI datasets. Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2 steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT), which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building general visual reasoning models.

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a highly active research domain that seeks to enable vehicles to perceive dynamic environments, predict the future trajectories of traffic agents such as vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists and plan safe and efficient future motions. To advance the field, several competitive platforms and benchmarks have been established to provide standardized datasets and evaluation protocols. Among these, leaderboards by the CARLA organization and nuPlan and the Waymo Open Dataset have become leading benchmarks for assessing motion planning algorithms. Each offers a unique dataset and challenging planning problems spanning a wide range of driving scenarios and conditions. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of the motion planning methods featured on these three leaderboards. To ensure a fair and unified evaluation, we adopt CARLA leaderboard v2.0 as our common evaluation platform and modify the selected models for compatibility. By highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches, we identify prevailing trends, common challenges, and suggest potential directions for advancing motion planning research.

Abstract: Sleep staging is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders and assessing neurological health. Existing automatic methods typically extract features from complex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, which often lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverages large multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnostic practices. Specifically, we convert raw one-dimensional PSG time-series into intuitive two-dimensional waveform images and then fine-tune a multimodal large model to learn from these representations. Experiments on three public datasets (ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) demonstrate that our approach enables general-purpose models, without prior exposure to sleep data, to acquire robust staging capabilities. Moreover, explanation analysis reveals our model learned to mimic the visual diagnostic workflow of human experts for sleep staging by PSG images. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its efficiency and practical value for medical applications. The code for the signal-to-image pipeline and the PSG image dataset will be released.

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on $\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and evaluating illustrations.

Our framework democratizes robotic data generation by producing massive visuomotor robotic demonstrations within minutes from a wide range of image sources, including camera captures, robotic datasets, and Internet images. At its core, our approach combines a novel method for single-view physical scene recovery with an efficient visual blending strategy for photorealistic data collection. We demonstrate RoLA's versatility across applications like scalable robotic data generation and augmentation, robot learning from Internet images, and single-image real-to-sim-to-real systems for manipulators and humanoids.

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual, accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: Data scarcity remains a fundamental challenge in robot learning. While human demonstrations benefit from abundant motion capture data and vast internet resources, robotic manipulation suffers from limited training examples. To bridge this gap between human and robot manipulation capabilities, we propose UniPrototype, a novel framework that enables effective knowledge transfer from human to robot domains via shared motion primitives. ur approach makes three key contributions: (1) We introduce a compositional prototype discovery mechanism with soft assignments, enabling multiple primitives to co-activate and thus capture blended and hierarchical skills; (2) We propose an adaptive prototype selection strategy that automatically adjusts the number of prototypes to match task complexity, ensuring scalable and efficient representation; (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in both simulation environments and real-world robotic systems. Our results show that UniPrototype successfully transfers human manipulation knowledge to robots, significantly improving learning efficiency and task performance compared to existing approaches.The code and dataset will be released upon acceptance at an anonymous repository.

<title>AttAnchor: Guiding Cross-Modal Token Alignment in VLMs with Attention Anchors</title>

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality. By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across 13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks. AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc with additional alignment losses.

<title>Leave No Observation Behind: Real-time Correction for VLA Action Chunks</title>

Abstract: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control.

<title>Training Vision-Language Process Reward Models for Test-Time Scaling in Multimodal Reasoning: Key Insights and Lessons Learned</title>

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.

<title>Robust Fine-Tuning from Non-Robust Pretrained Models: Mitigating Suboptimal Transfer With Adversarial Scheduling</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer. Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected robustness.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become the de facto standard for modeling the human visual system, primarily due to their success in predicting neural responses. However, with many models now achieving similar predictive accuracy, we need a stronger criterion. Here, we use small-scale adversarial probes to characterize the local representational geometry of many highly predictive ANN-based brain models. We report four key findings. First, we show that most contemporary ANN-based brain models are unexpectedly fragile. Despite high prediction scores, their response predictions are highly sensitive to small, imperceptible perturbations, revealing unreliable local coding directions. Second, we demonstrate that a model's sensitivity to adversarial probes can better discriminate between candidate neural encoding models than prediction accuracy alone. Third, we find that standard models rely on distinct local coding directions that do not transfer across model architectures. Finally, we show that adversarial probes from robustified models produce generalizable and semantically meaningful changes, suggesting that they capture the local coding dimensions of the visual system. Together, our work shows that local representational geometry provides a stronger criterion for brain model evaluation. We also provide empirical grounds for favoring robust models, whose more stable coding axes not only align better with neural selectivity but also generate concrete, testable predictions for future experiments.

Abstract: Simplified proxy models are commonly used to represent architectural structures, reducing storage requirements and enabling real-time rendering. However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task, particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency, while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail.

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical image analysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features. However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global, holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer, which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to 5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11% accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data. In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters (\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when evaluating claims of such generalization.

Abstract: Aerial outdoor semantic navigation requires robots to explore large, unstructured environments to locate target objects. Recent advances in semantic navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based, behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes. Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot in outdoor field tests.

Abstract: We introduce a method that automatically and jointly updates both continuous and discrete parameters of a compound lens design, to improve its performance in terms of sharpness, speed, or both. Previous methods for compound lens design use gradient-based optimization to update continuous parameters (e.g., curvature of individual lens elements) of a given lens topology, requiring extensive expert intervention to realize topology changes. By contrast, our method can additionally optimize discrete parameters such as number and type (e.g., singlet or doublet) of lens elements. Our method achieves this capability by combining gradient-based optimization with a tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, using transdimensional mutation and paraxial projection operations for efficient global exploration. We show experimentally on a variety of lens design tasks that our method effectively explores an expanded design space of compound lenses, producing better designs than previous methods and pushing the envelope of speed-sharpness tradeoffs achievable by automated lens design.

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA have transformed vision model adaptation, enabling the rapid deployment of customized models. However, the compactness of LoRA adaptations introduces new safety concerns, particularly their vulnerability to model extraction attacks. This paper introduces a new focus of model extraction attacks named LoRA extraction that extracts LoRA-adaptive models based on a public pre-trained model. We then propose a novel extraction method called StolenLoRA which trains a substitute model to extract the functionality of a LoRA-adapted model using synthetic data. StolenLoRA leverages a Large Language Model to craft effective prompts for data generation, and it incorporates a Disagreement-based Semi-supervised Learning (DSL) strategy to maximize information gain from limited queries. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of StolenLoRA, achieving up to a 96.60% attack success rate with only 10k queries, even in cross-backbone scenarios where the attacker and victim models utilize different pre-trained backbones. These findings reveal the specific vulnerability of LoRA-adapted models to this type of extraction and underscore the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms tailored to PEFT methods. We also explore a preliminary defense strategy based on diversified LoRA deployments, highlighting its potential to mitigate such attacks.

Abstract: In the field of 3D content generation, single image scene reconstruction methods still struggle to simultaneously ensure the quality of individual assets and the coherence of the overall scene in complex environments, while texture editing techniques often fail to maintain both local continuity and multi-view consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene, which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background. Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely align with text prompts.

<title>Efficient Audio-Visual Speech Separation with Discrete Lip Semantics and Multi-Scale Global-Local Attention</title>

Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation (AVSS) methods leverage visual cues to extract target speech and have demonstrated strong separation quality in noisy acoustic environments. However, these methods usually involve a large number of parameters and require high computational cost, which is unacceptable in many applications where speech separation serves as only a preprocessing step for further speech processing. To address this issue, we propose an efficient AVSS method, named Dolphin. For visual feature extraction, we develop DP-LipCoder, a dual-path lightweight video encoder that transforms lip-motion into discrete audio-aligned semantic tokens. For audio separation, we construct a lightweight encoder-decoder separator, in which each layer incorporates a global-local attention (GLA) block to efficiently capture multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that Dolphin not only surpassed the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in separation quality but also achieved remarkable improvements in efficiency: over 50% fewer parameters, more than 2.4x reduction in MACs, and over 6x faster GPU inference speed. These results indicate that Dolphin offers a practical and deployable solution for high-performance AVSS in real-world scenarios. Our code and demo page are publicly available at http://cslikai.cn/Dolphin/.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained Vision-Language-Models (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

<title>DFG-PCN: Point Cloud Completion with Degree-Flexible Point Graph</title>

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a vital task focused on reconstructing complete point clouds and addressing the incompleteness caused by occlusion and limited sensor resolution. Traditional methods relying on fixed local region partitioning, such as k-nearest neighbors, which fail to account for the highly uneven distribution of geometric complexity across different regions of a shape. This limitation leads to inefficient representation and suboptimal reconstruction, especially in areas with fine-grained details or structural discontinuities. This paper proposes a point cloud completion framework called Degree-Flexible Point Graph Completion Network (DFG-PCN). It adaptively assigns node degrees using a detail-aware metric that combines feature variation and curvature, focusing on structurally important regions. We further introduce a geometry-aware graph integration module that uses Manhattan distance for edge aggregation and detail-guided fusion of local and global features to enhance representation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

<title>StrucADT: Generating Structure-controlled 3D Point Clouds with Adjacency Diffusion Transformer</title>

Abstract: In the field of 3D point cloud generation, numerous 3D generative models have demonstrated the ability to generate diverse and realistic 3D shapes. However, the majority of these approaches struggle to generate controllable 3D point cloud shapes that meet user-specific requirements, hindering the large-scale application of 3D point cloud generation. To address the challenge of lacking control in 3D point cloud generation, we are the first to propose controlling the generation of point clouds by shape structures that comprise part existences and part adjacency relationships. We manually annotate the adjacency relationships between the segmented parts of point cloud shapes, thereby constructing a StructureGraph representation. Based on this StructureGraph representation, we introduce StrucADT, a novel structure-controllable point cloud generation model, which consists of StructureGraphNet module to extract structure-aware latent features, cCNF Prior module to learn the distribution of the latent features controlled by the part adjacency, and Diffusion Transformer module conditioned on the latent features and part adjacency to generate structure-consistent point cloud shapes. Experimental results demonstrate that our structure-controllable 3D point cloud generation method produces high-quality and diverse point cloud shapes, enabling the generation of controllable point clouds based on user-specified shape structures and achieving state-of-the-art performance in controllable point cloud generation on the ShapeNet dataset.

Abstract: The task of 3D shape captioning occupies a significant place within the domain of computer graphics and has garnered considerable interest in recent years. Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the utilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet often fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods.

<title>GBSK: Skeleton Clustering via Granular-ball Computing and Multi-Sampling for Large-Scale Data</title>

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data. This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and trustworthy.

<title>Accuracy-Robustness Trade Off via Spiking Neural Network Gradient Sparsity Trail</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23762</link>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving adversarial robustness in SNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, remains a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but increase vulnerability to attacks.

Abstract: Controlling illumination during video post-production is a crucial yet elusive goal in computational photography. Existing methods often lack flexibility, restricting users to certain relighting models. This paper introduces ReLumix, a novel framework that decouples the relighting algorithm from temporal synthesis, thereby enabling any image relighting technique to be seamlessly applied to video. Our approach reformulates video relighting into a simple yet effective two-stage process: (1) an artist relights a single reference frame using any preferred image-based technique (e.g., Diffusion Models, physics-based renderers); and (2) a fine-tuned stable video diffusion (SVD) model seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the sequence. To ensure temporal coherence and prevent artifacts, we introduce a gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending and a temporal bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors. Although trained on synthetic data, ReLumix shows competitive generalization to real-world videos. The method demonstrates significant improvements in visual fidelity, offering a scalable and versatile solution for dynamic lighting control.

<title>FedAgentBench: Towards Automating Real-world Federated Medical Image Analysis with Server-Client LLM Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals), (b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6 modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy, Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium, and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3 can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for even the strongest models.

Abstract: Whisper speech recognition is crucial not only for ensuring privacy in sensitive communications but also for providing a critical communication bridge for patients under vocal restraint and enabling discrete interaction in noise-sensitive environments. The development of Chinese mandarin audio-visual whisper speech recognition is hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets. We present AISHELL6-Whisper, a large-scale open-source audio-visual whisper speech dataset, featuring 30 hours each of whisper speech and parallel normal speech, with synchronized frontal facial videos. Moreover, we propose an audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) baseline based on the Whisper-Flamingo framework, which integrates a parallel training strategy to align embeddings across speech types, and employs a projection layer to adapt to whisper speech's spectral properties. The model achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 4.13% for whisper speech and 1.11% for normal speech in the test set of our dataset, and establishes new state-of-the-art results on the wTIMIT benchmark. The dataset and the AVSR baseline codes are open-sourced at https://zutm.github.io/AISHELL6-Whisper.

<title>Efficient Multi-turn RL for GUI Agents via Decoupled Training and Adaptive Data Curation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23866</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner. DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput, and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1) pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

<title>Taught Well Learned Ill: Towards Distillation-conditional Backdoor Attack</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a vital technique for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices by transferring knowledge from large teacher models to lightweight student models. While teacher models from third-party platforms may undergo security verification (\eg, backdoor detection), we uncover a novel and critical threat: distillation-conditional backdoor attacks (DCBAs). DCBA injects dormant and undetectable backdoors into teacher models, which become activated in student models via the KD process, even with clean distillation datasets. While the direct extension of existing methods is ineffective for DCBA, we implement this attack by formulating it as a bilevel optimization problem and proposing a simple yet effective method (\ie, SCAR). Specifically, the inner optimization simulates the KD process by optimizing a surrogate student model, while the outer optimization leverages outputs from this surrogate to optimize the teacher model for implanting the conditional backdoor. Our SCAR addresses this complex optimization utilizing an implicit differentiation algorithm with a pre-optimized trigger injection function. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model architectures, and KD techniques validate the effectiveness of our SCAR and its resistance against existing backdoor detection, highlighting a significant yet previously overlooked vulnerability in the KD process. Our code is available at https://github.com/WhitolfChen/SCAR.

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the information additional to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).

Abstract: This case study details The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)'s partnership with Zauron Labs, Inc. to enhance detection and coding of aortic calcifications (ACs) using chest radiographs. ACs are often underreported despite their significant prognostic value for cardiovascular disease, and UTMB partnered with Zauron to apply its advanced AI tools, including a high-performing image model (AUC = 0.938) and a fine-tuned language model based on Meta's Llama 3.2, to retrospectively analyze imaging and report data. The effort identified 495 patients out of 3,988 unique patients assessed (5,000 total exams) whose reports contained indications of aortic calcifications that were not properly coded for reimbursement (12.4% miscode rate) as well as an additional 84 patients who had aortic calcifications that were missed during initial review (2.1% misdiagnosis rate). Identification of these patients provided UTMB with the potential to impact clinical care for these patients and pursue $314k in missed annual revenue. These findings informed UTMB's decision to adopt Zauron's Guardian Pro software system-wide to ensure accurate, AI-enhanced peer review and coding, improving both patient care and financial solvency. This study is covered under University of Texas Health San Antonio's Institutional Review Board Study ID 00001887.

<title>SLA: Beyond Sparsity in Diffusion Transformers via Fine-Tunable Sparse-Linear Attention</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24006</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation, attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N) attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality, outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.

Abstract: The human auditory cortex is topographically organized. Neurons with similar response properties are spatially clustered, forming smooth maps for acoustic features such as frequency in early auditory areas, and modular regions selective for music and speech in higher-order cortex. Yet, evaluations for current computational models of auditory perception do not measure whether such topographic structure is present in a candidate model. Here, we show that cortical topography is not present in the previous best-performing models at predicting human auditory fMRI responses. To encourage the emergence of topographic organization, we adapt a cortical wiring-constraint loss originally designed for visual perception. The new class of topographic auditory models, TopoAudio, are trained to classify speech, and environmental sounds from cochleagram inputs, with an added constraint that nearby units on a 2D cortical sheet develop similar tuning. Despite these additional constraints, TopoAudio achieves high accuracy on benchmark tasks comparable to the unconstrained non-topographic baseline models. Further, TopoAudio predicts the fMRI responses in the brain as well as standard models, but unlike standard models, TopoAudio develops smooth, topographic maps for tonotopy and amplitude modulation (common properties of early auditory representation, as well as clustered response modules for music and speech (higher-order selectivity observed in the human auditory cortex). TopoAudio is the first end-to-end biologically grounded auditory model to exhibit emergent topography, and our results emphasize that a wiring-length constraint can serve as a general-purpose regularization tool to achieve biologically aligned representations.

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000 time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions (median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection, and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks, at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving ${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU memory size, speed, and accuracy.

Abstract: Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects: picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time. These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object state manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used representations of 3D data, but determining the visibility of points from a given viewpoint remains a challenging problem due to their sparse nature and lack of explicit connectivity. Traditional methods, such as Hidden Point Removal (HPR), face limitations in computational efficiency, robustness to noise, and handling concave regions or low-density point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visibility determination in point clouds by formulating it as a binary classification task. The core of our network consists of a 3D U-Net that extracts view-independent point-wise features and a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that predicts point visibility using the extracted features and view direction as inputs. The network is trained end-to-end with ground-truth visibility labels generated from rendered 3D models. Our method significantly outperforms HPR in both accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving up to 126 times speedup on large point clouds. Additionally, our network demonstrates robustness to noise and varying point cloud densities and generalizes well to unseen shapes. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on the ShapeNet, ABC Dataset and real-world datasets, showing substantial improvements in visibility accuracy. We also demonstrate the versatility of our method in various applications, including point cloud visualization, surface reconstruction, normal estimation, shadow rendering, and viewpoint optimization. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/octree-nn/neural-visibility.

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men and the eighth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become central to the diagnostic pathway for men at intermediate risk, improving de-tection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) while reducing unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis. However, mpMRI remains limited by false positives, false negatives, and moderate to substantial interobserver agreement. Time-dependent diffusion (TDD) MRI, a novel sequence that enables tissue microstructure characterization, has shown encouraging preclinical performance in distinguishing clinically significant from insignificant PCa. Combining TDD-derived metrics with machine learning may provide robust, zone-specific risk prediction with less dependence on reader training and improved accuracy compared to current standard-of-care. This study protocol out-lines the rationale and describes the prospective evaluation of a home-developed AI-enhanced TDD-MRI software (PROSTDAI) in routine diagnostic care, assessing its added value against PI-RADS v2.1 and validating results against MRI-guided prostate biopsy.

Abstract: Real-time dense scene reconstruction during unstable camera motions is crucial for robotics, yet current RGB-D SLAM systems fail when cameras experience large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Classical optimization-based methods deliver high accuracy but fail with poor initialization during large motions, while learning-based approaches provide robustness but lack sufficient accuracy for dense reconstruction. We address this challenge through a combination of learning-based initialization with optimization-based refinement. Our method employs a camera pose regression network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames, which serve as reliable starting points for a randomized optimization algorithm that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate promising results: our approach outperforms the best competitor on challenging benchmarks, while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion sequences. The system operates in real-time, showcasing that combining simple and principled techniques can achieve both robustness for unstable motions and accuracy for dense reconstruction.

<title>Rethinking JEPA: Compute-Efficient Video SSL with Frozen Teachers</title>

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT (Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student), increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically, our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video representation learning.

Abstract: Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction is challenged by slow per-frame optimization, inconsistent motion estimation, and unsustainable storage demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Reconfigurable Continuum Gaussian Stream, dubbed ReCon-GS, a novel storage-aware framework that enables high fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time rendering. Specifically, we dynamically allocate multi-level Anchor Gaussians in a density-adaptive fashion to capture inter-frame geometric deformations, thereby decomposing scene motion into compact coarse-to-fine representations. Then, we design a dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration strategy that preserves localized motion expressiveness through on-demand anchor re-hierarchization, while ensuring temporal consistency through intra-hierarchical deformation inheritance that confines transformation priors to their respective hierarchy levels. Furthermore, we introduce a storage-aware optimization mechanism that flexibly adjusts the density of Anchor Gaussians at different hierarchy levels, enabling a controllable trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and memory usage. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by approximately 15% and achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced robustness and stability. Moreover, at equivalent rendering quality, ReCon-GS slashes memory requirements by over 50% compared to leading state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We introduce a psychologically grounded and artist-informed framework for modeling visual creativity across four domains: Inner, Outer, Imaginative, and Moral Worlds. Drawing on interviews with practicing artists and theories from psychology, we define 12 traits that capture affective, symbolic, cultural, and ethical dimensions of creativity.Using 20k artworks from the SemArt dataset, we annotate images with GPT 4.1 using detailed, theory-aligned prompts, and evaluate the learnability of these traits from CLIP image embeddings. Traits such as Environmental Dialogicity and Redemptive Arc are predicted with high reliability ($R^2 \approx 0.64 - 0.68$), while others like Memory Imprint remain challenging, highlighting the limits of purely visual encoding. Beyond technical metrics, we visualize a "creativity trait-space" and illustrate how it can support interpretable, trait-aware co-creation - e.g., sliding along a Redemptive Arc axis to explore works of adversity and renewal. By linking cultural-aesthetic insights with computational modeling, our work aims not to reduce creativity to numbers, but to offer shared language and interpretable tools for artists, researchers, and AI systems to collaborate meaningfully.

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential indicator of global climate change and one of the most intuitive factors reflecting ocean conditions. Obtaining high-resolution SST data remains challenging due to limitations in physical imaging, and super-resolution via deep neural networks is a promising solution. Recently, Mamba-based approaches leveraging State Space Models (SSM) have demonstrated significant potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, their application to SST data super-resolution remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the Wavelet-assisted Mamba Super-Resolution (WMSR) framework for satellite-derived SST data. The WMSR includes two key components: the Low-Frequency State Space Module (LFSSM) and High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM). The LFSSM uses 2D-SSM to capture global information of the input data, and the robust global modeling capabilities of SSM are exploited to preserve the critical temperature information in the low-frequency component. The HFEM employs the pixel difference convolution to match and correct the high-frequency feature, achieving accurate and clear textures. Through comprehensive experiments on three SST datasets, our WMSR demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/oucailab/WMSR.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant traction in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence for their potential in energy-efficient computing. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) excel at gradient-based optimization and high accuracy. This contrast has consequently led to a growing subfield of hybrid ANN-SNN research. However, existing hybrid approaches often rely on either a strict separation between ANN and SNN components or employ SNN-only encoders followed by ANN classifiers due to the constraints of non-differentiability of spike encoding functions, causing prior hybrid architectures to lack deep layer-wise cooperation during backpropagation. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN framework that integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within conventional ANN pipelines. Central to our method is the use of surrogate gradients for a bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end differentiable training across ANN and SNN layers. This design achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while retaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of spiking computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a surrogate gradient for bit plane coding specifically and spike encoder interface in general to be utilized in the context of hybrid ANN-SNN, successfully leading to a new class of hybrid models that pave new directions for future research.

Abstract: Early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is crucial as it allows for timely intervention, preventing vision loss and enabling effective management of diabetic complications. This research performs detection of DR and DME at an early stage through the proposed framework which includes three stages: preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In the preprocessing stage, noise filtering is performed by fuzzy filtering, artefact removal is performed by non-linear diffusion filtering, and the contrast improvement is performed by a novel filter called Adaptive Variable Distance Speckle (AVDS) filter. The AVDS filter employs four distance calculation methods such as Euclidean, Bhattacharya, Manhattan, and Hamming. The filter adaptively chooses a distance method which produces the highest contrast value amongst all 3 methods. From the analysis, hamming distance method was found to achieve better results for contrast and Euclidean distance showing less error value with high PSNR. The segmentation stage is performed using Improved Mask-Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask RCNN). In the final stage, feature extraction and classification using novel Self-Spatial Attention infused VGG-16 (SSA-VGG-16), which effectively captures both global contextual relationships and critical spatial regions within retinal images, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of DR and DME detection and grading. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using two distinct datasets: IDRiD and MESSIDOR.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable, estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone. SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including challenging scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that identifies recurring patterns -- referred to as ``music-words'' -- from symbolic music data. These patterns are fundamental to musical structure and reflect the cognitive processes involved in composition. However, extracting these patterns remains challenging because of the inherent semantic ambiguity in musical interpretation. We formulate the task of music-word discovery as a statistical optimization problem and propose a two-stage Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based learning framework: 1. Developing a music-word dictionary; 2. Reconstructing the music data. When evaluated against human expert annotations, the algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61. Our findings indicate that minimizing code length effectively addresses semantic ambiguity, suggesting that human optimization of encoding systems shapes musical semantics. This approach enables computers to extract ``basic building blocks'' from music data, facilitating structural analysis and sparse encoding. The method has two primary applications. First, in AI music, it supports downstream tasks such as music generation, classification, style transfer, and improvisation. Second, in musicology, it provides a tool for analyzing compositional patterns and offers insights into the principle of minimal encoding across diverse musical styles and composers.

Abstract: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis refers to adaptively generating and optimizing grasps for various robotic hands with different morphologies. This capability is crucial for achieving versatile robotic manipulation in diverse environments and requires substantial amounts of reliable and diverse grasp data for effective model training and robust generalization. However, existing approaches either rely on physics-based optimization that lacks human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection processes that are limited to anthropomorphic structures. In this paper, we propose CEDex, a novel cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method at scale that bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics by aligning robot kinematic models with generated human-like contact representations. Given an object's point cloud and an arbitrary robotic hand model, CEDex first generates human-like contact representations using a Conditional Variational Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data. It then performs kinematic human contact alignment through topological merging to consolidate multiple human hand parts into unified robot components, followed by a signed distance field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints. Using CEDex, we construct the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset to date, comprising 500K objects across four gripper types with 20M total grasps. Extensive experiments show that CEDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and our dataset benefits cross-embodiment grasp learning with high-quality diverse grasps.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales. Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound (V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified generative models.

Abstract: We propose a high-payload image watermarking method for textual embedding, where a semantic description of the image - which may also correspond to the input text prompt-, is embedded inside the image. In order to be able to robustly embed high payloads in large-scale images - such as those produced by modern AI generators - the proposed approach builds upon a traditional watermarking scheme that exploits orthogonal and turbo codes for improved robustness, and integrates frequency-domain embedding and perceptual masking techniques to enhance watermark imperceptibility. Experiments show that the proposed method is extremely robust against a wide variety of image processing, and the embedded text can be retrieved also after traditional and AI inpainting, permitting to unveil the semantic modification the image has undergone via image-text mismatch analysis.

Abstract: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything communication has shown great promise in enhancing situational awareness for autonomous vehicles and other mobile robotic platforms. Despite recent advances in perception backbones and multi-agent fusion, real-world deployments remain challenged by hard detection cases, exemplified by partial detections and noise accumulation which limit downstream detection accuracy. This work presents Diffusion on Reinforced Cooperative Perception (DRCP), a real-time deployable framework designed to address aforementioned issues in dynamic driving environments. DRCP integrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent, a cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and adaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2) Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement module that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns bird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed system achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly improving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in late 2025.

Abstract: In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on image-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context, primitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios by compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations. Towards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be structure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware alignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel superquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes structure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to iteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap between primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by structure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to drive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on SDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In addition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement to preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce 3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both reconstruction quality and primitive-level editability.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples, such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters ($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion process

<title>Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning for Wildfire Danger Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger; however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

Abstract: As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural language instructions remains a central challenge. Progress in robust mobile manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states, six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469 episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of Vision-Language-Action models. The first version of our dataset is now available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/airoa-org/airoa-moma .

Abstract: Interactive editing of character images with diffusion models remains challenging due to the inherent trade-off between fine-grained control, generation speed, and visual fidelity. We introduce CharGen, a character-focused editor that combines attribute-specific Concept Sliders, trained to isolate and manipulate attributes such as facial feature size, expression, and decoration with the StreamDiffusion sampling pipeline for more interactive performance. To counteract the loss of detail that often accompanies accelerated sampling, we propose a lightweight Repair Step that reinstates fine textures without compromising structural consistency. Throughout extensive ablation studies and in comparison to open-source InstructPix2Pix and closed-source Google Gemini, and a comprehensive user study, CharGen achieves two-to-four-fold faster edit turnaround with precise editing control and identity-consistent results.

<title>Unsupervised Representation Learning for 3D Mesh Parameterization with Semantic and Visibility Objectives</title>

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover, existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria: (1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic- and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i) segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion (AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines. Our implementation code is publicly available at: https://github.com/AHHHZ975/Semantic-Visibility-UV-Param.

arXiv:2509.25131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions. For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences, producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient, end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised long-horizon speech generation.

Abstract: Designers craft and edit graphic designs in a layer representation, but layer-based editing becomes impossible once composited into a raster image. In this work, we propose LayerD, a method to decompose raster graphic designs into layers for re-editable creative workflow. LayerD addresses the decomposition task by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers. We propose a simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty. In experiments, we show that LayerD successfully achieves high-quality decomposition and outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate the use of LayerD with state-of-the-art image generators and layer-based editing.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.

Abstract: Inferring the unseen attribute-object composition is critical to make machines learn to decompose and compose complex concepts like people. Most existing methods are limited to the composition recognition of single-attribute-object, and can hardly learn relations between the attributes and objects. In this paper, we propose an attribute-object semantic association graph model to learn the complex relations and enable knowledge transfer between primitives. With nodes representing attributes and objects, the graph can be constructed flexibly, which realizes both single- and multi-attribute-object composition recognition. In order to reduce mis-classifications of similar compositions (e.g., scratched screen and broken screen), driven by the contrastive loss, the anchor image feature is pulled closer to the corresponding label feature and pushed away from other negative label features. Specifically, a novel balance loss is proposed to alleviate the domain bias, where a model prefers to predict seen compositions. In addition, we build a large-scale MultiAttribute Dataset (MAD) with 116,099 images and 8,030 label categories for inferring unseen multi-attribute-object compositions. Along with MAD, we propose two novel metrics Hard and Soft to give a comprehensive evaluation in the multi-attribute setting. Experiments on MAD and two other single-attribute-object benchmarks (MIT-States and UT-Zappos50K) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been widely used in large-scale Vision and Language Pre-training (VLP) models. Though previous VLP works have proved the effectiveness of ViTs, they still suffer from computational efficiency brought by the long visual sequence. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient vision-and-language pre-training model with \textbf{T}ext-\textbf{R}elevant \textbf{I}mage \textbf{P}atch \textbf{S}election, namely TRIPS, which reduces the visual sequence progressively with a text-guided patch-selection layer in the visual backbone for efficient training and inference. The patch-selection layer can dynamically compute text-dependent visual attention to identify the attentive image tokens with text guidance and fuse inattentive ones in an end-to-end manner. Meanwhile, TRIPS does not introduce extra parameters to ViTs. Experimental results on a variety of popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that TRIPS gain a speedup of 40\% over previous similar VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.

Abstract: Monocular visual odometry is a key technology in various autonomous systems. Traditional feature-based methods suffer from failures due to poor lighting, insufficient texture, and large motions. In contrast, recent learning-based dense SLAM methods exploit iterative dense bundle adjustment to address such failure cases, and achieve robust and accurate localization in a wide variety of real environments, without depending on domain-specific supervision. However, despite its potential, the methods still struggle with scenarios involving large motion and object dynamics. In this study, we diagnose key weaknesses in a popular learning-based dense SLAM model (DROID-SLAM) by analyzing major failure cases on outdoor benchmarks and exposing various shortcomings of its optimization process. We then propose the use of self-supervised priors leveraging a frozen large-scale pre-trained monocular depth estimator to initialize the dense bundle adjustment process, leading to robust visual odometry without the need to fine-tune the SLAM backbone. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method demonstrates significant improvements on KITTI odometry, as well as the challenging DDAD benchmark.

Abstract: We present fVDB, a novel GPU-optimized framework for deep learning on large-scale 3D data. fVDB provides a complete set of differentiable primitives to build deep learning architectures for common tasks in 3D learning such as convolution, pooling, attention, ray-tracing, meshing, etc.
  fVDB simultaneously provides a much larger feature set (primitives and operators) than established frameworks with no loss in efficiency: our operators match or exceed the performance of other frameworks with narrower scope. Furthermore, fVDB can process datasets with much larger footprint and spatial resolution than prior works, while providing a competitive memory footprint on small inputs. To achieve this combination of versatility and performance, fVDB relies on a single novel VDB index grid acceleration structure paired with several key innovations including GPU accelerated sparse grid construction, convolution using tensorcores, fast ray tracing kernels using a Hierarchical Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm (HDDA), and jagged tensors.
  Our framework is fully integrated with PyTorch enabling interoperability with existing pipelines, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on a number of representative tasks such as large-scale point-cloud segmentation, high resolution 3D generative modeling, unbounded scale Neural Radiance Fields, and large-scale point cloud reconstruction.

Abstract: Ground-to-aerial image synthesis focuses on generating realistic aerial images from corresponding ground street view images while maintaining consistent content layout, simulating a top-down view. The significant viewpoint difference leads to domain gaps between views, and dense urban scenes limit the visible range of street views, making this cross-view generation task particularly challenging. In this paper, we introduce SkyDiffusion, a novel cross-view generation method for synthesizing aerial images from street view images, utilizing a diffusion model and the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) paradigm. The Curved-BEV method in SkyDiffusion converts street-view images into a BEV perspective, effectively bridging the domain gap, and employs a "multi-to-one" mapping strategy to address occlusion issues in dense urban scenes. Next, SkyDiffusion designed a BEV-guided diffusion model to generate content-consistent and realistic aerial images. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, Ground2Aerial-3, designed for diverse ground-to-aerial image synthesis applications, including disaster scene aerial synthesis, low-altitude UAV image synthesis, and historical high-resolution satellite image synthesis tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SkyDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-view datasets across natural (CVUSA), suburban (CVACT), urban (VIGOR-Chicago), and various application scenarios (G2A-3), achieving realistic and content-consistent aerial image generation.

Abstract: This paper explains a neural network for image generation from a new perspective, i.e., explaining representation structures for image generation. We propose a set of desirable properties to define the representation structure of a neural network for image generation, including feature completeness, spatial boundedness and consistency. These properties enable us to propose a method for disentangling primitive feature components from the intermediate-layer features, where each feature component generates a primitive regional pattern covering multiple image patches. In this way, the generation of the entire image can be explained as a superposition of these feature components. We prove that these feature components, which satisfy the feature completeness property and the linear additivity property (derived from the feature completeness, spatial boundedness, and consistency properties), can be computed as OR Harsanyi interaction. Experiments have verified the faithfulness of the disentangled primitive regional patterns.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have introduced a new era of text-guided image manipulation, enabling users to create realistic edited images with simple textual prompts. However, there is significant concern about the potential misuse of these methods, especially in creating misleading or harmful content. Although recent defense strategies, which introduce imperceptible adversarial noise to induce model failure, have shown promise, they remain ineffective against more sophisticated manipulations, such as editing with a mask. In this work, we propose DiffusionGuard, a robust and effective defense method against unauthorized edits by diffusion-based image editing models, even in challenging setups. Through a detailed analysis of these models, we introduce a novel objective that generates adversarial noise targeting the early stage of the diffusion process. This approach significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of adversarial noises. We also introduce a mask-augmentation technique to enhance robustness against various masks during test time. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of methods in protecting against privacy threats in realistic scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves stronger protection and improved mask robustness with lower computational costs compared to the strongest baseline. Additionally, our method exhibits superior transferability and better resilience to noise removal techniques compared to all baseline methods. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/choi403/DiffusionGuard.

Abstract: We propose a novel Auto-Regressive (AR) image generation approach that models images as hierarchical compositions of interpretable visual layers. While AR models have achieved transformative success in language modeling, replicating this success in vision tasks has presented unique challenges due to inherent spatial dependencies in images. Addressing the unique challenges of vision tasks, our method (CART) adds image details iteratively via semantically meaningful decompositions. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of CART by applying it across three distinct decomposition strategies: (i) Base-Detail Decomposition (Mumford-Shah smoothness), (ii) Intrinsic Decomposition (albedo/shading), and (iii) Specularity Decomposition (diffuse/specular). This "next-detail" strategy outperforms traditional "next-token" and "next-scale" approaches, improving controllability, semantic interpretability, and resolution scalability. Experiments show CART generates visually compelling results while enabling structured image manipulation, opening new directions for controllable generative modeling via physically or perceptually motivated image factorization.

Abstract: Continuous visual autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated promising performance in image generation. However, the heavy autoregressive inference burden imposes significant overhead. In Large Language Models (LLMs), speculative decoding has effectively accelerated discrete autoregressive inference. However, the absence of an analogous theory for continuous distributions precludes its use in accelerating continuous AR models. To fill this gap, this work presents continuous speculative decoding, and addresses challenges from: 1) low acceptance rate, caused by inconsistent output distribution between target and draft models, and 2) modified distribution without analytic expression, caused by complex integral. To address challenge 1), we propose denoising trajectory alignment and token pre-filling strategies. To address challenge 2), we introduce acceptance-rejection sampling algorithm with an appropriate upper bound, thereby avoiding explicitly calculating the integral. Furthermore, our denoising trajectory alignment is also reused in acceptance-rejection sampling, effectively avoiding repetitive diffusion model inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed continuous speculative decoding achieves over $2\times$ speedup on off-the-shelf models, while maintaining the original generation quality.

These are computed from the viewpoints where they are observed by a novel CLIP merging method. Notably, our OVO has a significantly lower computational and memory footprint than offline baselines, while also showing better segmentation metrics than offline and online ones. Along with superior segmentation performance, we also show experimental results of our mapping contributions integrated with two different full SLAM backbones (Gaussian-SLAM and ORB-SLAM2), being the first ones using a neural network to merge CLIP descriptors and demonstrating end-to-end open-vocabulary online 3D mapping with loop closure.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used to enhance generalization in visual classification tasks. However, traditional methods struggle when source and target domains differ, as in domain adaptation, due to their inability to address domain gaps. This paper introduces GenMix, a generalizable prompt-guided generative data augmentation approach that enhances both in-domain and cross-domain image classification. Our technique leverages image editing to generate augmented images based on custom conditional prompts, designed specifically for each problem type. By blending portions of the input image with its edited generative counterpart and incorporating fractal patterns, our approach mitigates unrealistic images and label ambiguity, improving the performance and adversarial robustness of the resulting models. Efficacy of our method is established with extensive experiments on eight public datasets for general and fine-grained classification, in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Additionally, we demonstrate performance improvements for self-supervised learning, learning with data scarcity, and adversarial robustness. As compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods, our technique achieves stronger performance across the board.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image customization have enabled high-fidelity, context-rich generation of personalized images, allowing specific concepts to appear in a variety of scenarios. However, current methods struggle with combining multiple personalized models, often leading to attribute entanglement or requiring separate training to preserve concept distinctiveness. We present LoRACLR, a novel approach for multi-concept image generation that merges multiple LoRA models, each fine-tuned for a distinct concept, into a single, unified model without additional individual fine-tuning. LoRACLR uses a contrastive objective to align and merge the weight spaces of these models, ensuring compatibility while minimizing interference. By enforcing distinct yet cohesive representations for each concept, LoRACLR enables efficient, scalable model composition for high-quality, multi-concept image synthesis. Our results highlight the effectiveness of LoRACLR in accurately merging multiple concepts, advancing the capabilities of personalized image generation.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging of the medial elbow is crucial for the early diagnosis of Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL) injuries. Specifically, measuring the elbow joint space in ultrasound images is used to assess the valgus instability of the elbow caused by UCL injuries. To automate this measurement, a model trained on a precisely annotated dataset is necessary; however, no publicly available dataset exists to date. This study introduces a novel ultrasound medial elbow dataset to measure the joint space. The dataset comprises 4,201 medial elbow ultrasound images from 22 subjects, with landmark annotations on the humerus and ulna, based on the expertise of three orthopedic surgeons. We evaluated joint space measurement methods on our proposed dataset using heatmap-based, regression-based, and token-based landmark detection methods. While heatmap-based landmark detection methods generally achieve high accuracy, they sometimes produce multiple peaks on a heatmap, leading to incorrect detection. To mitigate this issue and enhance landmark localization, we propose Shape Subspace (SS) landmark refinement by measuring geometrical similarities between the detected and reference landmark positions. The results show that the mean joint space measurement error is 0.116 mm when using HRNet. Furthermore, SS landmark refinement can reduce the mean absolute error of landmark positions by 0.010 mm with HRNet and by 0.103 mm with ViTPose on average. These highlight the potential for high-precision, real-time diagnosis of UCL injuries by accurately measuring joint space. Lastly, we demonstrate point-based segmentation for the humerus and ulna using the detected landmarks as inputs. Our dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/Akahori000/Ultrasound-Medial-Elbow-Dataset

Abstract: Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.

Abstract: We present PERSE, a method for building a personalized 3D generative avatar from a reference portrait. Our avatar enables facial attribute editing in a continuous and disentangled latent space to control each facial attribute, while preserving the individual's identity. To achieve this, our method begins by synthesizing large-scale synthetic 2D video datasets, where each video contains consistent changes in facial expression and viewpoint, along with variations in a specific facial attribute from the original input. We propose a novel pipeline to produce high-quality, photorealistic 2D videos with facial attribute editing. Leveraging this synthetic attribute dataset, we present a personalized avatar creation method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, learning a continuous and disentangled latent space for intuitive facial attribute manipulation. To enforce smooth transitions in this latent space, we introduce a latent space regularization technique by using interpolated 2D faces as supervision. Compared to previous approaches, we demonstrate that PERSE generates high-quality avatars with interpolated attributes while preserving the identity of the reference individual.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods have become the state-of-the-art for reconstructing sub-sampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, studies have shown that these methods are susceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in major distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may lower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach for mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI reconstruction models without any retraining. Based on the idea of cyclic measurement consistency, we devise a novel mitigation objective that is minimized in a small ball around the attack input. Results show that our method substantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different datasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve retraining. We also introduce a practically relevant scenario for small adversarial perturbations that models impulse noise in raw data, which relates to \emph{herringbone artifacts}, and show the applicability of our approach in this setting. Finally, we show our mitigation approach remains effective in two \emph{realistic} extension scenarios: a blind setup, where the attack strength or algorithm is not known to the user; and an adaptive attack setup, where the attacker has full knowledge of the defense strategy.

Abstract: Feature extraction techniques are crucial in medical image classification; however, classical feature extractors, in addition to traditional machine learning classifiers, often exhibit significant limitations in providing sufficient discriminative information for complex image sets. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown promise in feature extraction, they are prone to overfitting due to the inherent characteristics of medical imaging data, including small sample sizes or high intra-class variance. In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture. This mechanism adjusts the token based on learned weights, improving the extraction of salient features and enhancing the model's adaptability to the challenges presented by medical imaging data. The MIAFEx output feature quality is compared against classical feature extractors using traditional and hybrid classifiers. Also, the performance of these features is compared against modern CNN and ViT models in classification tasks, demonstrating their superiority in accuracy and robustness across multiple complex medical imaging datasets. This advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios with limited training data, where traditional and modern models often struggle to generalize effectively.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable performance recently, and thus model hubs have emerged. Existing model hubs typically assume basic text matching is sufficient to search for models. However, in reality, due to different abstractions and the large number of models in model hubs, it is not easy for users to review model descriptions and example images, choosing which model best meets their needs. Therefore, it is necessary to describe model functionality wisely so that future users can efficiently search for the most suitable model for their needs. Efforts to address this issue remain limited. In this paper, we propose Conditional Generative Model Identification (CGI), which aims to provide an effective way to identify the most suitable model using user-provided example images rather than requiring users to manually review a large number of models with example images. To address this problem, we propose the PromptBased Model Identification (PMI) , which can adequately describe model functionality and precisely match requirements with specifications. To evaluate PMI approach and promote related research, we provide a benchmark comprising 65 models and 9100 identification tasks. Extensive experimental and human evaluation results demonstrate that PMI is effective. For instance, 92% of models are correctly identified with significantly better FID scores when four example images are provided.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D anatomical reconstruction is a prerequisite for downstream clinical tasks such as preoperative planning, radiotherapy target delineation, and orthopedic implant design. We present Med-PU, a knowledge-driven framework that integrates volumetric medical image segmentation with point cloud upsampling for accurate pelvic shape reconstruction. Unlike landmark- or PCA-based statistical shape models, Med-PU learns an implicit anatomical prior directly from large-scale 3D shape data, enabling dense completion and refinement from sparse segmentation-derived point sets. The pipeline couples SAM-Med3D-based voxel segmentation, point extraction, deep upsampling, and surface reconstruction, yielding smooth and topologically consistent meshes. We evaluate Med-PU on pelvic CT datasets (MedShapePelvic for training and Pelvic1k for validation), benchmarking against state-of-the-art upsampling methods using comprehensive geometry and surface metrics. Med-PU consistently improves surface quality and anatomical fidelity while reducing artifacts, demonstrating robustness across input densities. Although validated on the pelvis, the approach is anatomy-agnostic and applicable to other skeletal regions and organs. These results suggest Med-PU as a practical, generalizable tool to bridge segmentation outputs and clinically usable 3D models.

Abstract: Functional data, representing curves or trajectories, are ubiquitous in fields like biomedicine and motion analysis. A fundamental challenge is phase variability -- temporal misalignments that obscure underlying patterns and degrade model performance. Current methods often address registration (alignment) and classification as separate, sequential tasks. This paper introduces DeepFRC, an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly learns diffeomorphic warping functions and a classifier within a unified architecture. DeepFRC combines a neural deformation operator for elastic alignment, a spectral representation using Fourier basis for smooth functional embedding, and a class-aware contrastive loss that promotes both intra-class coherence and inter-class separation. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for such a joint model, proving its ability to approximate optimal warpings and establishing a data-dependent generalization bound that formally links registration fidelity to classification performance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DeepFRC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both alignment quality and classification accuracy, while ablation studies validate the synergy of its components. DeepFRC also shows notable robustness to noise, missing data, and varying dataset scales. Code is available at https://github.com/Drivergo-93589/DeepFRC.

Abstract: The probabilistic diffusion model (DM), generating content by inferencing through a recursive chain structure, has emerged as a powerful framework for visual generation. After pre-training on enormous data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation, respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a Half-Order (HO) fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The HO gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with lower variance than other methods. We theoretically investigate the bias, variance, and convergence of our method. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.

Abstract: Head computed tomography (CT) imaging is a widely-used imaging modality with multitudes of medical indications, particularly in assessing pathology of the brain, skull, and cerebrovascular system. It is commonly the first-line imaging in neurologic emergencies given its rapidity of image acquisition, safety, cost, and ubiquity. Deep learning models may facilitate detection of a wide range of diseases. However, the scarcity of high-quality labels and annotations, particularly among less common conditions, significantly hinders the development of powerful models. To address this challenge, we introduce FM-CT: a Foundation Model for Head CT for generalizable disease detection, trained using self-supervised learning. Our approach pre-trains a deep learning model on a large, diverse dataset of 361,663 non-contrast 3D head CT scans without the need for manual annotations, enabling the model to learn robust, generalizable features. To investigate the potential of self-supervised learning in head CT, we employed both discrimination with self-distillation and masked image modeling, and we construct our model in 3D rather than at the slice level (2D) to exploit the structure of head CT scans more comprehensively and efficiently. The model's downstream classification performance is evaluated using internal and three external datasets, encompassing both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results demonstrate that the self-supervised foundation model significantly improves performance on downstream diagnostic tasks compared to models trained from scratch and previous 3D CT foundation models on scarce annotated datasets. This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised learning in medical imaging and sets a new benchmark for head CT image analysis in 3D, enabling broader use of artificial intelligence for head CT-based diagnosis.

Abstract: Novel View synthesis (NVS) techniques, notably Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), can augment camera pose estimation by extending training data with rendered images. However, the images rendered by these methods are often plagued by blurring, undermining their reliability as training data for camera pose estimation. This limitation is particularly critical for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which aim at pixel-level 3D coordinate estimation, because rendering artifacts directly lead to estimation inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-criteria filtering mechanism that dynamically identifies and discards suboptimal pixels during training. The dual-criteria filter evaluates two concurrent metrics: (1) real-time SCR reprojection error, and (2) gradient threshold, across the coordinate regression domain. In addition, for visual localization problems in sparse input scenarios, it will be even more necessary to use data generated by NVS to assist the localization task. We design a coarse-to-fine PoI variant using sparse input NVS to solve this problem. Experiments across indoor and outdoor benchmarks confirm our method's efficacy. It achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: In semi-supervised medical image segmentation, the poor quality of unlabeled data and the uncertainty in the model's predictions lead to models that inevitably produce erroneous pseudo-labels. These errors accumulate throughout model training, thereby weakening the model's performance. We found that these erroneous pseudo-labels are typically concentrated in high-uncertainty regions. Traditional methods improve performance by directly discarding pseudo-labels in these regions, which can also result in neglecting potentially valuable training data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional uncertainty-aware region learning strategy to fully utilize the precise supervision provided by labeled data and stabilize the training of unlabeled data. Specifically, in the training labeled data, we focus on high-uncertainty regions, using precise label information to guide the model's learning in potentially uncontrollable areas. Meanwhile, in the training of unlabeled data, we concentrate on low-uncertainty regions to reduce the interference of erroneous pseudo-labels on the model. Through this bidirectional learning strategy, the model's overall performance has significantly improved. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant performance improvement on different medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: We present a novel 3D mapping pipeline for large-scale indoor environments. To address the significant challenges in large-scale indoor scenes, such as prevalent occlusions and textureless regions, we propose IM360, a novel approach that leverages the wide field of view of omnidirectional images and integrates the spherical camera model into the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline. Our SfM utilizes dense matching features specifically designed for 360 images, demonstrating superior capability in image registration. Furthermore, with the aid of mesh-based neural rendering techniques, we introduce a texture optimization method that refines texture maps and accurately captures view-dependent properties by combining diffuse and specular components. We evaluate our pipeline on large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. In practice, IM360 demonstrates superior performance, achieving a 3.5 PSNR increase in textured mesh reconstruction. We attain state-of-the-art performance in terms of camera localization and registration on Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D.

Abstract: We present VPNeXt, a new and simple model for the Plain Vision Transformer (ViT). Unlike the many related studies that share the same homogeneous paradigms, VPNeXt offers a fresh perspective on dense representation based on ViT. In more detail, the proposed VPNeXt addressed two concerns about the existing paradigm: (1) Is it necessary to use a complex Transformer Mask Decoder architecture to obtain good representations? (2) Does the Plain ViT really need to depend on the mock pyramid feature for upsampling? For (1), we investigated the potential underlying reasons that contributed to the effectiveness of the Transformer Decoder and introduced the Visual Context Replay (VCR) to achieve similar effects efficiently. For (2), we introduced the ViTUp module. This module fully utilizes the previously overlooked ViT real pyramid feature to achieve better upsampling results compared to the earlier mock pyramid feature. This represents the first instance of such functionality in the field of semantic segmentation for Plain ViT. We performed ablation studies on related modules to verify their effectiveness gradually. We conducted relevant comparative experiments and visualizations to show that VPNeXt achieved state-of-the-art performance with a simple and effective design. Moreover, the proposed VPNeXt significantly exceeded the long-established mIoU wall/barrier of the VOC2012 dataset, setting a new state-of-the-art by a large margin, which also stands as the largest improvement since 2015.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as a promising alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), offering biological plausibility and energy efficiency. Despite these merits, SNNs are frequently hampered by limited capacity and insufficient representation power, yet remain underexplored in remote sensing super-resolution (SR) tasks. In this paper, we first observe that spiking signals exhibit drastic intensity variations across diverse textures, highlighting an active learning state of the neurons. This observation motivates us to apply SNNs for efficient SR of RSIs. Inspired by the success of attention mechanisms in representing salient information, we devise the spiking attention block (SAB), a concise yet effective component that optimizes membrane potentials through inferred attention weights, which, in turn, regulates spiking activity for superior feature representation. Our key contributions include: 1) we bridge the independent modulation between temporal and channel dimensions, facilitating joint feature correlation learning, and 2) we access the global self-similar patterns in large-scale remote sensing imagery to infer spatial attention weights, incorporating effective priors for realistic and faithful reconstruction. Building upon SAB, we proposed SpikeSR, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across various remote sensing benchmarks such as AID, DOTA, and DIOR, while maintaining high computational efficiency. The code of SpikeSR will be available upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: High-precision dichotomous image segmentation (DIS) is a task of extracting fine-grained objects from high-resolution images. Existing methods face a dilemma: non-diffusion methods work efficiently but suffer from false or missed detections due to weak semantics and less robust spatial priors; diffusion methods, using strong generative priors, have high accuracy but encounter high computational burdens. As a solution, we find pseudo depth information from monocular depth estimation models can provide essential semantic understanding that quickly reveals spatial differences across target objects and backgrounds. Inspired by this phenomenon, we discover a novel insight we term the depth integrity-prior: in pseudo depth maps, foreground objects consistently convey stable depth values with much lower variances than chaotic background patterns. To exploit such a prior, we propose a Prior of Depth Fusion Network (PDFNet). Specifically, our network establishes multimodal interactive modeling to achieve depth-guided structural perception by deeply fusing RGB and pseudo depth features. We further introduce a novel depth integrity-prior loss to explicitly enforce depth consistency in segmentation results. Additionally, we design a fine-grained perception enhancement module with adaptive patch selection to perform boundary-sensitive detail refinement. Notably, PDFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 94M parameters (<11% of those diffusion-based models), outperforming all non-diffusion methods and surpassing some diffusion methods. Code is provided in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: Generating coherent long-form video sequences from discrete input using only text prompts is a critical task in content creation. While diffusion-based models excel at short video synthesis, long-form storytelling from text remains largely unexplored and a challenge due to difficulties in temporal coherency, preserving semantic meaning, and maintaining both scene context and action continuity across the video. We introduce a novel storytelling framework that achieves this by integrating scene and action prompts through dynamics-inspired prompt mixing. Specifically, we first present a bidirectional time-weighted latent blending strategy to ensure temporal consistency between segments of the long-form video being generated. We then propose a dynamics-informed prompt weighting (DIPW) mechanism that adaptively balances the influence of scene and action prompts at each diffusion timestep by jointly considering CLIP-based alignment, narrative continuity, and temporal smoothness. To further enhance motion continuity, we incorporate a semantic action representation to encode high-level action semantics into the blending process, dynamically adjusting transitions based on action similarity and ensuring smooth yet adaptable motion changes. Latent space blending maintains spatial coherence between objects in a scene, while time-weighted blending enforces bidirectional constraints for temporal consistency. The resulting integrative system prevents abrupt transitions while ensuring fluid storytelling that faithfully reflects both scene and action cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, achieving temporally consistent and visually compelling video narratives without any additional training. This approach bridges the gap between short clips and extended video to establish a new paradigm in GenAI-driven video synthesis from text.

Abstract: We address the challenge of Small Object Image Retrieval (SoIR), where the goal is to retrieve images containing a specific small object, in a cluttered scene. The key challenge in this setting is constructing a single image descriptor, for scalable and efficient search, that effectively represents all objects in the image. In this paper, we first analyze the limitations of existing methods on this challenging task and then introduce new benchmarks to support SoIR evaluation. Next, we introduce Multi-object Attention Optimization (MaO), a novel retrieval framework which incorporates a dedicated multi-object pre-training phase. This is followed by a refinement process that leverages attention-based feature extraction with object masks, integrating them into a single unified image descriptor. Our MaO approach significantly outperforms existing retrieval methods and strong baselines, achieving notable improvements in both zero-shot and lightweight multi-object fine-tuning. We hope this work will lay the groundwork and inspire further research to enhance retrieval performance for this highly practical task.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale natural images are widely adapted to various cross-domain low-resource downstream tasks, benefiting from generalizable and transferable patterns captured by their representations. However, these representations are later found to gradually vanish during finetuning, accompanied by a degradation of model's original generalizability. In this paper, we argue that such tasks can be effectively adapted without sacrificing the benefits of pretrained representations. We approach this by introducing \textit{Representation Invariance FineTuning (RIFT)}, a regularization that maximizes the representation similarity between pretrained and finetuned models by leveraging orthogonal invariance of manifolds in a computationally efficient way. Experiments demonstrate that our method is compatible with mainstream finetuning methods, offering competitive or even enhanced performance and better preservation of the generalizability.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in fundamental cross-modality research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily faces two challenges: $\textbf{(1)}$ $\textbf{fragmentation development}$, with existing methods failing to unify understanding and generation into a single one, hindering the way to artificial general intelligence. $\textbf{(2) lack of fine-grained facial attributes}$, which are crucial for high-fidelity applications. To handle those issues, we propose $\textbf{UniF$^2$ace}$, $\textit{the first UMM specifically tailored for fine-grained face understanding and generation}$. $\textbf{First}$, we introduce a novel theoretical framework with a Dual Discrete Diffusion (D3Diff) loss, unifying masked generative models with discrete score matching diffusion and leading to a more precise approximation of the negative log-likelihood. Moreover, this D3Diff significantly enhances the model's ability to synthesize high-fidelity facial details aligned with text input. $\textbf{Second}$, we propose a multi-level grouped Mixture-of-Experts architecture, adaptively incorporating the semantic and identity facial embeddings to complement the attribute forgotten phenomenon in representation evolvement. $\textbf{Finally}$, to this end, we construct UniF$^2$aceD-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 130K fine-grained image-caption pairs and 1M visual question-answering pairs, spanning a much wider range of facial attributes than existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniF$^2$ace outperforms existing models with a similar scale in both understanding and generation tasks, with 7.1\% higher Desc-GPT and 6.6\% higher VQA-score, respectively.

<title>Controllable Adversarial Makeup for Privacy via Text-Guided Diffusion</title>

Abstract: As face recognition becomes more widespread in government and commercial services, its potential misuse raises serious concerns about privacy and civil rights. To counteract this threat, various anti-facial recognition techniques have been proposed, which protect privacy by adversarially perturbing face images. Among these, generative makeup-based approaches are the most widely studied. However, these methods, designed primarily to impersonate specific target identities, can only achieve weak dodging success rates while increasing the risk of targeted abuse. In addition, they often introduce global visual artifacts or a lack of adaptability to accommodate diverse makeup prompts, compromising user satisfaction. To address the above limitations, we develop MASQUE, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates localized adversarial makeups guided by user-defined text prompts. Built upon precise null-text inversion, customized cross-attention fusion with masking, and a pairwise adversarial guidance mechanism using images of the same individual, MASQUE achieves robust dodging performance without requiring any external identity. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source facial recognition models and commercial APIs demonstrate that MASQUE significantly improves dodging success rates over all baselines, along with higher perceptual fidelity preservation, stronger adaptability to various makeup prompts, and robustness to image transformations.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that generates implicit labels by learning underlined patterns and extracting discriminative features from unlabeled data without manual labelling. Contrastive learning introduces the concept of "positive" and "negative" samples, where positive pairs (e.g., variation of the same image/object) are brought together in the embedding space, and negative pairs (e.g., views from different images/objects) are pushed farther away. This methodology has shown significant improvements in image understanding and image text analysis without much reliance on labeled data. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the terminologies, recent developments and applications of contrastive learning with respect to text-image models. Specifically, we provide an overview of the approaches of contrastive learning in text-image models in recent years. Secondly, we categorize the approaches based on different model structures. Thirdly, we further introduce and discuss the latest advances of the techniques used in the process such as pretext tasks for both images and text, architectural structures, and key trends. Lastly, we discuss the recent state-of-art applications of self-supervised contrastive learning Text-Image based models.

Abstract: With the rise of deep neural networks, especially in safety-critical applications, robustness and interpretability are crucial to ensure their trustworthiness. Recent advances in 3D-aware classifiers that map image features to volumetric representation of objects, rather than relying solely on 2D appearance, have greatly improved robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Such classifiers have not yet been studied from the perspective of interpretability. Meanwhile, current concept-based XAI methods often neglect OOD robustness. We aim to address both aspects with CAVE - Concept Aware Volumes for Explanations - a new direction that unifies interpretability and robustness in image classification. We design CAVE as a robust and inherently interpretable classifier that learns sparse concepts from 3D object representation. We further propose 3D Consistency (3D-C), a metric to measure spatial consistency of concepts. Unlike existing metrics that rely on human-annotated parts on images, 3D-C leverages ground-truth object meshes as a common surface to project and compare explanations across concept-based methods. CAVE achieves competitive classification performance while discovering consistent and meaningful concepts across images in various OOD settings.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation is essential for video processing tasks, such as restoration and action recognition. The quality of videos is constantly increasing, with current standards reaching 8K resolution. However, optical flow methods are usually designed for low resolution and do not generalize to large inputs due to their rigid architectures. They adopt downscaling or input tiling to reduce the input size, causing a loss of details and global information. There is also a lack of optical flow benchmarks to judge the actual performance of existing methods on high-resolution samples. Previous works only conducted qualitative high-resolution evaluations on hand-picked samples. This paper fills this gap in optical flow estimation in two ways. We propose DPFlow, an adaptive optical flow architecture capable of generalizing up to 8K resolution inputs while trained with only low-resolution samples. We also introduce Kubric-NK, a new benchmark for evaluating optical flow methods with input resolutions ranging from 1K to 8K. Our high-resolution evaluation pushes the boundaries of existing methods and reveals new insights about their generalization capabilities. Extensive experimental results show that DPFlow achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPI-Sintel, KITTI 2015, Spring, and other high-resolution benchmarks.

<title>Plug-and-Play 1.x-Bit KV Cache Quantization for Video Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Video large language models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated the capability to process longer video inputs and enable complex reasoning and analysis. However, due to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, the key-value (KV) cache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for inference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used approach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV quantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the limit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To bridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization method to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for key, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel dimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit quantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement 1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual tokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and model performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of VideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token fashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically, extensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show that VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit precision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.

Abstract: Self-supervised adaptation (SSA) improves foundation model transfer to medical domains but is computationally prohibitive. Although parameter efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA have been explored for supervised adaptation, their effectiveness for SSA remains unknown. In this work, we introduce efficient self-supervised adaptation (ESSA), a framework that applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to SSA with the aim of reducing computational cost and improving adaptation performance. Among the methods tested, Attention Projection Layer Adaptation (APLA) sets a new state-of-the-art, consistently surpassing full-parameter SSA and supervised fine-tuning across diverse medical tasks, while reducing GPU memory by up to 40.1% and increasing training throughput by 25.2%, all while maintaining inference efficiency.

Abstract: Audio often serves as an auxiliary modality in video understanding tasks of audio-visual large language models (LLMs), merely assisting in the comprehension of visual information. However, a thorough understanding of videos significantly depends on auditory information, as audio offers critical context, emotional cues, and semantic meaning that visual data alone often lacks. This paper proposes an audio-centric video understanding benchmark (AVUT) to evaluate the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal LLMs with a particular focus on auditory information. AVUT introduces a suite of carefully designed audio-centric tasks, holistically testing the understanding of both audio content and audio-visual interactions in videos. Moreover, this work points out the text shortcut problem that largely exists in other benchmarks where the correct answer can be found from question text alone without needing videos. AVUT addresses this problem by proposing a answer permutation-based filtering mechanism. A thorough evaluation across a diverse range of open-source and proprietary multimodal LLMs is performed, followed by the analyses of deficiencies in audio-visual LLMs. Demos and data are available at https://github.com/lark-png/AVUT.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely limited training data while requiring models to acquire new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. Recent works have explored generative models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), to address these challenges. However, existing approaches use SD mainly as a replay generator, whereas we demonstrate that SD's rich multi-scale representations can serve as a unified backbone. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Diffusion-FSCIL, which extracts four synergistic feature types from SD by capturing real image characteristics through inversion, providing semantic diversity via class-conditioned synthesis, enhancing generalization through controlled noise injection, and enabling replay without image storage through generative features. Unlike conventional approaches requiring synthetic buffers and separate classification backbones, our unified framework operates entirely in the latent space with only lightweight networks ($\approx$6M parameters). Extensive experiments on CUB-200, miniImageNet, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with comprehensive ablations confirming the necessity of each feature type. Furthermore, we confirm that our streamlined variant maintains competitive accuracy while substantially improving efficiency, establishing the viability of generative models as practical and effective backbones for FSCIL.

Abstract: Compositionality, or correctly recognizing scenes as compositions of atomic visual concepts, remains difficult for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Even state of the art MLLMs such as GPT-4o can make mistakes in distinguishing compositions like "dog chasing cat" vs "cat chasing dog". While on Winoground, a benchmark for measuring such reasoning, MLLMs have made significant progress, they are still far from a human's performance. We show that compositional reasoning in these models can be improved by elucidating such concepts via data, where a model is trained to prefer the correct caption for an image over a close but incorrect one. We introduce SCRAMBLe: Synthetic Compositional Reasoning Augmentation of MLLMs with Binary preference Learning, an approach for preference tuning open-weight MLLMs on synthetic preference data generated in a fully automated manner from existing image-caption data. SCRAMBLe holistically improves these MLLMs' compositional reasoning capabilities which we can see through significant improvements across multiple vision language compositionality benchmarks, as well as smaller but significant improvements on general question answering tasks. As a sneak peek, SCRAMBLe tuned Molmo-7B model improves on Winoground from 49.5% to 54.8% (best reported to date), while improving by ~1% on more general visual question answering tasks. Code for SCRAMBLe along with tuned models and our synthetic training dataset is available at https://github.com/samarth4149/SCRAMBLe.

<title>From Specificity to Generality: Revisiting Generalizable Artifacts in Detecting Face Deepfakes</title>

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has been an increasingly important topic, especially given the rapid development of AI generation techniques. In this paper, we ask: How can we build a universal detection framework that is effective for most facial deepfakes? One significant challenge is the wide variety of deepfake generators available, resulting in varying forgery artifacts (e.g., lighting inconsistency, color mismatch, etc). But should we ``teach" the detector to learn all these artifacts separately? It is impossible and impractical to elaborate on them all. So the core idea is to pinpoint the more common and general artifacts across different deepfakes. Accordingly, we categorize deepfake artifacts into two distinct yet complementary types: Face Inconsistency Artifacts (FIA) and Up-Sampling Artifacts (USA). FIA arise from the challenge of generating all intricate details, inevitably causing inconsistencies between the complex facial features and relatively uniform surrounding areas. USA, on the other hand, are the inevitable traces left by the generator's decoder during the up-sampling process. This categorization stems from the observation that all existing deepfakes typically exhibit one or both of these artifacts. To achieve this, we propose a new data-level pseudo-fake creation framework that constructs fake samples with only the FIA and USA, without introducing extra less-general artifacts. Specifically, we employ a super-resolution to simulate the USA, while design a Blender module that uses image-level self-blending on diverse facial regions to create the FIA. We surprisingly found that, with this intuitive design, a standard image classifier trained only with our pseudo-fake data can non-trivially generalize well to unseen deepfakes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), they still struggle with fine-grained temporal understanding, hallucinate, and often make simple mistakes on even simple video question-answering tasks, all of which pose significant challenges to their safe and reliable deployment in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose a self-alignment framework that enables LVLMs to learn from their own errors. Our proposed framework first obtains a training set of preferred and non-preferred response pairs, where non-preferred responses are generated by incorporating common error patterns that often occur due to inadequate spatio-temporal understanding, spurious correlations between co-occurring concepts, and over-reliance on linguistic cues while neglecting the vision modality, among others. To facilitate self-alignment of LVLMs with the constructed preferred and non-preferred response pairs, we introduce Refined Regularized Preference Optimization (RRPO), a novel preference optimization method that utilizes sub-sequence-level refined rewards and token-wise KL regularization to address the limitations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We demonstrate that RRPO achieves more precise alignment and more stable training compared to DPO. Our experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse video tasks, including video hallucination, short- and long-video understanding, and fine-grained temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Semi-supervised change detection (SSCD) aims to detect changes between bi-temporal remote sensing images by utilizing limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. Existing methods struggle in complex scenarios, exhibiting poor performance when confronted with noisy data. They typically neglect intra-layer multi-scale features while emphasizing inter-layer fusion, harming the integrity of change objects with different scales. In this paper, we propose HSACNet, a Hierarchical Scale-Aware Consistency regularized Network for SSCD. Specifically, we integrate Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), using its Hiera backbone as the encoder to extract inter-layer multi-scale features and applying adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Moreover, we design a Scale-Aware Differential Attention Module (SADAM) that can precisely capture intra-layer multi-scale change features and suppress noise. Additionally, a dual-augmentation consistency regularization strategy is adopted to effectively utilize the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments across four CD benchmarks demonstrate that our HSACNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with reduced parameters and computational cost.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis, yet it faces three major challenges: insufficient multi-scale feature fusion, disruption of contextual continuity, and noise interference. This study proposes a dual-stage solution to address these issues. The first stage employs a Reversible Multi-Scale Fusion Module (RMS) that uses hierarchical adaptive convolution to dynamically merge cross-scale features from capillaries to main vessels, self-adaptively calibrating feature biases. The second stage introduces a Vascular-Oriented Attention Mechanism, which models long-distance vascular continuity through an axial pathway and enhances the capture of topological key nodes, such as bifurcation points, via a dedicated bifurcation attention pathway. The synergistic operation of these two pathways effectively restores the continuity of vascular structures and improves the segmentation accuracy of complex vascular networks. Systematic experiments on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE-DB1 datasets demonstrate that WMKA-Net achieves an accuracy of 0.9909, sensitivity of 0.9198, and specificity of 0.9953, significantly outperforming existing methods. This model provides an efficient, precise, and robust intelligent solution for the early screening of diabetic retinopathy.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the metric 3D shape and motion of wild dolphins from monocular video, with the aim of assessing their body condition. While considerable progress has been made in reconstructing 3D models of terrestrial quadrupeds, aquatic animals remain unexplored due to the difficulty of observing them in their natural underwater environment. To address this, we propose a model-based approach that incorporates a transmission model to account for water-induced occlusion. We apply our method to video captured under different sea conditions. We estimate mass and volume, and compare our results to a manual 2D measurements-based method. Additionally, we apply our method to video of captive animals with known ground truth mass. While in our experiments the manual approach is often more accurate, our method demonstrates a distinct advantage when applied to larger specimen. These findings highlight the potential of our method as a scalable and automated alternative for mass and volume estimation of dolphins from monocular video.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on image customization (e.g., identity, subject, style, background, etc.) demonstrates strong customization capabilities in large-scale generative models. However, most approaches are designed for specific tasks, restricting their generalizability to combine different types of condition. Developing a unified framework for image customization remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present DreamO, an image customization framework designed to support a wide range of tasks while facilitating seamless integration of multiple conditions. Specifically, DreamO utilizes a diffusion transformer (DiT) framework to uniformly process input of different types. During training, we construct a large-scale training dataset that includes various customization tasks, and we introduce a feature routing constraint to facilitate the precise querying of relevant information from reference images. Additionally, we design a placeholder strategy that associates specific placeholders with conditions at particular positions, enabling control over the placement of conditions in the generated results. Moreover, we employ a progressive training strategy consisting of three stages: an initial stage focused on simple tasks with limited data to establish baseline consistency, a full-scale training stage to comprehensively enhance the customization capabilities, and a final quality alignment stage to correct quality biases introduced by low-quality data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DreamO can effectively perform various image customization tasks with high quality and flexibly integrate different types of control conditions.

Abstract: Collective Perception (CP) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the limitations of individual perception in the context of autonomous driving. Various approaches have been proposed to realize collective perception; however, the Sensor2Sensor domain gap that arises from the utilization of different sensor systems in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) remains mostly unaddressed. This is primarily due to the paucity of datasets containing heterogeneous sensor setups among the CAVs. The recently released SCOPE datasets address this issue by providing data from three different LiDAR sensors for each CAV. This study is the first to address the Sensor2Sensor domain gap in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) collective perception. First, we present our sensor-domain robust architecture S2S-Net. Then an in-depth analysis of the Sensor2Sensor domain adaptation capabilities of state-of-the-art CP methods and S2S-Net is conducted on the SCOPE dataset. This study shows that, all evaluated state-of-the-art mehtods for collective perception highly suffer from the Sensor2Sensor domain gap, while S2S-Net demonstrates the capability to maintain very high performance in unseen sensor domains and outperforms the evaluated state-of-the-art methods by up to 44 percentage points.

Abstract: Reactive dance generation (RDG), the task of generating a dance conditioned on a lead dancer's motion, holds significant promise for enhancing human-robot interaction and immersive digital entertainment. Despite progress in duet synchronization and motion-music alignment, two key challenges remain: generating fine-grained spatial interactions and ensuring long-term temporal coherence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{ReactDance}, a diffusion framework that operates on a novel hierarchical latent space to address these spatiotemporal challenges in RDG. First, for high-fidelity spatial expression and fine-grained control, we propose Hierarchical Finite Scalar Quantization (\textbf{HFSQ}). This multi-scale motion representation effectively disentangles coarse body posture from subtle limb dynamics, enabling independent and detailed control over both aspects through a layered guidance mechanism. Second, to efficiently generate long sequences with high temporal coherence, we propose Blockwise Local Context (\textbf{BLC}), a non-autoregressive sampling strategy. Departing from slow, frame-by-frame generation, BLC partitions the sequence into blocks and synthesizes them in parallel via periodic causal masking and positional encodings. Coherence across these blocks is ensured by a dense sliding-window training approach that enriches the representation with local temporal context. Extensive experiments show that ReactDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in motion quality, long-term coherence, and sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Text-to-image person search aims to identify an individual based on a text description. To reduce data collection costs, large-scale text-image datasets are created from co-occurrence pairs found online. However, this can introduce noise, particularly mismatched pairs, which degrade retrieval performance. Existing methods often focus on negative samples, which amplify this noise. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Uncertainty and Relational Alignment (DURA) framework, which includes the Key Feature Selector (KFS) and a new loss function, Dynamic Softmax Hinge Loss (DSH-Loss). KFS captures and models noise uncertainty, improving retrieval reliability. The bidirectional evi- dence from cross-modal similarity is modeled as a Dirichlet distribution, enhancing adaptability to noisy data. DSH adjusts the difficulty of neg- ative samples to improve robustness in noisy environments. Our exper- iments on three datasets show that the method offers strong noise re- sistance and improves retrieval performance in both low- and high-noise scenarios.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3\text{B}\sim14\text{B}$, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.

Abstract: Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers. The code and weights are released at: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VFRTok.

Abstract: Large vision-language models exhibit inherent capabilities to handle diverse visual perception tasks. In this paper, we introduce VisionReasoner, a unified framework capable of reasoning and solving multiple visual perception tasks within a shared model. Specifically, by designing a unified reward mechanism and multi-object cognitive learning strategies, VisionReasoner enhances its reasoning capabilities to analyze visual inputs, and addresses diverse perception tasks within a unified model. VisionReasoner generates a structured reasoning process before delivering the desired outputs responding to user queries. Human evaluation reveals the reasoning process of VisionReasoner is faithful and reliable even without annotated reasoning train data. To rigorously assess unified visual perception capabilities, we evaluate VisionReasoner on ten diverse tasks spanning three critical domains: detection, segmentation, and counting. Experimental results show that VisionReasoner achieves superior performance as a unified model, outperforming the baseline Qwen2.5VL by relative margins of 29.1\% on COCO (detection), 22.1\% on ReasonSeg (segmentation), and 15.3\% on CountBench (counting).

Abstract: World models, which predict future transitions from past observation and action sequences, have shown great promise for improving data efficiency in sequential decision-making. However, existing world models often require extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse predictions, limiting their usefulness in complex environments. In contrast, video diffusion models trained on large-scale internet data have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos that capture diverse real-world dynamics. In this work, we present Vid2World, a general approach for leveraging and transferring pre-trained video diffusion models into interactive world models. To bridge the gap, Vid2World systematically explores video diffusion causalization, reshaping both the architecture and training objective of pre-trained models to enable autoregressive generation. Additionally, it incorporates a causal action guidance mechanism to enhance action controllability in the resulting interactive world models. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including robot manipulation, 3D game simulation, and open-world navigation, demonstrate that our method offers a scalable and effective pathway for repurposing highly capable video diffusion models into interactive world models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown capabilities in interpreting visual content, but their reliability in safety-critical scenarios remains insufficiently explored. We introduce VERI, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 200 synthetic images (100 contrastive pairs) and an additional 50 real-world images (25 pairs) for validation. Each emergency scene is paired with a visually similar but safe counterpart through human verification. Using a two-stage evaluation protocol (risk identification and emergency response), we assess 17 VLMs across medical emergencies, accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals an "overreaction problem": models achieve high recall (70-100%) but suffer from low precision, misclassifying 31-96% of safe situations as dangerous. Seven safe scenarios were universally misclassified by all models. This "better-safe-than-sorry" bias stems from contextual overinterpretation (88-98% of errors). Both synthetic and real-world datasets confirm these systematic patterns, challenging VLM reliability in safety-critical applications. Addressing this requires enhanced contextual reasoning in ambiguous visual situations.

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucination, often generating content misaligned with visual inputs. Although recent training-based approaches aim to mitigate hallucination, they typically rely on predefined or randomly edited negative samples that do not reflect actual model errors, thus limiting training efficacy. In this work, we propose an Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP) framework that dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the model's own hallucinated outputs. By identifying semantic differences between sampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion model, OViP generates more relevant supervision signals in real time. This failure-driven training enables adaptive alignment of both textual and visual preferences. Moreover, we refine existing evaluation protocols to better capture the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness. Experiments on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate that OViP not only reduces hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal capabilities, but also substantially improves training efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/lsjlsj35/Online-Vision-Language-Preference-Learning-for-VLM-Hallucination.

Abstract: Recent advances in scene-based video generation have enabled systems to synthesize coherent visual narratives from structured prompts. However, a crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior. While a story generation model such as Text2Story produces the corresponding visual scene, we focus on generating expressive, character-consistent utterances grounded in both the prompts and the scene image. A pretrained vision-language encoder extracts high-level semantic features from a representative frame, capturing salient visual context. These features are then integrated with structured prompts to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural dialogue. To ensure contextual and emotional consistency across scenes, we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank -- a speaker-aware, temporally structured memory that recursively accumulates each character's dialogue history. Inspired by Script Theory in cognitive psychology, this design enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals, social context, and narrative roles throughout the story. Finally, we render each utterance as expressive, character-conditioned speech, resulting in fully-voiced, multimodal video narratives. Our training-free framework generalizes across diverse story settings -- from fantasy adventures to slice-of-life episodes -- offering a scalable solution for coherent, character-grounded audiovisual storytelling.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on tasks such as visual question answering, but it remains unclear whether their reasoning relies more on memorized world knowledge or on the visual information present in the input image. To investigate this, we introduce Visual CounterFact, a new dataset of visually-realistic counterfactuals that put world knowledge priors (e.g, red strawberry) into direct conflict with visual input (e.g, blue strawberry). Using Visual CounterFact, we show that model predictions initially reflect memorized priors, but shift toward visual evidence in mid-to-late layers. This dynamic reveals a competition between the two modalities, with visual input ultimately overriding priors during evaluation. To control this behavior, we propose Pixels Versus Priors (PvP) steering vectors, a mechanism for controlling model outputs toward either world knowledge or visual input through activation-level interventions. On average, PvP successfully shifts 99.3% of color and 80.8% of size predictions from priors to counterfactuals. Together, these findings offer new tools for interpreting and controlling factual behavior in multimodal models.

Abstract: Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements, including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce InfoDet, a dataset designed to support the development of accurate object detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 11,264 real and 90,000 synthetic infographics, with over 14 million bounding box annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of InfoDet through three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI element detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have significantly enhanced the quality of generated videos. However, their capability to produce explicit or harmful content introduces new challenges related to misuse and potential rights violations. To address this newly emerging threat, we propose unlearning-based concept erasing as a solution. First, we adopt negatively-guided velocity prediction fine-tuning and enhance it with prompt augmentation to ensure robustness against prompts refined by large language models (LLMs). Second, to achieve precise unlearning, we incorporate mask-based localization regularization and concept preservation regularization to preserve the model's ability to generate non-target concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively erases a specific concept while preserving the model's generation capability for all other concepts, outperforming existing methods. We provide the unlearned models in \href{https://github.com/VDIGPKU/T2VUnlearning.git}{https://github.com/VDIGPKU/T2VUnlearning.git}.

Abstract: The open set recognition (OSR) problem aims to identify test samples from novel semantic classes that are not part of the training classes, a task that is crucial in many practical scenarios. However, the existing OSR methods use a constant scaling factor (the temperature) to the logits before applying a loss function, which hinders the model from exploring both ends of the spectrum in representation learning -- from instance-level to semantic-level features. In this paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated representation learning using a set of proposed temperature schedules, including our novel negative cosine schedule. Our temperature schedules allow the model to form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of training by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more neighbors to smooth out the rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a richer and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods benefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with mix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our schedules can be folded into any existing OSR loss function with no overhead. We implement the novel schedule on top of a number of baselines, using cross-entropy, contrastive and the ARPL loss functions and find that it boosts both the OSR and the closed set performance in most cases, especially on the tougher semantic shift benchmarks. Project codes will be available.

Abstract: Reasoning Video Object Segmentation is a challenging task, aiming at generating a mask sequence from an input video given a complex and implicit text query. While existing works finetune Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for the task, they still fail in video inputs given complex temporally-sensitive queries, indicating their lack of temporal and spatial integration in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose CoT-RVS, a novel framework employing the zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these complex challenges by temporal-semantic reasoning: CoT-RVS analyzes the visible objects within a given frame that possibly match the language query (semantic), and chooses a corresponding keyframe for each object that can be observed effortlessly among all frames (temporal). Notably, the CoT-RVS framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs, which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. Our framework's training-free feature further allows its extension to process online video streams, where the CoT is used at test time to update the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with explicit and implicit queries. The results show that CoT-RVS significantly outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of user-provided concepts in diverse contexts. Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It introduces vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pre-training strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.

Abstract: In the visual generative area, discrete diffusion models are gaining traction for their efficiency and compatibility. However, pioneered attempts still fall behind their continuous counterparts, which we attribute to noise (absorbing state) design and sampling heuristics. In this study, we propose a rehashing noise approach for discrete diffusion transformer (termed ReDDiT), with the aim to extend absorbing states and improve expressive capacity of discrete diffusion models. ReDDiT enriches the potential paths that latent variables traverse during training with randomized multi-index corruption. The derived rehash sampler, which reverses the randomized absorbing paths, guarantees high diversity and low discrepancy of the generation process. These reformulations lead to more consistent and competitive generation quality, mitigating the need for heavily tuned randomness. Experiments show that ReDDiT significantly outperforms the baseline model (reducing gFID from 6.18 to 1.61) and is on par with the continuous counterparts.

Abstract: Generalizable active mapping in complex unknown environments remains a critical challenge for mobile robots. Existing methods, constrained by insufficient training data and conservative exploration strategies, exhibit limited generalizability across scenes with diverse layouts and complex connectivity. To enable scalable training and reliable evaluation, we introduce GLEAM-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for generalizable active mapping with 1,152 diverse 3D scenes from synthetic and real-scan datasets. Building upon this foundation, we propose GLEAM, a unified generalizable exploration policy for active mapping. Its superior generalizability comes mainly from our semantic representations, long-term navigable goals, and randomized strategies. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 66.50% coverage (+9.49%) with efficient trajectories and improved mapping accuracy on 128 unseen complex scenes.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve impressive performance in high-fidelity image generation but often struggle with rare concepts that appear infrequently in the training distribution. Prior work attempts to address this issue by prompt switching, where generation begins with a frequent proxy prompt and later transitions to the original rare prompt. However, such designs typically rely on fixed schedules that disregard the model's internal dynamics, making them brittle across prompts and backbones. In this paper, we re-frame rare prompt generation through the lens of score replacement: the denoising trajectory of a rare prompt can be initially guided by the score of a semantically related frequent prompt, which acts as a proxy. However, as the process unfolds, the proxy score gradually diverges from the true rare prompt score. To control this drift, we introduce a bounded deviation criterion that triggers the switch once the deviation exceeds a threshold. This formulation offers both a principled justification and a practical mechanism for rare prompt generation, enabling adaptive switching that can be widely adopted by different models. Extensive experiments across SDXL, SD3, Flux, and Sana confirm that our method consistently improves rare concept synthesis, outperforming strong baselines in both automated metrics and human evaluations.

Abstract: Video Virtual Try-On (VVT) aims to synthesize garments that appear natural across consecutive video frames, capturing both their dynamics and interactions with human motion. Despite recent progress, existing VVT methods still suffer from inadequate garment fidelity and limited spatiotemporal consistency. The reasons are: (1) under-exploitation of garment information, with limited garment cues being injected, resulting in weaker fine-detail fidelity; and (2) a lack of spatiotemporal modeling, which hampers cross-frame identity consistency and causes temporal jitter and appearance drift. In this paper, we present MagicTryOn, a diffusion-transformer based framework for garment-preserving video virtual try-on. To preserve fine-grained garment details, we propose a fine-grained garment-preservation strategy that disentangles garment cues and injects these decomposed priors into the denoising process. To improve temporal garment consistency and suppress jitter, we introduce a garment-aware spatiotemporal rotary positional embedding (RoPE) that extends RoPE within full self-attention, using spatiotemporal relative positions to modulate garment tokens. We further impose a mask-aware loss during training to enhance fidelity within garment regions. Moreover, we adopt distribution-matching distillation to compress the sampling trajectory to four steps, enabling real-time inference without degrading garment fidelity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MagicTryOn outperforms existing methods, delivering superior garment-detail fidelity and temporal stability in unconstrained settings.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for camera simulation, enabling both geometric transformations and realistic optical effects. Among these, image-based bokeh rendering has shown promising results, but diffusion for video bokeh remains unexplored. Existing image-based methods are plagued by temporal flickering and inconsistent blur transitions, while current video editing methods lack explicit control over the focus plane and bokeh intensity. These issues limit their applicability for controllable video bokeh. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion framework for generating temporally coherent, depth-aware video bokeh rendering. The framework employs a multi-plane image (MPI) representation adapted to the focal plane to condition the video diffusion model, thereby enabling it to exploit strong 3D priors from pretrained backbones. To further enhance temporal stability, depth robustness, and detail preservation, we introduce a progressive training strategy. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate superior temporal coherence, spatial accuracy, and controllability, outperforming prior baselines. This work represents the first dedicated diffusion framework for video bokeh generation, establishing a new baseline for temporally coherent and controllable depth-of-field effects. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation increasingly demands access to domain-specific, fine-grained, and rapidly evolving knowledge that pretrained models cannot fully capture, necessitating the integration of retrieval methods. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in the retrieval and further contributes to generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.

Abstract: Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a cornerstone of structural biology, enabling near-atomic resolution analysis of macromolecules through advanced computational methods. However, the development of cryo-EM processing tools is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets. Synthetic data generation offers a promising alternative, but existing approaches lack thorough biophysical modeling of heterogeneity and fail to reproduce the complex noise observed in real imaging. To address these limitations, we present CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that unifies versatile biophysical modeling with the first conditional cycle-consistent diffusion model tailored for cryo-EM. The biophysical engine provides multi-functional generation capabilities to capture authentic biological organization, and the diffusion model is enhanced with cycle consistency and mask-guided contrastive learning to ensure realistic noise while preserving structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CryoCCD generates structurally faithful micrographs, enhances particle picking and pose estimation, as well as achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, while also generalizing effectively to held-out protein families.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have pushed the boundaries of the visual reasoning capabilities in large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, training LVLMs with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is computationally expensive, posing a significant challenge to scaling model size. In this work, we propose ProxyThinker, an inference-time technique that enables large models to inherit the visual reasoning capabilities from small, slow-thinking visual reasoners without any training. By subtracting the output distributions of base models from those of RFT reasoners, ProxyThinker modifies the decoding dynamics and successfully elicits the slow-thinking reasoning demonstrated by the emerged sophisticated behaviors such as self-verification and self-correction. ProxyThinker consistently boosts performance on challenging visual benchmarks on spatial, mathematical, and multi-disciplinary reasoning, enabling untuned base models to compete with the performance of their full-scale RFT counterparts. Furthermore, our implementation efficiently coordinates multiple language models with parallelism techniques and achieves up to 38 $\times$ faster inference compared to previous decoding-time methods, paving the way for the practical deployment of ProxyThinker. Code is available at https://github.com/MrZilinXiao/ProxyThinker.

Abstract: Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Yet, existing work on procedure-aware video representations fails to explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by LLMs as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, and more. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks.

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) data analysis is vital for monitoring environmental and human dynamics. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show potential in EO understanding but remain restricted to single-sensor inputs, overlooking the complementarity across heterogeneous modalities. We propose EarthMind, a unified vision-language framework that handles both single- and cross-sensor inputs via an innovative hierarchical cross-modal attention (ie, HCA) design. Specifically, HCA hierarchically captures visual relationships across sensors and aligns them with language queries, enabling adaptive fusion of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) features. To support cross-sensor learning, we curate FusionEO, a 30K-pair dataset with diverse annotations, and establish EarthMind-Bench, a 2,841-pair benchmark with expert annotations for perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that EarthMind achieves state-of-the-art results on EarthMind-Bench and surpasses existing MLLMs on multiple EO benchmarks.

Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in egocentric videos presents unique challenges due to unstable viewpoints, motion blur, and off-screen speech sources - conditions under which traditional visual-centric methods degrade significantly. We introduce PAIR-Net (Pretrained Audio-Visual Integration with Regularization Network), an effective model that integrates a partially frozen Whisper audio encoder with a fine-tuned AV-HuBERT visual backbone to robustly fuse cross-modal cues. To counteract modality imbalance, we introduce an inter-modal alignment loss that synchronizes audio and visual representations, enabling more consistent convergence across modalities. Without relying on multi-speaker context or ideal frontal views, PAIR-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Ego4D ASD benchmark with 76.6% mAP, surpassing LoCoNet and STHG by 8.2% and 12.9% mAP, respectively. Our results highlight the value of pretrained audio priors and alignment-based fusion for robust ASD under real-world egocentric conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to understand video content. Nonetheless, processing long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1) event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and (3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.

Abstract: Unlocking spatial reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is crucial for enabling intelligent interaction with 3D environments. While prior efforts often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask: can LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs (e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories, generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM (Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively bridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Although diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation becomes particularly critical in practical applications such as advertising and marketing, where preserving the identity of featured individuals is essential for a campaign's effectiveness. It is particularly severe when subjects are distant from the camera or appear within a group, frequently leading to a significant loss of identity. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized image synthesis. Key contributions include the "Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, which significantly enhances identity retention in complex scenes, and a training-free content consistency loss that improves the preservation of fine-grained details by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially exceeds the baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust identity integrity, all without necessitating model retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is crucial for understanding complex multimodal data and advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Existing methods enhance the reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning (e.g., GRPO). However, current RL approaches sample action groups solely from the policy model itself, which limits the upper boundary of the model's reasoning capability and leads to inefficient training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel RL framework called \textbf{Vision-EKIPL}. The core of this framework lies in introducing high-quality actions generated by external auxiliary models during the RL training process to guide the optimization of the policy model. The policy learning with knowledge infusion from external models significantly expands the model's exploration space, effectively improves the reasoning boundary, and substantially accelerates training convergence speed and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Vision-EKIPL achieved up to a 5\% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It reveals that Vision-EKIPL can overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, significantly enhance the visual reasoning performance of MLLMs, and provide a new effective paradigm for research in this field.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored leveraging the world knowledge and cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address the long-tail problem in end-to-end autonomous driving. However, existing methods typically formulate trajectory planning as a language modeling task, where physical actions are output in the language space, potentially leading to issues such as format-violating outputs, infeasible actions, and slow inference speeds. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, a novel Reinforced Cognitive framework for end-to-end autonomous Driving, unifying driving understanding and planning by integrating an autoregressive model with a diffusion planner. First, to instill human driving cognition into the VLM, we introduce a hierarchical data pipeline that mimics the sequential cognitive process of human drivers through three stages: generation, refinement, and quality control. Building on this cognitive foundation, we then address the language-action mismatch by injecting the VLM's learned driving priors into a diffusion planner to efficiently generate continuous and stable trajectories. Furthermore, to enhance driving safety and reduce collisions, we introduce a Diffusion Group Relative Policy Optimization (DiffGRPO) stage, reinforcing the planner for enhanced safety and comfort. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that ReCogDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, qualitative results across diverse driving scenarios and DriveBench highlight the model's scene comprehension. All code, model weights, and datasets will be made publicly available to facilitate subsequent research.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available: https://github.com/j-morano/MIRAGE.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup, and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

Abstract: The content-agnostic, fixed-grid tokenizers used by standard large-scale vision models like Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) represent a fundamental performance bottleneck, creating a trade-off between capturing fine-grained detail and suffering from redundant computation. To resolve this dilemma, we introduce DART, a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer. DART employs learnable region scores and quantile-based partitioning to create content-aware patches of varying sizes, intelligently allocating a higher token density to information-rich regions. The impact of this approach is profound: it unlocks a more intelligent scaling paradigm, where a DART-equipped DeiT-Small (22M parameters) matches the performance of a DeiT-Base (86M) with nearly double the inference speed by efficiently capturing high-resolution details in key regions. Furthermore, the principle of adaptive tokenization proves its generality with clear benefits in dense prediction and spatiotemporal video tasks. We argue that by resolving the tokenizer bottleneck at its source, adaptive tokenization is a key component for building the next generation of more efficient and capable foundation models for multimodal AI, robotics, and content generation. Code is available at https://github.com/HCPLab-SYSU/DART.

Abstract: Counterfactual generation aims to simulate realistic hypothetical outcomes under causal interventions. Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for this task, combining DDIM inversion with conditional generation and classifier-free guidance (CFG). In this work, we identify a key limitation of CFG for counterfactual generation: it prescribes a global guidance scale for all attributes, leading to significant spurious changes in inferred counterfactuals. To mitigate this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic guidance technique that enables attribute-wise control following a causal graph. DCFG is implemented via a simple attribute-split embedding strategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on user-defined attribute groups.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for improvement.

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to process dense video data. We propose a shift from this video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich descriptions and contextual cues contains sufficient information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To demonstrate this, we employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics for spotting actions in soccer matches. Our experiments show that this language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match events coming close to state-of-the-art video-based spotters while using zero video processing compute and similar amount of time to process the entire match.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T), measures, material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts, engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB) patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned, lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2% recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing interpretation.

<title>Improving Black-Box Generative Attacks via Generator Semantic Consistency</title>

Abstract: Transfer attacks optimize on a surrogate and deploy to a black-box target. While iterative optimization attacks in this paradigm are limited by their per-input cost limits efficiency and scalability due to multistep gradient updates for each input, generative attacks alleviate these by producing adversarial examples in a single forward pass at test time. However, current generative attacks still adhere to optimizing surrogate losses (e.g., feature divergence) and overlook the generator's internal dynamics, underexploring how the generator's internal representations shape transferable perturbations. To address this, we enforce semantic consistency by aligning the early generator's intermediate features to an EMA teacher, stabilizing object-aligned representations and improving black-box transfer without inference-time overhead. To ground the mechanism, we quantify semantic stability as the standard deviation of foreground IoU between cluster-derived activation masks and foreground masks across generator blocks, and observe reduced semantic drift under our method. For more reliable evaluation, we also introduce Accidental Correction Rate (ACR) to separate inadvertent corrections from intended misclassifications, complementing the inherent blind spots in traditional Attack Success Rate (ASR), Fooling Rate (FR), and Accuracy metrics. Across architectures, domains, and tasks, our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing generative attacks with consistent improvements in black-box transfer, while maintaining test-time efficiency.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks, including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code, datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this field.

<title>Light of Normals: Unified Feature Representation for Universal Photometric Stereo</title>

Abstract: Universal photometric stereo (PS) is defined by two factors: it must (i) operate under arbitrary, unknown lighting conditions and (ii) avoid reliance on specific illumination models. Despite progress (e.g., SDM UniPS), two challenges remain. First, current encoders cannot guarantee that illumination and normal information are decoupled. To enforce decoupling, we introduce LINO UniPS with two key components: (i) Light Register Tokens with light alignment supervision to aggregate point, direction, and environment lights; (ii) Interleaved Attention Block featuring global cross-image attention that takes all lighting conditions together so the encoder can factor out lighting while retaining normal-related evidence. Second, high-frequency geometric details are easily lost. We address this with (i) a Wavelet-based Dual-branch Architecture and (ii) a Normal-gradient Perception Loss. These techniques yield a unified feature space in which lighting is explicitly represented by register tokens, while normal details are preserved via wavelet branch. We further introduce PS-Verse, a large-scale synthetic dataset graded by geometric complexity and lighting diversity, and adopt curriculum training from simple to complex scenes. Extensive experiments show new state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks (e.g., DiLiGenT, Luces), stronger generalization to real materials, and improved efficiency; ablations confirm that Light Register Tokens + Interleaved Attention Block drive better feature decoupling, while Wavelet-based Dual-branch Architecture + Normal-gradient Perception Loss recover finer details.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems presents significant potential for smart applications. However, its training and development are hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of edge systems. While transferring pre-trained models to different sensing applications is promising, existing methods often require extensive sensor data and computational resources, resulting in high costs and poor adaptability in practice. In this paper, we propose XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method enabling modality-agnostic, few-shot model transfer with resource-efficient design. XTransfer flexibly uses single or multiple pre-trained models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model repairing that safely mitigates modality shift by adapting pre-trained layers with only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection, model training, and edge deployment.

<title>Controllable Reference Guided Diffusion with Local Global Fusion for Real World Remote Sensing Image Super Resolution</title>

Abstract: Super resolution techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote sensing images, enabling more efficient large scale earth observation applications. While single image SR methods enhance low resolution images, they neglect valuable complementary information from auxiliary data. Reference based SR can be interpreted as an information fusion task, where historical high resolution reference images are combined with current LR observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real world complexities, such as cross sensor resolution gap and significant land cover changes, often leading to under generation or over reliance on reference image. To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable reference guided diffusion model for real world remote sensing image SR. To address the under generation problem, CRefDiff leverages a powerful generative prior to produce accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over reliance on the reference, we introduce a dual branch fusion mechanism that adaptively fuse both local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, the dual branch design enables reference strength control during inference, enhancing the models interactivity and flexibility. Finally, the Better Start strategy is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we introduce RealRefRSSRD, a new real world RefSR dataset for remote sensing images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel2 image pairs with diverse land cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on RealRefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves SOTA performance and improves downstream tasks.

<title>Representation Entanglement for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Much Easier Than You Think</title>

Abstract: REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models, through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\% increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively, SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer).

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution (OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA), designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt (i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/0xFAFA/FA.

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world environments. Existing 2D and 3D physical attacks, due to their focus on texture optimization, often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates complex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21\% to 7.38\%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds remains a challenging task, particularly when data is captured using low-quality scanning devices. These point clouds often contain substantial noise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations, allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy inputs.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and view synthesis are foundational problems in computer vision, graphics, and immersive technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and digital twins. Traditional methods rely on computationally intensive iterative optimization in a complex chain, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in feed-forward approaches, driven by deep learning, have revolutionized this field by enabling fast and generalizable 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. This survey offers a comprehensive review of feed-forward techniques for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, with a taxonomy according to the underlying representation architectures including point cloud, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), etc. We examine key tasks such as pose-free reconstruction, dynamic 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image and video synthesis, highlighting their applications in digital humans, SLAM, robotics, and beyond. In addition, we review commonly used datasets with detailed statistics, along with evaluation protocols for various downstream tasks. We conclude by discussing open research challenges and promising directions for future work, emphasizing the potential of feed-forward approaches to advance the state of the art in 3D vision.

Abstract: Modern camera pipelines apply extensive on-device processing, such as exposure adjustment, white balance, and color correction, which, while beneficial individually, often introduce photometric inconsistencies across views. These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene-specific representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to address this issue, but with increased computational complexity and slower training. In this work, we propose a generalizable, feed-forward approach that predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations in a multi-view consistent manner. Our model processes hundreds of frames in a single step, enabling efficient large-scale harmonization, and seamlessly integrates into downstream 3D reconstruction models, providing cross-scene generalization without requiring scene-specific retraining. To overcome the lack of paired data, we employ a hybrid self-supervised rendering loss leveraging 3D foundation models, improving generalization to real-world variations. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms or matches the reconstruction quality of existing scene-specific optimization methods with appearance modeling, without significantly affecting the training time of baseline 3D models.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework (CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization. Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Muscape/S2R-COD.

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval, especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood, introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors.

We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy, calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement uncertainty.

Abstract: In AI-generated image detection, current cutting-edge methods typically adapt pre-trained foundation models through partial-parameter fine-tuning. However, these approaches often struggle to generalize to forgeries from unseen generators, as the fine-tuned models capture only limited patterns from training data and fail to reflect the evolving traits of new ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), a novel paradigm that dynamically adjusts the prompts fed into the encoder according to each input image, rather than fixing them after training. This design significantly enhances robustness and adaptability to diverse forged images. The dynamic prompts integrate conditional information with test-time adaptive tokens through a lightweight gated mechanism. The conditional information is produced by a Conditional Information Learner, which leverages CNN-based feature extractors to model both forgery-specific and image-specific conditions. The test-time adaptive tokens are optimized during inference on a single sample by enforcing prediction consistency across multiple views, ensuring that the parameters align with the current image. For the final decision, the cropped view with the highest prediction confidence is selected. Extensive experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with mean accuracies of 95.61% and 96.7% on the widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage datasets, respectively. Codes and weights will be released on https://github.com/liyih/IAPL.

Abstract: The advancements of technology have led to the use of multimodal systems in various real-world applications. Among them, audio-visual systems are among the most widely used multimodal systems. In the recent years, associating face and voice of a person has gained attention due to the presence of unique correlation between them. The Face-voice Association in Multilingual Environments (FAME) 2026 Challenge focuses on exploring face-voice association under the unique condition of a multilingual scenario. This condition is inspired from the fact that half of the world's population is bilingual and most often people communicate under multilingual scenarios. The challenge uses a dataset named Multilingual Audio-Visual (MAV-Celeb) for exploring face-voice association in multilingual environments. This report provides the details of the challenge, dataset, baseline models, and task details for the FAME Challenge.

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a parameter-efficient adaptation of one of the foundational pre-trained vision encoders. The proposed method, GenD, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters (0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical feature manifold using L2 normalization and metric learning on it.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 14 benchmark datasets spanning from 2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC. Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older, diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method, proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted, minimal changes to a pre-trained foundational image encoder model. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Creating ultra-high-resolution spatially varying bidirectional reflectance functions (SVBRDFs) is critical for photorealistic 3D content creation, to faithfully represent fine-scale surface details required for close-up rendering. However, achieving 4K generation faces two key challenges: (1) the need to synthesize multiple reflectance maps at full resolution, which multiplies the pixel budget and imposes prohibitive memory and computational cost, and (2) the requirement to maintain strong pixel-level alignment across maps at 4K, which is particularly difficult when adapting pretrained models designed for the RGB image domain. We introduce HiMat, a diffusion-based framework tailored for efficient and diverse 4K SVBRDF generation. To address the first challenge, HiMat performs generation in a high-compression latent space via DC-AE, and employs a pretrained diffusion transformer with linear attention to improve per-map efficiency. To address the second challenge, we propose CrossStitch, a lightweight convolutional module that enforces cross-map consistency without incurring the cost of global attention. Our experiments show that HiMat achieves high-fidelity 4K SVBRDF generation with superior efficiency, structural consistency, and diversity compared to prior methods. Beyond materials, our framework also generalizes to related applications such as intrinsic decomposition.

<title>Bridging Semantic Logic Gaps: A Cognition Inspired Multimodal Boundary Preserving Network for Image Manipulation Localization</title>

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition inspired multimodal boundary preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information. We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally, inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder (RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models. Our code is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/CMB-Net.

Abstract: Power batteries are essential components in electric vehicles, where internal structural defects can pose serious safety risks. We conduct a comprehensive study on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the dense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for quality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while traditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low contrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and drive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first large-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine battery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world visual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an intelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted pre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate PBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed to extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point, line, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination between plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state space modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive relationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware reordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density. In addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide robust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode positions. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at \href{https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/X-ray-PBD}{PBD5K}.

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and auditory inputs to build and update episodic and semantic memories, gradually accumulating world knowledge. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal manner, enabling deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment. Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn reasoning and retrieves relevant memories to complete tasks. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal agents, we develop M3-Bench, a long-video question answering benchmark comprising 100 newly recorded robot-perspective videos (M3-Bench-robot) and 920 diverse web-sourced videos (M3-Bench-web). We annotate QA pairs designed to test capabilities essential for agent applications, such as person understanding, general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances multimodal agents toward more human-like long-term memory and provides insights for their practical design.

<title>BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation</title>

arXiv:2508.10774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm, built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step and features fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B, and our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information. Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution. This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including 3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input modalities.

Abstract: Despite the impressive progress on understanding and generating images shown by the recent unified architectures, the integration of 3D tasks remains challenging and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce UniUGG, the first unified understanding and generation framework for 3D modalities. Our unified framework employs an LLM to comprehend and decode sentences and 3D representations. At its core, we propose a spatial decoder leveraging a latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D representations. This allows for the generation and imagination of 3D scenes based on a reference image and an arbitrary view transformation, while remaining supports for spatial visual question answering (VQA) tasks. Additionally, we propose a geometric-semantic learning strategy to pretrain the vision encoder. This design jointly captures the input's semantic and geometric cues, enhancing both spatial understanding and generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in visual representation, spatial understanding, and 3D generation. The source code will be released upon paper acceptance.

<title>Temporal Grounding as a Learning Signal for Referring Video Object Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment and track objects in videos based on natural language expressions, requiring precise alignment between visual content and textual queries. However, existing methods often suffer from semantic misalignment, largely due to indiscriminate frame sampling and supervision of all visible objects during training--regardless of their actual relevance to the expression. We identify the core problem as the absence of an explicit temporal learning signal in conventional training paradigms. To address this, we introduce MeViS-M, a dataset built upon the challenging MeViS benchmark, where we manually annotate temporal spans when each object is referred to by the expression. These annotations provide a direct, semantically grounded supervision signal that was previously missing. To leverage this signal, we propose Temporally Grounded Learning (TGL), a novel learning framework that directly incorporates temporal grounding into the training process. Within this frame- work, we introduce two key strategies. First, Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP) improves both grounding and tracking by decoupling language-guided segmentation for relevant moments from language-agnostic propagation for others. Second, Object-level Selective Supervision (OSS) supervises only the objects temporally aligned with the expression in each training clip, thereby reducing semantic noise and reinforcing language-conditioned learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TGL framework effectively leverages temporal signal to establish a new state-of-the-art on the challenging MeViS benchmark. We will make our code and the MeViS-M dataset publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/wzy1111111/SSD.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained, controllable content generation. Although recent generative models have shown remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at https://github.com/SaraGhazanfari/SpotEdit.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative AI has transformed content creation, communication, and human development. However, this technology raises profound concerns in high-stakes domains, demanding rigorous methods to analyze and evaluate AI-generated content. While existing analytic methods often treat images as indivisible wholes, real-world AI failures generally manifest as specific visual patterns that can evade holistic detection and suit more granular and decomposed analysis. Here we introduce a content analysis tool, Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE), which decompose images into interpretable visual patterns with natural language descriptions. Utilizing interpretability modules and large multimodal models, LanSE can automatically identify visual patterns within data modalities. Our method discovers more than 5,000 visual patterns with 93\% human agreement, provides decomposed evaluation outperforming existing methods, establishes the first systematic evaluation of physical plausibility, and extends to medical imaging settings. Our method's capability to extract language-grounded patterns can be naturally adapted to numerous fields, including biology and geography, as well as other data modalities such as protein structures and time series, thereby advancing content analysis for generative AI.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection has traditionally been approached with task-specific models, sometimes augmented by early vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. With the rise of large, generative VLMs, however, a natural question emerges: can standalone VLMs effectively perform HOI detection, and how do they compare to specialized HOI methods? Addressing this requires a benchmarking dataset and protocol that support both paradigms. Existing benchmarks such as HICO-DET were developed before modern VLMs and rely on exact label matching. This clashes with generative outputs, which may yield multiple equally valid interpretations. For example, in a single image, a person mid-motion with a frisbee might plausibly be described as 'throwing' or 'catching', yet only one is annotated as correct. Such rigid evaluation penalizes valid predictions from both VLMs and HOI-specific methods, but disproportionately underestimates VLM performance because their outputs are less constrained. We introduce a new benchmarking dataset that reformulates HOI detection as a multiple-answer multiple-choice task. It emphasizes challenging scenarios by (i) including a higher proportion of multi-person scenes where individuals perform different interactions, (ii) removing overly simple cases, and (iii) curating hard negative choices. This makes the benchmark more challenging than prior HOI datasets, while still supporting systematic evaluation of both standalone VLMs and HOI-specific methods under a unified protocol. Our results show that large VLMs already surpass state-of-the-art HOI-specific methods across most metrics, while analysis further uncovers key limitations: VLMs often misattribute surrounding people's interactions to the target person and struggle in complex multi-person or occluded scenarios.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on fine-grained datasets.

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos with cross-identity attribute transfer from one or more reference images to a target portrait. Training such models typically requires attribute pairs of the same individual, which are rarely available at scale. To address this challenge, we propose a self-reconstruction formulation that leverages ordinary portrait videos to learn attribute transfer without explicit paired data. Two frames from the same video act as a pseudo pair: one serves as an attribute reference and the other as an identity reference. To enable this self-reconstruction training, we introduce a Dual ReferenceNet that processes the two references separately and then fuses their features via spatial attention within a diffusion model. To make sure each reference functions as a specialized stream for either identity or attribute information, we apply complementary masking to the reference images. Together, these two components guide the model to reconstruct the original video, naturally learning cross-identity attribute transfer. To bridge the gap between self-reconstruction training and cross-identity inference, we introduce a mask expansion strategy and augmentation schemes, enabling robust transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent and misalignment. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer. Moreover, its dual reference design uniquely supports multi-attribute composition and smooth attribute interpolation within a single generation pass, enabling highly flexible and controllable synthesis.

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However, those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors (e.g., normal vector), and they might also be unreliably estimated by noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis, showing that our framework, GeoSplat, significantly improves the performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-resolution motion information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. However, the delicate events are highly susceptible to noise. Although noise can be reduced by raising the threshold of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), this inevitably causes under-reporting of events. Most existing event-guided deblurring methods overlook this practical trade-off, and the indiscriminate feature extraction and naive fusion result in unstable and mixed representations and ultimately unsatisfactory performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that mimics various DVS thresholds, exposing RED to diverse under-reporting patterns and thereby fostering robustness under unknown conditions. With an adaption to RPS, a Modality-specific Representation Mechanism (MRM) is designed to explicitly model semantic understanding, motion priors, and cross-modality correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two interactive modules are presented to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry images and inject semantic context into under-reporting event representations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information. The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of 2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Abstract: Recent progress in aligning image and video generative models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has improved human preference alignment, but existing variants remain inefficient due to sequential rollouts and large numbers of sampling steps, unreliable credit assignment: sparse terminal rewards are uniformly propagated across timesteps, failing to capture the varying criticality of decisions during denoising. In this paper, we present BranchGRPO, a method that restructures the rollout process into a branching tree, where shared prefixes amortize computation and pruning removes low-value paths and redundant depths. BranchGRPO introduces three contributions: (1) a branching scheme that amortizes rollout cost through shared prefixes while preserving exploration diversity; (2) a reward fusion and depth-wise advantage estimator that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense step-level signals; and (3) pruning strategies that cut gradient computation but leave forward rollouts and exploration unaffected. On HPDv2.1 image alignment, BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by up to \textbf{16\%} over DanceGRPO, while reducing per-iteration training time by nearly \textbf{55\%}. A hybrid variant, BranchGRPO-Mix, further accelerates training to 4.7x faster than DanceGRPO without degrading alignment. On WanX video generation, it further achieves higher Video-Align scores with sharper and temporally consistent frames compared to DanceGRPO.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94 precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset. Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50) performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation for clinical translation

Abstract: Multispectral object detection is an important application for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, it faces several challenges. First, low-light RGB images weaken the multispectral fusion due to details loss. Second, the interference information is introduced to local target modeling during multispectral fusion. Third, computational cost poses deployment challenge on UAV platforms, such as transformer-based methods with quadratic complexity. To address these issues, a framework named DEPFusion consisting of two designed modules, Dual-Domain Enhancement (DDE) and Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion (PGMF) , is proposed for UAV multispectral object detection. Firstly, considering the adoption of low-frequency component for global brightness enhancement and frequency spectra features for texture-details recovery, DDE module is designed with Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba (CSWM) block and Fourier Details Recovery (FDR) block. Secondly, considering guiding the scanning of Mamba from high priority score tokens, which contain local target feature, a novel Priority-Guided Serialization is proposed with theoretical proof. Based on it, PGMF module is designed for multispectral feature fusion, which enhance local modeling and reduce interference information. Experiments on DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets demonstrate that DEPFusion achieves good performance with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains, this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various image attributes are encoded into the user-specified feature. Our decoder is implemented as a guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature. One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into these DNNs' feature spaces.

Abstract: We propose an accurate and interpretable fine-grained cross-view localization method that estimates the 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose of a ground-level image by matching its local features with a reference aerial image. Unlike prior approaches that rely on global descriptors or bird's-eye-view (BEV) transformations, our method directly learns ground-aerial image-plane correspondences using weak supervision from camera poses. The matched ground points are lifted into BEV space with monocular depth predictions, and scale-aware Procrustes alignment is then applied to estimate camera rotation, translation, and optionally the scale between relative depth and the aerial metric space. This formulation is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and requires no pixel-level annotations. Experiments show state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging scenarios such as cross-area testing and unknown orientation. Furthermore, our method offers strong interpretability: correspondence quality directly reflects localization accuracy and enables outlier rejection via RANSAC, while overlaying the re-scaled ground layout on the aerial image provides an intuitive visual cue of localization accuracy.

Abstract: Recovering 3D face models from 2D in-the-wild images has gained considerable attention in the computer vision community due to its wide range of potential applications. However, the lack of ground-truth labeled datasets and the complexity of real-world environments remain significant challenges. In this chapter, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach, the Hierarchical Multi-Level Attention Network (MLANet), for reconstructing 3D face models from single in-the-wild images. Our model predicts detailed facial geometry, texture, pose, and illumination parameters from a single image. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained hierarchical backbone network and introduce multi-level attention mechanisms at different stages of 2D face image feature extraction. A semi-supervised training strategy is employed, incorporating 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from publicly available datasets along with a differentiable renderer, enabling an end-to-end training process. Extensive experiments, including both comparative and ablation studies, were conducted on two benchmark datasets, AFLW2000-3D and MICC Florence, focusing on 3D face reconstruction and 3D face alignment tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large language model (MLLMs) trained on Ascend NPUs. The training of state-of-the-art MLLMs is often confined to a limited set of hardware platforms and relies heavily on massive, undisclosed data recipes, which hinders reproducibility and open research. To change the common perception that Ascend hardware is unsuitable for efficient full-stage MLLM training, we introduce MindSpeed-MLLM, a highly efficient training framework that supports stable and high-performance training of large-scale Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on Ascend hardware. Based on this, we provide a systematic and open description of the data production methods and mixing strategies for all training stages. Furthermore, we present MindVL, a data-efficient multimodal large language model trained end-to-end on Ascend NPUs. In addition, we find that averaging weights from checkpoints trained with different sequence lengths is particularly effective and yields further gains when combined with test-time resolution search. Our experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency: MindVL-8B matches the performance of Qwen2.5VL-7B using only 10\% of its training data, while our MoE model, MindVL-671B-A37B, matches Qwen2.5VL-72B using only 3\% of the Qwen2.5VL training data, and achieves comparable performance with other leading multimodal MoE models. Our work provides the community with a valuable hardware alternative, open data recipes, and effective performance-enhancing techniques.

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities. However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient inference in HR-LVLMs.

Abstract: Pelvic fractures pose significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in cases where fracture signs are subtle or invisible on standard radiographs. To address this, we introduce PelFANet, a dual-stream attention network that fuses raw pelvic X-rays with segmented bone images to improve fracture classification. The network employs Fused Attention Blocks (FABlocks) to iteratively exchange and refine features from both inputs, capturing global context and localized anatomical detail. Trained in a two-stage pipeline with a segmentation-guided approach, PelFANet demonstrates superior performance over conventional methods. On the AMERI dataset, it achieves 88.68% accuracy and 0.9334 AUC on visible fractures, while generalizing effectively to invisible fracture cases with 82.29% accuracy and 0.8688 AUC, despite not being trained on them. These results highlight the clinical potential of anatomy-aware dual-input architectures for robust fracture detection, especially in scenarios with subtle radiographic presentations.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding. Code is available at https://github.com/KangJialiang/ViSpec.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated strong multimodal understanding, yet their fine-grained visual perception is often constrained by low input resolutions. A common remedy is to partition high-resolution images into multiple sub-images for separate encoding, but this approach drastically inflates the number of visual tokens and introduces prohibitive inference overhead. To overcome this challenge, we propose Pyramid Token Pruning (PTP), a training-free strategy that hierarchically integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and token levels with top-down instruction-guided relevance. Inspired by human visual cognition, PTP selectively preserves more tokens from salient regions while further emphasizing those most relevant to task instructions. Extensive experiments on 13 diverse benchmarks show that PTP substantially reduces computational cost, memory usage, and inference latency, with negligible performance degradation.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges associated with merging low-rank adaptations of large neural networks. With the rise of parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), model fine-tuning has become more accessible. While fine-tuning models with LoRA is highly efficient, existing merging methods often sacrifice this efficiency by merging fully-sized weight matrices. We propose the Core Space merging framework, which enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis, thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while utilizing a fraction of the computational resources.

Abstract: Neural fields have emerged as a powerful representation for 3D geometry, enabling compact and continuous modeling of complex shapes. Despite their expressive power, manipulating neural fields in a controlled and accurate manner -- particularly under spatial constraints -- remains an open challenge, as existing approaches struggle to balance surface quality, robustness, and efficiency. We address this by introducing a novel method for handle-guided neural field deformation, which leverages discrete local surface representations to optimize the As-Rigid-As-Possible deformation energy. To this end, we propose the local patch mesh representation, which discretizes level sets of a neural signed distance field by projecting and deforming flat mesh patches guided solely by the SDF and its gradient. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation showing that our method consistently outperforms baselines in deformation quality, robustness, and computational efficiency. We also present experiments that motivate our choice of discretization over marching cubes. By bridging classical geometry processing and neural representations through local patch meshing, our work enables scalable, high-quality deformation of neural fields and paves the way for extending other geometric tasks to neural domains.

Abstract: Combining the message-passing paradigm with the global attention mechanism has emerged as an effective framework for learning over graphs. The message-passing paradigm and the global attention mechanism fundamentally generate node embeddings based on information aggregated from a node's local neighborhood or from the whole graph. The most basic and commonly used aggregation approach is to take the sum of information from a node's local neighbourhood or from the whole graph. However, it is unknown if the dominant information is from a node itself or from the node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes). Therefore, there exists information lost at each layer of embedding generation, and this information lost could be accumulated and become more serious when more layers are used in the model. In this paper, we present a differential encoding method to address the issue of information lost. The idea of our method is to encode the differential representation between the information from a node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes) and that from the node itself. The obtained differential encoding is then combined with the original aggregated local or global representation to generate the updated node embedding. By integrating differential encodings, the representational ability of generated node embeddings is improved. The differential encoding method is empirically evaluated on different graph tasks on seven benchmark datasets. The results show that it is a general method that improves the message-passing update and the global attention update, advancing the state-of-the-art performance for graph representation learning on these datasets.

Abstract: Sleep stages play an important role in identifying sleep patterns and diagnosing sleep disorders. In this study, we present an automated sleep stage classifier called the Attentive Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (AttDiCNN), which uses deep learning methodologies to address challenges related to data heterogeneity, computational complexity, and reliable and automatic sleep staging. We employed a force-directed layout based on the visibility graph to capture the most significant information from the EEG signals, thereby representing the spatial-temporal features. The proposed network consists of three modules: the Localized Spatial Feature Extraction Network (LSFE), Spatio-Temporal-Temporal Long Retention Network (S2TLR), and Global Averaging Attention Network (G2A). The LSFE captures spatial information from sleep data, the S2TLR is designed to extract the most pertinent information in long-term contexts, and the G2A reduces computational overhead by aggregating information from the LSFE and S2TLR. We evaluated the performance of our model on three comprehensive and publicly accessible datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.56%, 99.66%, and 99.08% for the EDFX, HMC, and NCH datasets, respectively, while maintaining a low computational complexity with 1.4 M parameters. Our proposed architecture surpasses existing methodologies in several performance metrics, thereby proving its potential as an automated tool for clinical settings.

Abstract: Supervised contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success by leveraging label information; however, determining positive samples in multi-label scenarios remains a critical challenge. In multi-label supervised contrastive learning (MSCL), multi-label relations are not yet fully defined, leading to ambiguity in identifying positive samples and formulating contrastive loss functions to construct the representation space. To address these challenges, we: (i) systematically formulate multi-label relations in MSCL, (ii) propose a novel Similarity-Dissimilarity Loss, which dynamically re-weights samples based on similarity and dissimilarity factors, (iii) further provide theoretical grounded proofs for our method through rigorous mathematical analysis that supports the formulation and effectiveness, and (iv) offer a unified form and paradigm for both single-label and multi-label supervised contrastive loss. We conduct experiments on both image and text modalities and further extend the evaluation to the medical domain. The results show that our method consistently outperforms baselines in comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-III-Full.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and deep learning are increasingly applied in the clinical domain, particularly for early and accurate disease detection using medical imaging and sound. Due to limited trained personnel, there is a growing demand for automated tools to support clinicians in managing rising patient loads. Respiratory diseases such as cancer and diabetes remain major global health concerns requiring timely diagnosis and intervention. Auscultation of lung sounds, combined with chest X-rays, is an established diagnostic method for respiratory illness. This study presents a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for the analysis of respiratory sound data to detect Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Acoustic features extracted with the Librosa library, including Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Mel-Spectrogram, Chroma, Chroma (Constant Q), and Chroma CENS, were used in training. The system also classifies disease severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Evaluation on the ICBHI database achieved 96% accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation and 90% accuracy without cross-validation. The proposed network outperforms existing methods, demonstrating potential as a practical tool for clinical deployment.

Methods: We introduce Freqformer, a novel Transformer-based model featuring a dual-branch architecture that integrates a Transformer layer for capturing global spatial context with a complex-valued frequency-domain module designed for adaptive frequency enhancement. Freqformer was trained using single depth-plane OCTA images, utilizing volumetrically merged OCTA as the ground truth. Performance was evaluated quantitatively through 2-D and 3-D image quality metrics. 2-D networks and their 3-D counterparts were compared to assess the differences between enhancing volume slice by slice and enhancing it by 3-D patches. Furthermore, 3-D quantitative vascular metrics were conducted to quantify human retinal vasculature. Results: Freqformer substantially outperformed existing convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based methods, achieving superior image metrics. Importantly, the enhanced OCTA volumes show strong correlation with the merged volumes on vascular segment count, density, length, and flow index, further underscoring its reliability for quantitative vascular analysis. 3-D counterparts did not yield additional gains in image metrics or downstream 3-D vascular quantification but incurred nearly an order-of-magnitude longer inference time, supporting our 2-D slice-wise enhancement strategy. Additionally, Freqformer showed excellent generalization capability on larger field-of-view scans, surpassing the quality of conventional volumetric merging methods. Conclusion: Freqformer reliably generates high-definition 3-D retinal microvasculature from single-scan OCTA, enabling precise vascular quantification comparable to standard volumetric merging methods.

Abstract: A novel onboard tracking approach enabling vision-based relative localization and communication using Active blinking Marker Tracking (AMT) is introduced in this article. Active blinking markers on multi-robot team members improve the robustness of relative localization for aerial vehicles in tightly coupled multi-robot systems during real-world deployments, while also serving as a resilient communication system. Traditional tracking algorithms struggle with fast-moving blinking markers due to their intermittent appearance in camera frames and the complexity of associating multiple of these markers across consecutive frames. AMT addresses this by using weighted polynomial regression to predict the future appearance of active blinking markers while accounting for uncertainty in the prediction. In outdoor experiments, the AMT approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in tracking density, accuracy, and complexity. The experimental validation of this novel tracking approach for relative localization and optical communication involved testing motion patterns motivated by our research on agile multi-robot deployment.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in traditional syntactic communications based on Shannon's theory, these methods struggle to meet the requirements of 6G immersive communications, especially under challenging transmission conditions. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), progress has been made in reconstructing videos using high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose a scalable generative video semantic communication framework that extracts and transmits semantic information to achieve high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, at the transmitter, description and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are extracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics, respectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are utilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing the video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel bandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to reconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different signal-to-noise ratios. Notably, the proposed ``First Frame+Desc." scheme consistently achieves CLIP score exceeding 0.92 at CBR = 0.0057 for SNR > 0 dB. This demonstrates its robust performance even under low SNR conditions.

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation is a challenging task as it requires strict adherence to genre-specific choreography while ensuring physically realistic and precisely synchronized dance sequences with the music's beats and rhythm. Although significant progress has been made in music-conditioned dance generation, most existing methods struggle to convey specific stylistic attributes in generated dance. To bridge this gap, we propose a diffusion-based framework for genre-specific 3D full-body dance generation, conditioned on both music and descriptive text. To effectively incorporate genre information, we develop a text-based control mechanism that maps input prompts, either explicit genre labels or free-form descriptive text, into genre-specific control signals, enabling precise and controllable text-guided generation of genre-consistent dance motions. Furthermore, to enhance the alignment between music and textual conditions, we leverage the features of a music foundation model, facilitating coherent and semantically aligned dance synthesis. Last, to balance the objectives of extracting text-genre information and maintaining high-quality generation results, we propose a novel multi-task optimization strategy. This effectively balances competing factors such as physical realism, spatial accuracy, and text classification, significantly improving the overall quality of the generated sequences. Extensive experimental results obtained on the FineDance and AIST++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of GCDance over the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Most existing learning-based methods for solving imaging inverse problems can be roughly divided into two classes: iterative algorithms, such as plug-and-play and diffusion methods leveraging pretrained denoisers, and unrolled architectures that are trained end-to-end for specific imaging problems. Iterative methods in the first class are computationally costly and often yield suboptimal reconstruction performance, whereas unrolled architectures are generally problem-specific and require expensive training. In this work, we propose a novel non-iterative, lightweight architecture that incorporates knowledge about the forward operator (acquisition physics and noise parameters) without relying on unrolling. Our model is trained to solve a wide range of inverse problems, such as deblurring, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, inpainting, and super-resolution, and handles arbitrary image sizes and channels, such as grayscale, complex, and color data. The proposed model can be easily adapted to unseen inverse problems or datasets with a few fine-tuning steps (up to a few images) in a self-supervised way, without ground-truth references. Throughout a series of experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance from medical imaging to low-photon imaging and microscopy. Our code is available at https://github.com/matthieutrs/ram.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for unifying independently fine-tuned models into an integrated framework, significantly enhancing computational efficiency in multi-task learning. Recently, several SVD-based techniques have been introduced to exploit low-rank structures for enhanced merging, but their reliance on such manually designed rank selection often leads to cross-task interference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose AdaRank, a novel model merging framework that adaptively selects the most beneficial singular directions of task vectors to merge multiple models. We empirically show that the dominant singular components of task vectors can cause critical interference with other tasks, and that naive truncation across tasks and layers degrades performance. In contrast, AdaRank dynamically prunes the singular components that cause interference and offers an optimal amount of information to each task vector by learning to prune ranks during test-time via entropy minimization. Our analysis demonstrates that such method mitigates detrimental overlaps among tasks, while empirical results show that AdaRank consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with various backbones and number of tasks, reducing the performance gap between fine-tuned models to nearly 1%.

<title>In-2-4D: Inbetweening from Two Single-View Images to 4D Generation</title>

Abstract: We pose a new problem, In-2-4D, for generative 4D (i.e., 3D + motion) inbetweening to interpolate two single-view images. In contrast to video/4D generation from only text or a single image, our interpolative task can leverage more precise motion control to better constrain the generation. Given two monocular RGB images representing the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to generate and reconstruct the motion in 4D, without making assumptions on the object category, motion type, length, or complexity. To handle such arbitrary and diverse motions, we utilize a foundational video interpolation model for motion prediction. However, large frame-to-frame motion gaps can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To this end, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states while exhibiting significant motions, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct a 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic 3DGS through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine the 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions. Through extensive qualitative and quantitive experiments as well as a user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and design choices.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve high performance across many domains but can still face challenges in generalization when optimization is influenced by small or noisy gradient components. Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.

Abstract: We present a deep learning model for high-resolution probabilistic precipitation forecasting over an 8-hour horizon in Europe, overcoming the limitations of radar-only deep learning models with short forecast lead times. Our model efficiently integrates multiple data sources - including radar, satellite, and physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) - while capturing long-range interactions, resulting in accurate forecasts with robust uncertainty quantification through consistent probabilistic maps. Featuring a compact architecture, it enables more efficient training and faster inference than existing models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses current operational NWP systems, extrapolation-based methods, and deep-learning nowcasting models, setting a new standard for high-resolution precipitation forecasting in Europe, ensuring a balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual representations for these "vision-first" tasks, as a supplementary channel to language-based reasoning. In this paradigm, planning is executed via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models, leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a viable and promising supplement to language-based reasoning, opening new avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.

Abstract: Continual model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models sequentially without access to the original training data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning. However, existing methods face two critical challenges: parameter interference among tasks, which leads to catastrophic forgetting, and limited adaptability to evolving test distributions. To address these issues, we introduce the task of Test-Time Continual Model Merging (TTCMM), which leverages a small set of unlabeled test samples during inference to alleviate parameter conflicts and handle distribution shifts. We propose MINGLE, a novel framework for TTCMM. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture with parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, which enhances adaptability to evolving test distributions while dynamically merging models to mitigate conflicts. To further reduce forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations, thereby suppressing activations on old tasks and preserving past knowledge. We further introduce an Adaptive Relaxation Strategy that adjusts constraint strength dynamically based on interference signals observed during test-time adaptation, striking a balance between stability and adaptability. Extensive experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE achieves robust generalization, significantly reduces forgetting, and consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9\% on average across diverse task orders.

<title>Scaling Diffusion Transformers Efficiently via $\mu$P</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that $\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT, PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their struggle with hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and limited real-world validation hinders accurate perception and robust step-by-step reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, which establishes an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline}, employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and \textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark demonstrate that AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by \textbf{53.91%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54%}, while markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a promising trajectory for developing trustworthy and tool-aware autonomous driving models. Code is available at https://github.com/curryqka/AgentThink.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing task-relevant from irrelevant signals -- particularly in tasks like Visual Question Answering -- which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem -- the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks -- such as image classification or pure text question answering -- where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem, and we further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to finetune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations, and a consistency regularization strategy applying on model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy and multimodal tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a 3D detailizer, a neural model which can instantaneously (in <1s) transform a coarse 3D shape proxy into a high-quality asset with detailed geometry and texture as guided by an input text prompt. Our model is trained using the text prompt, which defines the shape class and characterizes the appearance and fine-grained style of the generated details. The coarse 3D proxy, which can be easily varied and adjusted (e.g., via user editing), provides structure control over the final shape. Importantly, our detailizer is not optimized for a single shape; it is the result of distilling a generative model, so that it can be reused, without retraining, to generate any number of shapes, with varied structures, whose local details all share a consistent style and appearance. Our detailizer training utilizes a pretrained multi-view image diffusion model, with text conditioning, to distill the foundational knowledge therein into our detailizer via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To improve SDS and enable our detailizer architecture to learn generalizable features over complex structures, we train our model in two training stages to generate shapes with increasing structural complexity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method generates shapes of superior quality and details compared to existing text-to-3D models under varied structure control. Our detailizer can refine a coarse shape in less than a second, making it possible to interactively author and adjust 3D shapes. Furthermore, the user-imposed structure control can lead to creative, and hence out-of-distribution, 3D asset generations that are beyond the current capabilities of leading text-to-3D generative models. We demonstrate an interactive 3D modeling workflow our method enables, and its strong generalizability over styles, structures, and object categories.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) memorize a vast amount of prior knowledge from the Internet that helps them on downstream tasks but also may notoriously sway their outputs towards wrong or biased answers. In this work, we test how the knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models (VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g., unable to recognize the 4th stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of 17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo) across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical illusions, to patterned grids. Removing image backgrounds nearly doubles accuracy (21.09 percentage points), revealing that contextual visual cues trigger these biased responses. Further analysis of VLMs' reasoning patterns shows that counting accuracy initially rises with thinking tokens, reaching ~40%, before declining with excessive reasoning. Our work presents an interesting failure mode in VLMs and a human-supervised automated framework for testing VLM biases. Code and data are available at: vlmsarebiased.github.io.

Abstract: Culture is a rich and dynamic domain that evolves across both geography and time. However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation. The former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural understanding but fall short by 10% to human experts, while open VLMs lags further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of only 42%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and creative adaptation.

Abstract: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore, inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions, which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the generalization ability of the model to real-world settings. Our code will be available at https://github.com/neu-autonomy/SPARTA.

<title>ODE-GS: Latent ODEs for Dynamic Scene Extrapolation with 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: We introduce ODE-GS, a novel approach that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to enable future extrapolation of dynamic 3D scenes. Unlike existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods, which rely on time-conditioned deformation networks and are limited to interpolation within a fixed time window, ODE-GS eliminates timestamp dependency by modeling Gaussian parameter trajectories as continuous-time latent dynamics. Our approach first learns an interpolation model to generate accurate Gaussian trajectories within the observed window, then trains a Transformer encoder to aggregate past trajectories into a latent state evolved via a neural ODE. Finally, numerical integration produces smooth, physically plausible future Gaussian trajectories, enabling rendering at arbitrary future timestamps. On the D-NeRF, NVFi, and HyperNeRF benchmarks, ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation performance, improving metrics by 19.8% compared to leading baselines, demonstrating its ability to accurately represent and predict 3D scene dynamics.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models have achieved remarkable progress in integrating vision and language, enabling strong performance across perception, reasoning, and domain-specific tasks. However, their capacity to reason over multiple, visually similar inputs remains insufficiently explored. Such fine-grained comparative reasoning is central to real-world tasks, especially in mathematics and education, where learners must often distinguish between nearly identical diagrams to identify correct solutions. To address this gap, we present VisioMath, a curated benchmark of 1,800 high-quality K-12 mathematics problems in which all candidate answers are diagrams with subtle visual similarities. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LMMs, covering both leading closed-source systems and widely adopted open-source models, reveals a consistent decline in accuracy as inter-image similarity increases. Analysis indicates that the dominant failure mode stems from image-text misalignment: rather than grounding reasoning in textual cues, models often resort to shallow positional heuristics, resulting in systematic errors. We further explore three alignment-oriented strategies, spanning training-free approaches and finetuning, and achieve substantial accuracy gains. We hope that VisioMath will serve as a rigorous benchmark and catalyst for developing LMMs toward deeper diagram understanding, precise comparative reasoning, and grounded multi-image-text integration.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of soft-tissue interactions is fundamental for advancing surgical simulation, surgical robotics, and model-based surgical automation. To achieve real-time latency, classical Finite Element Method (FEM) solvers are often replaced with neural approximations; however, naively training such models in a fully data-driven manner without incorporating physical priors frequently leads to poor generalization and physically implausible predictions. We present a novel physics-informed neural simulation framework that enables real-time prediction of soft-tissue deformations under complex single- and multi-grasper interactions. Our approach integrates Kelvinlet-based analytical priors with large-scale FEM data, capturing both linear and nonlinear tissue responses. This hybrid design improves predictive accuracy and physical plausibility across diverse neural architectures while maintaining the low-latency performance required for interactive applications. We validate our method on challenging surgical manipulation tasks involving standard laparoscopic grasping tools, demonstrating substantial improvements in deformation fidelity and temporal stability over existing baselines. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented learning as a principled and computationally efficient paradigm for real-time, physics-aware soft-tissue simulation in surgical AI.

<title>Meta Pruning via Graph Metanetworks : A Universal Meta Learning Framework for Network Pruning</title>

arXiv:2506.12041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an entirely new meta-learning framework for network pruning. It is a general framework that can be theoretically applied to almost all types of networks with all kinds of pruning and has great generality and transferability. Experiments have shown that it can achieve outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including both CNNs and Transformers). Unlike all prior works that either rely on fixed, hand-crafted criteria to prune in a coarse manner, or employ learning to prune ways that require special training during each pruning and lack generality. Our framework can learn complex pruning rules automatically via a neural network (metanetwork) and has great generality that can prune without any special training. More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically and can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and some standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yewei-Liu/MetaPruning.

<title>Origins of Creativity in Attention-Based Diffusion Models</title>

arXiv:2506.17324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how `creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g., (Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process. However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself (translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise `mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

<title>RAM-W1K: A Multi-Task Wrist Dataset and Benchmark for Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that has been the focus of research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and disease monitoring. In clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis, which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii) Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 1048 wrist conventional radiographs of 388 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level instance segmentation annotations for 618 images and SvdH BE scores for 800 images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte detection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal bone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the barrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within the RA-related domain.

Abstract: Generative models like diffusion and flow-matching create high-fidelity samples by progressively refining noise. The refinement process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function evaluations. We introduce Warm-Start Diffusion (WSD), a method that uses a simple, deterministic model to dramatically accelerate conditional generation by providing a better starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed $N(\boldsymbol{0}, I)$ prior, our deterministic warm-start model predicts an informed prior $N(\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_C, \text{diag}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}^2_C))$, whose moments are conditioned on the input context $C$. This warm start substantially reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, and therefore the number of diffusion steps required, particularly when the context $C$ is strongly informative. WSD is applicable to any standard diffusion or flow matching algorithm, is orthogonal to and synergistic with other fast sampling techniques like efficient solvers, and is simple to implement. We test WSD in a variety of settings, and find that it substantially outperforms standard diffusion in the efficient sampling regime, generating realistic samples using only 4-6 function evaluations, and saturating performance with 10-12.

Abstract: Scaling general-purpose manipulation to new robot embodiments remains challenging: each platform typically needs large, homogeneous demonstrations, and pixel-to-action VLA pipelines typically degenerate under background and viewpoint shifts. In this paper, we present Vidar, a prior-driven, low-shot adaptation paradigm that replaces most embodiment-specific data with transferable video priors. Vidar consists of an embodied video diffusion model as the generalizable prior and a masked inverse dynamics model (MIDM) adapter based on a key decoupling of the policy. The embodied diffusion model is pre-trained on Internet-scale videos and then domain-adapted to 750K multi-view trajectories from three real-world robot platforms using a unified observation space encoding robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. The MIDM module learns action-relevant pixel masks without dense labels, grounding the prior into the target embodiment's action space while suppressing distractors. Crucially, the generative video prior models the distribution of plausible, temporally coherent interactions, implicitly capturing affordances, contact dynamics, and physical consistency from massive unlabeled video. This shifts the challenge from collecting large amounts of new robot data to efficiently aligning a rich prior with a new embodiment. With only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot (1% of typical data), Vidar outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines and generalizes to unseen tasks, backgrounds, and camera layouts. Our results suggest a scalable recipe for "one prior, many embodiments": strong, inexpensive video priors + minimal on-robot alignment.

Abstract: Despite their success, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.

Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models. We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.

Abstract: Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics. Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering, there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate 3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes and semantic manipulations.

Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.

Abstract: Graph alignment, the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across multiple graphs, is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios. Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language representations.

Abstract: Multiview ideals arise from the geometry of image formation in pinhole cameras, and universal multiview ideals are their analogs for unknown cameras. We prove that a natural collection of polynomials form a universal Gr\"obner basis for both types of ideals using a criterion introduced by Huang and Larson, and include a proof of their criterion in our setting. Symmetry reduction and induction enable the method to be deployed on an infinite family of ideals. We also give an explicit description of the matroids on which the methodology depends, in the context of multiview ideals.

Abstract: Reliable global localization is critical for autonomous vehicles, especially in environments where GNSS is degraded or unavailable, such as urban canyons and tunnels. Although high-definition (HD) maps provide accurate priors, the cost of data collection, map construction, and maintenance limits scalability. OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a free and globally available alternative, but its coarse abstraction poses challenges for matching with sensor data. We propose InterKey, a cross-modal framework that leverages road intersections as distinctive landmarks for global localization. Our method constructs compact binary descriptors by jointly encoding road and building imprints from point clouds and OSM. To bridge modality gaps, we introduce discrepancy mitigation, orientation determination, and area-equalized sampling strategies, enabling robust cross-modal matching. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that InterKey achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming recent baselines by a large margin. The framework generalizes to sensors that can produce dense structural point clouds, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for robust vehicle localization.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models show immense potential for spatial intelligence tasks due to their rich world priors, but this is undermined by limited controllability, poor spatial-temporal consistency, and entangled scene-camera dynamics. Existing solutions, such as model fine-tuning and warping-based repainting, struggle with scalability, generalization, and robustness against artifacts. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. 1) Intra-Step Recursive Refinement injects fine-grained trajectory guidance at denoising steps through a recursive correction loop, ensuring motion remains aligned with the target path. 2) Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. 3) Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across various 3D/4D tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in trajectory adherence, geometric consistency, and perceptual quality, outperforming both training-intensive and inference-only baselines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in diverse applications, but the problems of high latency and energy overhead are inevitable on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, most researchers focus on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the latency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of processors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and not fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a significant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing frequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a model-based and data-driven method. Then by combining with the fitting parameters of different DNN models, we give a preliminary analysis for the proposed model to see the effects of adjusting memory frequency and computing frequency simultaneously. Finally, simulation results in local inference and cooperative inference cases further validate the effectiveness of jointly scaling the memory frequency and computing frequency to reduce the energy consumption of devices.

<div> Keywords: flow matching models, reinforcement learning, temporal structure, credit assignment, human preference alignment

Summary:
TempFlow-GRPO introduces a framework for integrating reinforcement learning with flow matching models, addressing the issue of temporal uniformity in existing approaches. It includes a trajectory branching mechanism for precise credit assignment, a noise-aware weighting scheme for optimizing policy according to exploration potential, and a seed group strategy to control for initialization effects. These innovations result in temporally-aware optimization that respects generative dynamics and leads to improved performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks. This framework demonstrates state-of-the-art quality in aligning generated content with human preferences by capturing and exploiting the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation processes. <div>

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces three key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases; and (iii) a seed group strategy that controls for initialization effects to isolate exploration contributions. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset, enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation. Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons, posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using 3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly across different datasets.

<div> Keywords: real-world images, degradation, latent prior inference, spatially-adaptive restoration, efficient decoding module

Summary:
Our work focuses on addressing diverse degradations in real-world images, such as haze, rain, and low-light, which can significantly affect visual quality and downstream vision tasks. We introduce a novel approach that reframes all-in-one restoration (AIR) as learned latent prior inference, allowing for degradation-aware representations to be automatically inferred from the input without explicit task cues. By leveraging these latent priors, we develop a structured reasoning paradigm that determines adaptive feature selection, spatial localization, and degradation semantics for efficient restoration. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various degradation tasks and settings, achieving an average improvement of 1.68 dB in PSNR while being three times more efficient. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in addressing spatially diverse degradations in real-world images.

Abstract: Real-world images often suffer from spatially diverse degradations such as haze, rain, snow, and low-light, significantly impacting visual quality and downstream vision tasks. Existing all-in-one restoration (AIR) approaches either depend on external text prompts or embed hand-crafted architectural priors (e.g., frequency heuristics); both impose discrete, brittle assumptions that weaken generalization to unseen or mixed degradations. To address this limitation, we propose to reframe AIR as learned latent prior inference, where degradation-aware representations are automatically inferred from the input without explicit task cues. Based on latent priors, we formulate AIR as a structured reasoning paradigm: (1) which features to route (adaptive feature selection), (2) where to restore (spatial localization), and (3) what to restore (degradation semantics). We design a lightweight decoding module that efficiently leverages these latent encoded cues for spatially-adaptive restoration. Extensive experiments across six common degradation tasks, five compound settings, and previously unseen degradations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, achieving an average PSNR improvement of 1.68 dB while being three times more efficient.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a model-agnostic framework for improving Radiography Report Generation (RRG) accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional training data.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on improving computer-aided diagnostic support for Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) by analyzing behavioral cues in video data. The researchers analyzed a large, balanced dataset of ASC and non-autistic participants, using facial expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze behavior for multimodal analysis. They introduced novel statistical descriptors to improve gaze-based classification accuracy and align with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. By utilizing late fusion to integrate behavioral markers across modalities, they achieved a classification accuracy of 74%.

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support autism assessment.

Summary: 
KV-Efficient VLA is a memory compression framework that addresses the inefficiencies of Vision-Language-Action models by selectively retaining high-utility context. By partitioning the key-value cache and using a recurrent gating module, the framework filters historical context based on utility scores, leading to up to 1.21x inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction without compromising task success. The method maintains causality and seamlessly integrates into existing VLA models, enabling scalable inference without modifying training pipelines or downstream control logic. <div>
arXiv:2509.21354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training pipelines or downstream control logic.

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images. However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

<br />Summary: 
This study developed a novel multimodal deep learning architecture, MDF-MLLM, to improve disease classification accuracy from retinal fundus images. By integrating fine-grained image features and global textual context, the model achieved a significant accuracy improvement of 94% on a dual-type disease classification task, outperforming traditional MLLM baselines. The MDF-MLLM utilizes skip features from multiple U-Net encoder layers and cross-attention blocks within a large language model for enhanced spatial reasoning and classification. The model showed promising results in diagnosing both acquired and inherited retinal diseases, with recall and F1-scores significantly improved. The study confirms the effectiveness of the multi-depth fusion approach in capturing low-level spatial details critical for accurate disease classification. The architecture's modular and interpretable design suggests potential real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work aims to explore synchronized training techniques, expand the range of diseases for greater generalizability, and extend the model for segmentation tasks. <div>

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%, representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67% and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

Summary:
The article discusses the potential misuse of text-to-image (T2I) models to generate Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content through jailbreak attacks. Existing methods focus on manipulating textual prompts, but fail to address vulnerabilities in image-based inputs. To combat this, the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack (MPDA) is proposed. This attack involves three main steps: decoupling unsafe prompts into safe and harmful components using a large language model (LLM), rewriting harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, and generating image captions to ensure semantic consistency in the generated NSFW images. MPDA leverages the image modality to guide the LLM in refining and iterating the content generation process. This innovative approach enhances the bypassing of safety filters and highlights the importance of considering multimodal inputs in securing T2I models against abuse.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks. Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover, text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps: firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts, the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

Summary:<br /><br />Researchers propose a new method for improving salient object detection by incorporating supervision from foreground contour and edge detection tasks. By intertwining salient object and foreground contour detection, the method generates saliency maps with uniform highlight, addressing issues of incomplete predictions and inaccurate boundaries. Simultaneously guiding foreground contour and edge detection tasks enhances precision and reduces local noise in edge prediction. A novel mutual learning module (MLM) with multiple network branches trained in a mutual learning manner significantly improves performance. Extensive experiments on seven challenging datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results in salient object detection and edge detection. <div>
arXiv:2509.21363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

<div> contrastive learning, multimodal relevance metric, CLIP, MAJORScore, multimodal joint representation  
Summary:  
The article introduces MAJORScore, a novel evaluation metric for assessing the relevance of multiple modalities in large-scale multimodal datasets. While existing metrics are limited to evaluating the correlation between two modalities, MAJORScore is designed to handle N modalities, where N is greater than or equal to three. By leveraging multimodal joint representation, which integrates multiple modalities into the same latent space, MAJORScore provides a more robust and accurate measure of multimodal similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that MAJORScore outperforms existing methods by increasing relevance scores for consistent modalities and decreasing scores for inconsistent ones. This metric can enhance the evaluation of similarity on diverse multimodal datasets and improve multimodal model performance assessments.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP). However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation metric for the relevance of multiple modalities (N modalities, N>=3) via multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by 13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

Summary: 
The construction industry relies on safety assessments to ensure the integrity of assets and protect workers. Scaffolding, a crucial structural support element, requires regular inspection to detect any deviations from design rules that could compromise safety. Current visual inspections conducted by site managers or accredited personnel are time-consuming and prone to errors. This paper proposes using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digitization to improve the accuracy of scaffolding inspections. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process and analyze point cloud data of scaffolding structures, comparing recent data with certified reference data to identify structural modifications. This automated monitoring system could streamline inspections, reducing manual effort and improving safety on construction sites.

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge. Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts, and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

Summary:<br />
- Optical microscopy faces limitations in lateral resolution.
- Specialized techniques or costly modules are typically required for super-resolution.
- The study explores an economical approach using phase-modulated microscopy.
- Two deep neural network architectures, O-Net and Theta-Net, were evaluated for super-resolution.
- Results showed their complementary performance based on image signal-to-noise ratios. 
- O-Net performed better at high SNRs while Theta-Net was preferred at low SNRs.
- Model architecture and image SNR significantly impact super-resolution quality in non-fluorescent optical microscopy.
- The study highlights the importance of considering model architectures in achieving high-quality super-resolved images. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis. Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g. confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution (SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal (non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative & economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously (termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy, even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

<div> Keywords: concept unlearning, text-to-image diffusion models, sparse autoencoder, concept-neuron mappings, supervised training

Summary: 
SAEmnesia is a new method for effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models. It uses supervised sparse autoencoder training to promote precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent space. By systematically labeling concepts, SAEmnesia reduces feature splitting and promotes centralized feature representations. This approach results in specialized neurons with stronger concept associations compared to unsupervised methods. At inference time, SAEmnesia reduces hyperparameter search by 96.67% and achieves a 9.22% improvement on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark. In sequential unlearning tasks, SAEmnesia demonstrates superior scalability, with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object removal.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity (i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network, individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning. We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization. Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object removal.

<div> Keywords: Deep Learning, Healthcare, Biomedical Image Classification, Transfer Learning, Coreset Selection

Summary: 
Deep learning models have significantly impacted healthcare, particularly in the field of biomedical image classification, enabling accurate diagnostics for complex diseases. Two common approaches for training these models are training from scratch and transfer learning, both of which require extensive computational resources. To address the challenges posed by large datasets and hyperparameter optimization, a subset of the dataset known as a coreset is selected for training. Random sampling for coreset selection may lead to biased results, especially in imbalanced datasets. This study proposes a novel method for coreset selection that focuses on capturing intra-class diversity by forming per-class clusters. Experimental results on a biomedical imaging dataset showcase the superior performance of the proposed approach over random sampling in terms of various metrics under uniform conditions. This intelligent coreset selection method shows promise in enhancing the efficiency of deep learning models in biomedical image classification tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset, referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent, lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

Summary:
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model, was developed to improve breast cancer prediction by integrating both current and up to four prior mammograms. The model combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast cancer. It was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based screening dataset with imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. The model consistently improved prediction when prior mammograms were included, outperforming single-visit models. Subgroup analyses confirmed its efficacy in key risk groups, including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. LongiMam also performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density over time, highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information for accurate risk stratification in screening programs. The open-source software for LongiMam is publicly available.

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well, highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information. Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups, including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover, the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as open-source software.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However, these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different object class sensitivities.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel interpretable debugging framework for Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs). The framework consists of two key steps - Removal and Retraining. In the Removal step, experts utilize concept explanations to identify and eliminate undesired concepts. The Retraining step introduces CBDebug, a method that translates concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels, allowing for supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation to minimize the model's reliance on undesired concepts. The framework is evaluated with both real and automated expert feedback and showcases significant improvement over previous retraining methods across various CBM architectures and benchmarks with known spurious correlations. <div>
arXiv:2509.21385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time. However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining. In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation, reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious correlations.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more classical inverse sinkhole detection method.

Summary: 
This study explores the impact of magnitude-based pruning and fine-tuning on neural network interpretability. Using a ResNet-18 model trained on ImageNette, the researchers compared the effects of pruning on low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations. Light-to-moderate pruning was found to improve the focus and faithfulness of saliency maps while maintaining semantically meaningful concepts. However, aggressive pruning led to the merging of heterogeneous features, reducing map sparsity and concept coherence despite preserving model accuracy. The results suggest that pruning can shape internal representations towards more human-aligned attention patterns but excessive pruning can undermine interpretability. It is crucial to strike a balance between model compression and maintaining interpretability in neural network pruning processes.

arXiv:2509.21387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG) across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

<br />Summary: 
The article introduces TUN3D, a novel method for joint layout estimation and 3D object detection in indoor scenes using multi-view images without requiring depth supervision or ground-truth camera poses. TUN3D utilizes a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone and incorporates two specialized heads for object detection and layout estimation, featuring a unique parametric wall representation. Experimental results demonstrate that TUN3D outperforms existing methods in various scene understanding benchmarks, including those using ground-truth point clouds, posed images, and unposed images.

arXiv:2509.21388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation. Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic indoor scene understanding.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions, which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

The article introduces the concept of skeletonisation scale-spaces, which combine the principles of sparsification and skeletonization to provide a hierarchical simplification of shapes. This framework addresses the sensitivity to noise in traditional medial axis representations by systematically removing extraneous skeletal branches. The approach satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture, controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. The framework includes both continuous and discrete formulations, as well as densification for inverse progression from coarse to fine scales. This approach not only simplifies shapes but also extends the skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in tasks such as robust skeletonization, shape compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing. <div>

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture, controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

<div> Keywords: climate projections, high-resolution, single-image super-resolution models, statistical downscaling, climate indicators

Summary:
Climate projections are crucial for local decision-making but are often limited by low spatial resolution. This study introduces a method that utilizes single-image super-resolution models to downscale climate projections from 12.5 km to 1 km resolution. To overcome the lack of high-resolution training data, the models are trained on observational gridded data. A climate indicator-based assessment approach, using observed climate indices from weather stations, is introduced to evaluate the downscaled projections. Experiments focusing on daily mean temperature show that the super-resolution models effectively downscale climate projections without increasing errors in climate indicators when compared to low-resolution projections. This method provides a promising solution to obtaining higher-resolution climate projections for improved local decision-making and planning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making. However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5 km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections. Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, Jailbreaking, Image Perturbation, Toxicity Metrics, Defense Mechanisms

Summary:
Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation (JaiLIP) is a new attack technique aimed at Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using image perturbations. The method combines mean squared error loss between clean and adversarial images with harmful-output loss to generate highly effective and imperceptible adversarial images. Experimental results show that JaiLIP outperforms existing methods in producing toxicity, as evaluated by standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and Detoxify. The study goes beyond toxic text generation by demonstrating the attack's practicality in the transportation domain, highlighting the challenges of image-based jailbreak attacks on VLMs. The research emphasizes the importance of efficient defense mechanisms to combat the rising concerns of misuse and safety alignment in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation (JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms for VLMs.

Summary:
The article discusses the advancements in automated identification of plants and animals, particularly due to the progress in deep learning technologies. It highlights the challenge of comparing the performance of automated systems to that of human experts, who may also face uncertainties and disagreements in species identification. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge aimed to bridge this gap by evaluating 19 deep-learning systems against the expertise of 9 botanists specializing in the French flora. The results show that state-of-the-art deep learning models have reached a level of performance close to that of the most advanced human expertise. The paper provides details on the challenge resources, assessments, approaches used by research teams, and an analysis of the outcomes. <div>

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty. Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems. In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Summary:<br />
QuadGPT is introduced as an autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes directly, avoiding the need to convert triangle meshes. It utilizes a unified tokenization method to handle mixed topologies and a specialized Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method for improved quality. The approach outperforms existing methods in terms of geometric accuracy and topological quality. This work sets a new benchmark for native quad-mesh generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining large-scale autoregressive models with topology-aware RL refinement in creating structured 3D assets. <div>
arXiv:2509.21420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm, distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

<div> Diffusion models, erasure, copyright, concept suppression, on-demand erasure<br />
<br />
Summary: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) face challenges in reproducing copyrighted styles and protected visual concepts. Concept erasure has been proposed as a solution, but current methods struggle with scaling to practical applications that require erasing multiple and potentially conflicting concepts. The proposed DyME framework addresses this issue by training lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically composing them at inference based on erasure needs. By enforcing bi-level orthogonality constraints, DyME disentangles representation shifts and prevents interference among adapters, leading to improved multi-concept erasure fidelity. The development of the ErasureBench-H benchmark provides a new evaluation framework for assessing erasure performance across different semantic granularities and set sizes. Experimental results show that DyME outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher fidelity in multi-concept erasure while minimizing collateral degradation. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns. Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

<div> large language models, video understanding, evaluation, VideoJudge, multimodal MLLM

Summary:<br />
- Evaluating video understanding models accurately is challenging due to the lack of precise metrics and the high cost of manual evaluation.
- VideoJudge, a specialized multimodal LLM judge, was introduced to evaluate video understanding model outputs.
- VideoJudge-7B outperformed larger MLLM judge baselines in three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks.
- LLM judges performed worse than MLLM judges, highlighting the importance of providing video inputs for evaluation of video understanding tasks.
- The training process of VideoJudge involved a generator and an evaluator interacting to produce high-quality responses conditioned on target ratings. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks, VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation of video understanding tasks.

<div> compression, feature codec, collaborative perception, multi-agent, V2X deployment <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces ReVQom, a feature codec designed for multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) to enhance scene understanding. ReVQom utilizes a bottleneck network paired with residual vector quantization (RVQ) to compress feature dimensions while maintaining spatial identity. This enables significant compression of data, reducing payloads from 8192 bits per pixel to 6-30 bits per pixel per agent with minimal loss in accuracy. On a real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves up to 1365x compression at 6 bits per pixel, with performance matching or outperforming raw-feature CP at 18 bits per pixel. This allows for efficient and accurate collaborative perception among multiple agents, particularly in V2X deployment scenarios, where bandwidth constraints are a key factor. ReVQom demonstrates the potential for ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful performance degradation, making it a promising tool for practical V2X applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however, constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves 273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x), ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward practical V2X deployment.

<br />Summary:
This study examines how Text-to-Image AI models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural inaccuracies in depictions of Saudi Arabia professionals. Analyzing 1,006 images from ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 professions, they found a strong gender imbalance with predominantly male depictions, notably in leadership and technical roles. Cultural inaccuracies in attire, settings, and activities were common, often stemming from misinterpretations rather than progressive portrayals. The models reflect societal biases from their training data, highlighting the need for more diverse data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation methods to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance, background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding 10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance, with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\% male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted activities were frequently observed across all three models. Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans, offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

Summary: 
A new approach to identifying inappropriate content on short video platforms has been proposed, aiming to overcome the limitations of existing methods. By utilizing a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining paradigm, the model is trained on targeted tasks such as caption analysis, visual question answering, and chain-of-thought reasoning. This approach helps bridge the gap between short video content and the original pretraining data of MLLMs, while also improving the model's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines. Experimental results demonstrate that the pretrained model shows significant performance improvements in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning settings, with strong generalization capabilities to previously unseen issues. The proposed approach represents a promising direction for unified inappropriate content detection on evolving short video platforms.

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3) \textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability. Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

Summary: 
GUI-Cursor reframes GUI grounding as an interactive search task where a Vision Language Model generates actions to move a cursor in a GUI to locate UI elements, improving accuracy. It uses dense trajectory-based reinforcement learning and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro datasets. GUI-Cursor learns to solve problems within two steps for 95% of instances and adaptively conducts more steps on difficult examples. The model determines target objects, evaluates spatial relations, and moves the cursor based on movement history. Visual feedback from the cursor helps align predictions with on-screen locations, addressing the challenges of accurately predicting coordinates in high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. Overall, GUI-Cursor demonstrates significant advancements in GUI grounding accuracy and efficiency. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow 93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

Summary:
X-CoT is a new explainable retrieval framework designed to address limitations in existing text-to-video retrieval systems. By incorporating LLM CoT reasoning instead of relying solely on cosine similarities, X-CoT improves retrieval performance and provides detailed rationales for ranking results. The framework expands existing benchmarks with additional video annotations to enhance semantic understanding and reduce data bias. X-CoT includes a retrieval CoT with pairwise comparison steps, allowing for detailed reasoning and complete ranking explanations. This approach enables better assessment of retrieval models and examination of text-video data quality. The code and data for X-CoT are publicly available on GitHub, facilitating further research and development in the field of text-to-video retrieval. <div>
arXiv:2509.21559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Summary:<br />
- The safety of surgical instruments relies on detecting visual defects accurately
- Manual inspection is error-prone, and current automated methods struggle with surgical images
- Existing approaches have issues with false positives, small defect sensitivity, and domain shift
- A new method is proposed for unsupervised defect detection in surgical instruments
- Background masking, patch-based analysis, and domain adaptation enhance defect detection accuracy

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in surgical instrument imagery.

<div> Alignment-based approaches, Linear SEParability, training efficiency, generation quality, SiTs <br />
Summary: 
This article introduces a new regularization approach for training large-scale diffusion models without the need for external encoders or representation alignment. The proposed Linear SEParability (LSEP) regularization promotes the separability of intermediate layer representations within the network itself, incorporating linear probing directly into the learning process. This method improves training efficiency and generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures like SiTs. Results show significant enhancements in both performance metrics, achieving an impressive FID score of 1.46 on the $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset. The LSEP regularization eliminates the computational cost associated with large pretrained encoders and streamlines the training process for diffusion models, leading to more effective and efficient training strategies in the field of machine learning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing. Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment, while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs, achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

<title>Enhancing Contrastive Learning for Geolocalization by Discovering Hard Negatives on Semivariograms</title>

<div> Keywords: image-based geo-localization, contrastive learning, spatial dependency, semivariogram, spatial priors

Summary: 
Accurate image-based geo-localization on a global scale faces challenges due to diverse environments and lack of distinctive landmarks. Current contrastive learning methods align features between images and locations but struggle with false negatives and hard negatives. To address this, a spatially regularized contrastive learning approach is proposed, integrating a geostatistical tool called a semivariogram to capture spatial correlation. By fitting the semivariogram and relating feature space distance to geographical distance, expected visual dissimilarity is defined to identify false and hard negatives. Integrating this strategy into GeoCLIP improves image-based geo-localization performance, especially at finer granularity, demonstrated on the OSV5M dataset. Explicit modeling of spatial priors enhances the ability to distinguish visually similar but geographically distant image pairs.

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly at finer granularity.

<div> Transformer, multimodal, digital human agents, real-time, video calls

Summary:
X-Streamer is a new framework for creating digital human agents capable of interacting through text, speech, and video in real-time. It uses a Thinker-Actor dual-transformer architecture to understand and generate multimodal responses based on streaming user inputs. The Thinker module processes user inputs, while the Actor module generates synchronized multimodal outputs in real-time. The Thinker leverages a pretrained language-speech model, and the Actor uses a diffusion model for generating responses. To ensure long-term stability, X-Streamer incorporates fine-grained cross-modality alignment, context retention, and global identity referencing. The framework runs on two A100 GPUs and can sustain hours-long video chat experiences from any portrait. X-Streamer paves the way for building interactive digital humans with seamless and infinite interaction capabilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs, sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive digital humans.

<div> Forecasting, Motion, Single Image, Trajectory Grids, Generators
<br />
Summary: 
This article presents a method for forecasting motion from a single image by generating dense trajectory grids. The model outperforms previous regressors and generators by capturing scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, leading to more accurate and diverse predictions. The approach is evaluated on simulated data, demonstrating effectiveness in robotics and real-world intuitive physics datasets. While state-of-the-art video generators are considered world models, they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image due to the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion. Fine-tuning on data like falling blocks or mechanical object interactions does not alleviate this limitation. The proposed method shows promise in accurately forecasting motion without the need to observe additional parameters.

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e., predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

<br />Summary: 
This study compares DINOv3 and V-JEPA2 self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition on the UCF Sports dataset. DINOv3 outperforms V-JEPA2 in clustering performance and discrimination capability, particularly for pose-identifiable actions. V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across all action types with lower performance variance. DINOv3 excels at static pose recognition but struggles with motion-dependent actions, while V-JEPA2 provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories. These results highlight the importance of architectural design choices in video analysis systems and offer guidance for feature extraction methods based on task requirements and reliability constraints. <div>

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3, which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories. These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and reliability constraints.

<div> Keywords: Immediate damage assessment, computer vision, disaster imagery, multimodal system, satellite and UAV photos <br />
Summary: 
Immediate damage assessment after natural disasters is crucial, but traditional methods are slow and dangerous. Current computer vision techniques often provide limited information from satellite and UAV images, such as classification labels or segmentation masks. To address this limitation, the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE) was developed, utilizing a dual-architecture approach with pretrained models on satellite and UAV imagery. By incorporating external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet, VLCE can generate comprehensive, contextually-informed descriptions of disaster imagery. Experimental results show that VLCE outperforms baseline models in both semantic alignment and caption informativeness, with a maximum score of 95.33% on InfoMetIC. This dual-architecture system has the potential to automate and improve disaster damage assessment by providing actionable and detailed descriptions from satellite and drone photos. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet, conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive, contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset. Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness. Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models, attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

- Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) method, inspired by multi-omics integration, enhances family separation and produces robust composite signatures.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define representational structure beyond surface design categories.

Summary:
FantasyWorld introduces a geometry-enhanced framework that combines video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch to create high-quality 3D world models. This approach enables joint modeling of video latents and an implicit 3D field in a single pass, improving spatial consistency and utility for 3D tasks. Cross-branch supervision guides video generation with geometry cues and regulates 3D prediction with video priors, resulting in consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations. The latents from the geometric branch can be used for downstream 3D tasks like novel view synthesis and navigation. FantasyWorld outperforms recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency, with gains attributed to the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange. <div>
arXiv:2509.21657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception, outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

Summary: 
MORPH is a shape-agnostic autoregressive foundation model designed for handling partial differential equations (PDEs) using a convolutional vision transformer backbone. The model is capable of processing heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying dimensionality and resolutions, with multiple fields incorporating scalar and vector components. Key features of MORPH include component-wise convolution for capturing local interactions, inter-field cross-attention for propagating information between different physical fields, and axial attentions for reducing computational burden while maintaining expressivity. Pretrained on diverse PDE datasets, MORPH demonstrates superior performance in transfer learning to downstream prediction tasks, outperforming models trained from scratch using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters. The model shows strong generalization capabilities, matching or surpassing existing baselines and state-of-the-art models, making it a flexible and powerful tool for scientific machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency. Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4 and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce \emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO} attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only \textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO} effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge deployment in urban environments.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces the Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR) for multi-object tracking in videos, addressing challenges posed by complex object motions and crowded scenes. Unlike existing frameworks, MATR explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance, reducing conflicts and improving both detection and association accuracy.

On DanceTrack, MATR surpasses the state-of-the-art score without additional data, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers for enhanced multi-object tracking capabilities. The results validate the superiority of MATR in handling challenging tracking scenarios and showcase its potential for advancing the field of multi-object tracking. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6 mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

Summary:
DeLiVR is a novel video deraining method that utilizes Lie groups to enforce spatial and temporal consistency in videos affected by rain streaks, blur, and noise. By incorporating spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases into the network's attention scores, DeLiVR efficiently aligns frames and estimates motion to effectively remove rain streaks. The method includes a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias to achieve geometry-consistent alignment before feature aggregation, as well as a differential group displacement component to estimate velocity and focus on inter-frame relationships. By combining temporal decay and attention masks, DeLiVR accurately matches the direction of rain streaks in videos. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DeLiVR in improving video quality and removing rain-induced artifacts. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise. In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight, we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components. First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity. This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on publicly available benchmarks.

Summary:
In this work, the viability of foundational AI/ML models for SAR object recognition tasks is investigated, with a focus on the application of SSL models. Various visual foundational models are tested, including DINOv2, DINOv3, and PE-Core, highlighting their shortcomings in extracting discriminative SAR target features. Self-Supervised finetuning of SSL models with SAR data proves to be a promising approach, leading to the development of AFRL-DINOv2 and setting a new state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models. The experiments analyze the performance trade-off of using different backbones and downstream task-adaptation recipes, demonstrating the models' ability to overcome challenges in diverse environments. While positive results are achieved, there is still room for improvement in SAR foundation model development. <div>
arXiv:2509.21722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive results, we still have a long way to go.

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout. This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states, highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation network, LFA-Net, which incorporates a newly designed attention module, LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention, enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million parameters, 0.42 MB memory size, and 4.46 GFLOPs, which make it ideal for resource-constrained environments. We validated our proposed model on DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB with outstanding performance in terms of dice scores of 83.28, 87.44, and 84.50% and Jaccard indices of 72.85, 79.31, and 74.70%, respectively. The code of LFA-Net is available online https://github.com/Mehwish4593/LFA-Net.

<title>Incorporating Scene Context and Semantic Labels for Enhanced Group-level Emotion Recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21747</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information, thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>KG-SAM: Injecting Anatomical Knowledge into Segment Anything Models via Conditional Random Fields</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching 78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

<title>UniVid: Unifying Vision Tasks with Pre-trained Video Generation Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21760</link>

arXiv:2509.21760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

<title>CubistMerge: Spatial-Preserving Token Merging For Diverse ViT Backbones</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21764</link>

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks. Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1 accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer (GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals, producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found in https://github.com/iamsnaping/ProDA.git

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment. In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images, thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual prompts, contributing to the development of more ethical AI applications in social media.

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks, attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at https://github.com/ZEUS2035/MIRG-RL.

arXiv:2509.21790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided, variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete, coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation, guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Longscape.

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions. While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact, motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied planning.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47 percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes, implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living. However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge, we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will be released.

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency. These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles, nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and qualitatively.

<title>Deepfakes: we need to re-think the concept of "real" images</title>

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current "fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake" images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely, Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order, improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1 enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores, thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years. However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1) Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits, which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2) Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis. Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at https://stabledub.github.io.

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image, seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning, ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion, making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation. However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution, 24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization accuracy and visual quality.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection. Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently, multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks, ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented, which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks. Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods. Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

<title>TDEdit: A Unified Diffusion Framework for Text-Drag Guided Image Manipulation</title>

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations: text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing, integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising, dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to reproduce all results presented in this work.

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD dataset.

<title>Taming Flow-based I2V Models for Creative Video Editing</title>

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing, which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to realize visual creativity.

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene, enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex, view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC benchmarks.

<title>Spatial Reasoning in Foundation Models: Benchmarking Object-Centric Spatial Understanding</title>

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models. While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models. Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL, LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the community.

<title>PANICL: Mitigating Over-Reliance on Single Prompt in Visual In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training. Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation, single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover, PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM, highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

<title>SingRef6D: Monocular Novel Object Pose Estimation with a Single RGB Reference</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21927</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275 depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second, benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions. Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 6.1% improvement in average recall.

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However, existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders, suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time, and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across four public datasets.

<title>SemanticControl: A Training-Free Approach for Handling Loosely Aligned Visual Conditions in ControlNet</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21938</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions. In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition (e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at https://mung3477.github.io/semantic-control.

<title>Customizing Visual Emotion Evaluation for MLLMs: An Open-vocabulary, Multifaceted, and Scalable Approach</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps, underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/MVEI.

arXiv:2509.21953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency, and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods, particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore, we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios. Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects, recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data. Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets, providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and model will be released soon.

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models, our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369 on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained applications.

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges, as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions, and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at http://geo-r1.github.io.

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable, exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses, with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for evidence anchored defenses.

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users' attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention. In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set. Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

<title>From Bias to Balance: Exploring and Mitigating Spatial Bias in LVLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21984</link>

arXiv:2509.21984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE, introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more holistic visual understanding.

<title>Mind-the-Glitch: Visual Correspondence for Detecting Inconsistencies in Subject-Driven Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21989</link>

arXiv:2509.21989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for advancing this task.

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \& \textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text, audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering, significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.

<title>ERGO: Efficient High-Resolution Visual Understanding for Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21991</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end, we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V* benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a 3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at: https://github.com/nota-github/ERGO.

<title>DualFocus: Depth from Focus with Spatio-Focal Dual Variational Constraints</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions. Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration, specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii) mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition. Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm: active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale. FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal, failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing, FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the development of more robust generative AI.

<title>Exposing Hallucinations To Suppress Them: VLMs Representation Editing With Generative Anchors</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21997</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations, persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation. Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g., achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR. Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B, Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions, our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly available.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1) Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps; (2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of 3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for robotic planning. We present a lightweight agentic multimodal framework for video-based scene understanding. Combining the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i) the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions: procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms, specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the audio-visual source separation task.

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)} decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on \href{https://github.com/inzamamulDU/SpecXNet}{\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{GitHub}}}.

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance, they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity, we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative metrics.

In particular, their directed acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training. While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces. We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+ layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains (AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing applications.

<title>MinerU2.5: A Decoupled Vision-Language Model for Efficient High-Resolution Document Parsing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22186</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22186</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine, two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse, large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately, MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks, while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

<title>Towards Faithful Reasoning in Remote Sensing: A Perceptually-Grounded GeoSpatial Chain-of-Thought for Vision-Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model, RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks. The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

<title>Polysemous Language Gaussian Splatting via Matching-based Mask Lifting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22225</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously addressing their monosemous limitations.

<title>UrbanFeel: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Temporal and Perceptual Understanding of City Scenes through Human Perspective</title>

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5 Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development. Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as beautiful and safety.

<title>A Tale of Two Experts: Cooperative Learning for Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that (1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2) separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3) enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA) mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/JunyiWuCode/FlashEdit.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation. To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed, which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions, outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods, resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen, for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1) representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3) developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations. Our code will be released.

<title>GS-2M: Gaussian Splatting for Joint Mesh Reconstruction and Material Decomposition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference, spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes with realistic layouts.

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent, even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes and different modalities.

<title>Jailbreaking on Text-to-Video Models via Scene Splitting Strategy</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22292</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models, growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models. Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of T2V models.

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation, their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps (instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with higher fidelity.

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle, where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer (SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement, alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available at https://github.com/JinPLu/VeloxSeg.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images, leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator. Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution. Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX, RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition.

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present \textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels. Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\% accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8 architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network (HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of HierLight-YOLO.

Abstract: The proliferation of disinformation, particularly in multimodal contexts combining text and images, presents a significant challenge across digital platforms. This study investigates the potential of large multimodal models (LMMs) in detecting and mitigating false information. We propose to approach multimodal disinformation detection by leveraging the advanced capabilities of the GPT-4o model. Our contributions include: (1) the development of an optimized prompt incorporating advanced prompt engineering techniques to ensure precise and consistent evaluations; (2) the implementation of a structured framework for multimodal analysis, including a preprocessing methodology for images and text to comply with the model's token limitations; (3) the definition of six specific evaluation criteria that enable a fine-grained classification of content, complemented by a self-assessment mechanism based on confidence levels; (4) a comprehensive performance analysis of the model across multiple heterogeneous datasets Gossipcop, Politifact, Fakeddit, MMFakeBench, and AMMEBA highlighting GPT-4o's strengths and limitations in disinformation detection; (5) an investigation of prediction variability through repeated testing, evaluating the stability and reliability of the model's classifications; and (6) the introduction of confidence-level and variability-based evaluation methods. These contributions provide a robust and reproducible methodological framework for automated multimodal disinformation analysis.

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation. Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image, generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

<title>Text Adversarial Attacks with Dynamic Outputs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios, reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64 RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications, which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic (FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image generation by earlier methods.

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly, its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated clinical workflows.

arXiv:2509.22412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup) augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization (CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs) and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in the wild.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality, attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC), which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features, and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN). Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI, GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant, i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw 12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via https://github.com/Mishalfatima/Gamma-Quant

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However, compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains. Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images, significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation performance.

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba, and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements. Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3% on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be available.

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score), optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring substantially less GPU memory.

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs, replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions. Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps. We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery, skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of the category discovery literature at \href{https://github.com/Visual-AI/Category-Discovery}{https://github.com/Visual-AI/Category-Discovery}.

<title>HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

<title>JanusVLN: Decoupling Semantics and Spatiality with Dual Implicit Memory for Vision-Language Navigation</title>

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided, enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii) patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about 97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission efficient for edge cloud learning.

<title>LongLive: Real-time Interactive Long Video Generation</title>

arXiv:2509.22622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity, especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long); and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation. With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains 20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal quality loss.

<title>SPARK: Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework</title>

arXiv:2509.22624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback (RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks, 12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution, particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being 10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant, in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3) Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a 10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized, scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale datasets.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction. Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as "a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details. Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons? While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension -- whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e., spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s. real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest). By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation.

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning. A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile, large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information, making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise. Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods, establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional components.

Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal, language-aided framework for 3D scene graph alignment. Our method addresses the challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++ enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40% on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval requires robust alignment of heterogeneous data types. Most existing methods focus on bi-modal retrieval tasks and rely on distributional alignment techniques such as Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and correlation alignment. However, these methods often suffer from critical limitations, including numerical instability, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and their inability to capture the full structure of the underlying distributions. In this paper, we introduce the Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence, a hyperparameter-free measure that improves both training stability and retrieval performance. We further propose a novel Generalized CS (GCS) divergence inspired by H\"older's inequality. This extension enables direct alignment of three or more modalities within a unified mathematical framework through a bidirectional circular comparison scheme, eliminating the need for exhaustive pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both bi-modal and tri-modal retrieval tasks. The code of our CS/GCS divergence is publicly available at https://github.com/JiahaoZhang666/CSD.

Abstract: Culverts on canals such as the Erie Canal, built originally in 1825, require frequent inspections to ensure safe operation. Human inspection of culverts is challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy access. We introduce VISION, an end-to-end, language-in-the-loop autonomy system that couples a web-scale vision-language model (VLM) with constrained viewpoint planning for autonomous inspection of culverts. Brief prompts to the VLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences, stereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert constraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups. Deployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the see, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images for detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external evaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals achieved 61.4\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final post-re-imaging assessments reached 80\%, indicating that VISION converts tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings.

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and text-to-image support our theory.

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields, from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising. Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/YuanGao-YG/VISION.

<title>SlimDiff: Training-Free, Activation-Guided Hands-free Slimming of Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization, timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical efficiency.

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy. Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.

arXiv:2509.21526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher, two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm. Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with frozen vision backbones.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires long acquisition times, raising costs, reducing accessibility, and making scans more susceptible to motion artifacts. Diffusion probabilistic models that learn data-driven priors can potentially assist in reducing acquisition time. However, they typically require large training datasets that can be prohibitively expensive to collect. Patch-based diffusion models have shown promise in learning effective data-driven priors over small real-valued datasets, but have not yet demonstrated clinical value in MRI. We extend the Patch-based Diffusion Inverse Solver (PaDIS) to complex-valued, multi-coil MRI reconstruction, and compare it against a state-of-the-art whole-image diffusion baseline (FastMRI-EDM) for 7x undersampled MRI reconstruction on the FastMRI brain dataset. We show that PaDIS-MRI models trained on small datasets of as few as 25 k-space images outperform FastMRI-EDM on image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, NRMSE), pixel-level uncertainty, cross-contrast generalization, and robustness to severe k-space undersampling. In a blinded study with three radiologists, PaDIS-MRI reconstructions were chosen as diagnostically superior in 91.7% of cases, compared to baselines (i) FastMRI-EDM and (ii) classical convex reconstruction with wavelet sparsity. These findings highlight the potential of patch-based diffusion priors for high-fidelity MRI reconstruction in data-scarce clinical settings where diagnostic confidence matters.

Abstract: Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics, diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals, and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset, ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic. ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on our website.

Abstract: Multi-Agent System (MAS) powered by Visual Language Models (VLMs) enables challenging tasks but suffers from a novel failure term, multi-agent visual hallucination snowballing, where hallucinations are seeded in a single agent and amplified by following ones due to the over-reliance on textual flow to relay visual information. Through turn-, layer-, and token-wise attention analyses, we provide detailed insights into the essence of hallucination snowballing regarding the reduction of visual attention allocation. It leads us to identify a subset of vision tokens with a unimodal attention peak in middle layers that best preserve visual evidence but gradually diminish in deeper agent turns, resulting in the visual hallucination snowballing in MAS. Thus, we propose ViF, a lightweight, plug-and-play mitigation paradigm that relays inter-agent messages with Visual Flow powered by the selected visual relay tokens and applies attention reallocation to amplify this pattern. The experiment results demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination snowballing, consistently improving the performance across eight benchmarks based on four common MAS structures and ten base models. The source code will be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/ViF.git.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at tasks that integrate visual perception with symbolic reasoning, their performance is often undermined by a critical vulnerability: perception-induced errors that propagate through the reasoning chain. Current reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, while enhancing reasoning abilities, largely fail to address the underlying misalignment between visual grounding and the subsequent reasoning process. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Caption-Regularized Policy Optimization (CapPO)}, a novel RL framework that explicitly enforces perceptual consistency during policy optimization. CapPO integrates two key mechanisms: (1) a caption-based consistency regularization, which minimizes the divergence between responses conditioned on raw images and those conditioned on captions, thereby anchoring reasoning to semantically faithful visual content; and (2) a KL-weighted advantage estimation scheme, which adaptively scales reinforcement signals to strengthen perceptually consistent trajectories while suppressing spurious correlations. Extensive experiments on five math-focused and five general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CapPO achieves competitive performance, yielding gains of +6.0% accuracy on math-related tasks and +2.4% on general reasoning tasks over the base Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while error analysis reveals that CapPO significantly reduces perception-related mistakes compared with baselines. Overall, CapPO provides a simple yet effective framework for improving multimodal reasoning.

<title>Closing the Oracle Gap: Increment Vector Transformation for Class Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC), we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding, we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths, IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is essential for treatment and diagnostics; In case CT are missing or otherwise difficult to obtain, methods for generating synthetic CT (sCT) images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are sought after. Therefore, it is valuable to establish a reference for what strategies are most effective for MRI-to-CT translation. In this paper, we compare the performance of two frequently used architectures for MRI-to-CT translation: a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) and a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (cDDPM). We chose well-established implementations to represent each architecture: Pix2Pix for cGAN, and Palette for cDDPM. We separate the classical 3D translation problem into a sequence of 2D translations on the transverse plane, to investigate the viability of a strategy that reduces the computational cost. We also investigate the impact of conditioning the generative process on a single MRI image/slice and on multiple MRI slices. The performance is assessed using a thorough evaluation protocol, including a novel slice-wise metric Similarity Of Slices (SIMOS), which measures the continuity between transverse slices when compiling the sCTs into 3D format. Our comparative analysis revealed that MRI-to-CT generative models benefit from multi-channel conditional input and using cDDPM as an architecture.

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively. Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel watermarking method for diffusion models. It is based on guiding the diffusion process using the gradient computed from any off-the-shelf watermark decoder. The gradient computation encompasses different image augmentations, increasing robustness to attacks against which the decoder was not originally robust, without retraining or fine-tuning. Our method effectively convert any \textit{post-hoc} watermarking scheme into an in-generation embedding along the diffusion process. We show that this approach is complementary to watermarking techniques modifying the variational autoencoder at the end of the diffusion process. We validate the methods on different diffusion models and detectors. The watermarking guidance does not significantly alter the generated image for a given seed and prompt, preserving both the diversity and quality of generation.

Abstract: Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods typically rely on multi-view video to recover deformation, limiting their applicability under constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame interpolation and interactive object manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image acquisition and scene reconstruction have enabled the generation of high-quality structural urban scene geometry, given sufficient site information. However, current capture techniques often overlook the crucial importance of texture quality, resulting in noticeable visual artifacts in the textured models. In this work, we introduce the urban geometry and texture co-capture problem under limited prior knowledge before a site visit. The only inputs are a 2D building contour map of the target area and a safe flying altitude above the buildings. We propose an innovative aerial path planning framework designed to co-capture images for reconstructing both structured geometry and high-fidelity textures. To evaluate and guide view planning, we introduce a comprehensive texture quality assessment system, including two novel metrics tailored for building facades. Firstly, our method generates high-quality vertical dipping views and horizontal planar views to effectively capture both geometric and textural details. A multi-objective optimization strategy is then proposed to jointly maximize texture fidelity, improve geometric accuracy, and minimize the cost associated with aerial views. Furthermore, we present a sequential path planning algorithm that accounts for texture consistency during image capture. Extensive experiments on large-scale synthetic and real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture reconstruction, enabling the creation of realistic, textured scene proxies at low operational cost.

Abstract: In clinical applications, the utility of segmentation models is often based on the accuracy of derived downstream metrics such as organ size, rather than by the pixel-level accuracy of the segmentation masks themselves. Thus, uncertainty quantification for such metrics is crucial for decision-making. Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular framework to derive such principled uncertainty guarantees, but applying CP naively to the final scalar metric is inefficient because it treats the complex, non-linear segmentation-to-metric pipeline as a black box. We introduce COMPASS, a practical framework that generates efficient, metric-based CP intervals for image segmentation models by leveraging the inductive biases of their underlying deep neural networks. COMPASS performs calibration directly in the model's representation space by perturbing intermediate features along low-dimensional subspaces maximally sensitive to the target metric. We prove that COMPASS achieves valid marginal coverage under exchangeability and nestedness assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate that COMPASS produces significantly tighter intervals than traditional CP baselines on four medical image segmentation tasks for area estimation of skin lesions and anatomical structures. Furthermore, we show that leveraging learned internal features to estimate importance weights allows COMPASS to also recover target coverage under covariate shifts. COMPASS paves the way for practical, metric-based uncertainty quantification for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better reflect clinical data.

Abstract: The safety and reliability of embodied agents rely on accurate and unbiased visual perception. However, existing benchmarks mainly emphasize generalization and robustness under perturbations, while systematic quantification of visual bias remains scarce. This gap limits a deeper understanding of how perception influences decision-making stability. To address this issue, we propose RoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor isolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a perceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that enable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and their interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three representative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three key findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera viewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest success rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual preferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong, asymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias. Finally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic grounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\% on MOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a prerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents.

Abstract: We present a patch-based 3D nnUNet adaptation for MR to CT and CBCT to CT image translation using the multicenter SynthRAD2025 dataset, covering head and neck (HN), thorax (TH), and abdomen (AB) regions. Our approach leverages two main network configurations: a standard UNet and a residual UNet, both adapted from nnUNet for image synthesis. The Anatomical Feature-Prioritized (AFP) loss was introduced, which compares multilayer features extracted from a compact segmentation network trained on TotalSegmentator labels, enhancing reconstruction of clinically relevant structures. Input volumes were normalized per-case using zscore normalization for MRIs, and clipping plus dataset level zscore normalization for CBCT and CT. Training used 3D patches tailored to each anatomical region without additional data augmentation. Models were trained for 1000 and 1500 epochs, with AFP fine-tuning performed for 500 epochs using a combined L1+AFP objective. During inference, overlapping patches were aggregated via mean averaging with step size of 0.3, and postprocessing included reverse zscore normalization. Both network configurations were applied across all regions, allowing consistent model design while capturing local adaptations through residual learning and AFP loss. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation revealed that residual networks combined with AFP yielded sharper reconstructions and improved anatomical fidelity, particularly for bone structures in MR to CT and lesions in CBCT to CT, while L1only networks achieved slightly better intensity-based metrics. This methodology provides a stable solution for cross modality medical image synthesis, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining the automatic nnUNet pipeline with residual learning and anatomically guided feature losses.

<title>Adaptive Dual-Mode Distillation with Incentive Schemes for Scalable, Heterogeneous Federated Learning on Non-IID Data</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning (DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however, not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems.

<title>Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.22562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings: (i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

Abstract: Efficiently detecting human intent to interact with ubiquitous robots is crucial for effective human-robot interaction (HRI) and collaboration. Over the past decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with most existing approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined with depth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactive or non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline for predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling faster robot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intent prediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, which can hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, we introduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with new loss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization on out-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC: 0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB input and supporting precise frame onset prediction. Finally, to support future research, we openly release our new dataset with frame-level labeling of human interaction intent.

<title>Learn the Ropes, Then Trust the Wins: Self-imitation with Progressive Exploration for Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.

Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be open-sourced.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21 open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding; and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal (audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI assistants. Code and data will be released at https://mathllm.github.io/VoiceAssistantEval/ .

Abstract: We present DAWN (Diffusion is All We Need for robot control), a unified diffusion-based framework for language-conditioned robotic manipulation that bridges high-level motion intent and low-level robot action via structured pixel motion representation. In DAWN, both the high-level and low-level controllers are modeled as diffusion processes, yielding a fully trainable, end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions. DAWN achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark, demonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates its effectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap between simulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliable real-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practical viability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Our results show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling with motion-centric representations as a strong baseline for scalable and robust robot learning.

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

Abstract: Radiologists interpret mammography exams by jointly analyzing all four views, as correlations among them are crucial for accurate diagnosis. Recent methods employ dedicated fusion blocks to capture such dependencies, but these are often hindered by view dominance, training instability, and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce multi-view hypercomplex learning, a novel learning paradigm for multi-view breast cancer classification based on parameterized hypercomplex neural networks (PHNNs). Thanks to hypercomplex algebra, our models intrinsically capture both intra- and inter-view relations. We propose PHResNets for two-view exams and two complementary four-view architectures: PHYBOnet, optimized for efficiency, and PHYSEnet, optimized for accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view models, while also generalizing across radiographic modalities and tasks such as disease classification from chest X-rays and multimodal brain tumor segmentation. Full code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/ispamm/PHBreast.

Abstract: The performance of single image super-resolution depends heavily on how to generate and complement high-frequency details to low-resolution images. Recently, diffusion-based DDPM models exhibit great potential in generating high-quality details for super-resolution tasks. They tend to directly predict high-frequency information of wide bandwidth by solely utilizing the high-resolution ground truth as the target for all sampling timesteps. However, as a result, they encounter hallucination problem that they generate mismatching artifacts. To tackle this problem and achieve higher-quality super-resolution, we propose a novel Frequency Domain-guided multiscale Diffusion model (FDDiff), which decomposes the high-frequency information complementing process into finer-grained steps. In particular, a wavelet packet-based frequency degradation pyramid is developed to provide multiscale intermediate targets with increasing bandwidth. Based on these targets, FDDiff guides reverse diffusion process to progressively complement missing high-frequency details over timesteps. Moreover, a multiscale frequency refinement network is designed to predict the required high-frequency components at multiple scales within one unified network. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks are conducted, and demonstrate that FDDiff outperforms prior generative methods with higher-fidelity super-resolution results.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have become powerful image generation tools, especially for few-shot fine-tuning where a pretrained DM is fine-tuned on a small image set to capture specific styles or objects. Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the data leakage risks when releasing fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets including WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting about 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases. The code is available https://github.com/Nicholas0228/FineXtract.

Abstract: A prior represents a set of beliefs or assumptions about a system, aiding inference and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the challenge of unsupervised categorical prior learning in pose estimation, where AI models learn a general pose prior for an object category from images in a self-supervised manner. Although priors are effective in estimating pose, acquiring them can be difficult. We propose a novel method, named Pose Prior Learner (PPL), to learn a general pose prior for any object category. PPL uses a hierarchical memory to store compositional parts of prototypical poses, from which we distill a general pose prior. This prior improves pose estimation accuracy through template transformation and image reconstruction. PPL learns meaningful pose priors without any additional human annotations or interventions, outperforming competitive baselines on both human and animal pose estimation datasets. Notably, our experimental results reveal the effectiveness of PPL using learned prototypical poses for pose estimation on occluded images. Through iterative inference, PPL leverages the pose prior to refine estimated poses, regressing them to any prototypical poses stored in memory. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available.

Abstract: Large-scale pretrained models are widely leveraged as foundations for learning new specialized tasks via fine-tuning, with the goal of maintaining the general performance of the model while allowing it to gain new skills. A valuable goal for all such models is robustness: the ability to perform well on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We assess whether fine-tuning preserves the overall robustness of the pretrained model, and observed that models pretrained on large datasets exhibited strong catastrophic forgetting and loss of OOD generalization. To systematically assess robustness preservation in fine-tuned models, we propose the Robustness Inheritance Benchmark (ImageNet-RIB). The benchmark, which can be applied to any pretrained model, consists of a set of related but distinct OOD (downstream) tasks and involves fine-tuning on one of the OOD tasks in the set then testing on the rest. We find that though continual learning methods help, fine-tuning reduces robustness across pretrained models. Surprisingly, models pretrained on the largest and most diverse datasets (e.g., LAION-2B) exhibit both larger robustness losses and lower absolute robustness after fine-tuning on small datasets, relative to models pretrained on smaller datasets. These findings suggest that starting with the strongest foundation model is not necessarily the best approach for performance on specialist tasks. https://jd730.github.io/projects/ImageNet-RIB

Abstract: In this paper, built upon TAPTRv2, we present TAPTRv3. TAPTRv2 is a simple yet effective DETR-like point tracking framework that works fine in regular videos but tends to fail in long videos. TAPTRv3 improves TAPTRv2 by addressing its shortcomings in querying high-quality features from long videos, where the target tracking points normally undergo increasing variation over time. In TAPTRv3, we propose to utilize both spatial and temporal context to bring better feature querying along the spatial and temporal dimensions for more robust tracking in long videos. For better spatial feature querying, we identify that off-the-shelf attention mechanisms struggle with point-level tasks and present Context-aware Cross-Attention (CCA). CCA introduces spatial context into the attention mechanism to enhance the quality of attention scores when querying image features. For better temporal feature querying, we introduce Visibility-aware Long-Temporal Attention (VLTA), which conducts temporal attention over past frames while considering their corresponding visibilities. This effectively addresses the feature drifting problem in TAPTRv2 caused by its RNN-like long-term modeling. TAPTRv3 surpasses TAPTRv2 by a large margin on most of the challenging datasets and obtains state-of-the-art performance. Even when compared with methods trained on large-scale extra internal data, TAPTRv3 still demonstrates superiority.

Abstract: To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, current ControlNet-like models have explored various control signals to dictate image attributes. However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 2.5, an advanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) series that builds upon InternVL 2.0, maintaining its core model architecture while introducing significant enhancements in training and testing strategies as well as data quality. In this work, we delve into the relationship between model scaling and performance, systematically exploring the performance trends in vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and test-time configurations. Through extensive evaluations on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-discipline reasoning, document understanding, multi-image / video understanding, real-world comprehension, multimodal hallucination detection, visual grounding, multilingual capabilities, and pure language processing, InternVL 2.5 exhibits competitive performance, rivaling leading commercial models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Notably, our model is the first open-source MLLMs to surpass 70% on the MMMU benchmark, achieving a 3.7-point improvement through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and showcasing strong potential for test-time scaling. We hope this model contributes to the open-source community by setting new standards for developing and applying multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Proper guidance strategies are essential to achieve high-quality generation results without retraining diffusion and flow-based text-to-image models. Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, which potentially limits their ability and application scope. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which can significantly improve the quality of the generated image by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. The biggest difference from existing guidance is that SG only relies on the sampling score function of the original diffusion or flow model at different noise levels, with no need for any tricky and expensive guidance-specific training. This makes SG highly flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner by any diffusion or flow models. We also introduce an efficient variant of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid additional forward passes of the diffusion network.We conduct extensive experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG, with 50 percent more efficiency. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability to eliminate human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We have released our code at https://github.com/maple-research-lab/Self-Guidance.

Abstract: The generation of LiDAR scans is a growing topic with diverse applications to autonomous driving. However, scan generation remains challenging, especially when compared to the rapid advancement of image and 3D object generation. We consider the task of LiDAR object generation, requiring models to produce 3D objects as viewed by a LiDAR scan. It focuses LiDAR scan generation on a key aspect of scenes, the objects, while also benefiting from advancements in 3D object generative methods. We introduce a novel diffusion-based model to produce LiDAR point clouds of dataset objects, including intensity, and with an extensive control of the generation via conditioning information. Our experiments on nuScenes and KITTI-360 show the quality of our generations measured with new 3D metrics developed to suit LiDAR objects. The code is available at https://github.com/valeoai/LOGen.

<title>UIP2P: Unsupervised Instruction-based Image Editing via Edit Reversibility Constraint</title>

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised instruction-based image editing approach that removes the need for ground-truth edited images during training. Existing methods rely on supervised learning with triplets of input images, ground-truth edited images, and edit instructions. These triplets are typically generated either by existing editing methods, introducing biases, or through human annotations, which are costly and limit generalization. Our approach addresses these challenges by introducing a novel editing mechanism called Edit Reversibility Constraint (ERC), which applies forward and reverse edits in one training step and enforces alignment in image, text, and attention spaces. This allows us to bypass the need for ground-truth edited images and unlock training for the first time on datasets comprising either real image-caption pairs or image-caption-instruction triplets. We empirically show that our approach performs better across a broader range of edits with high-fidelity and precision. By eliminating the need for pre-existing datasets of triplets, reducing biases associated with current methods, and proposing ERC, our work represents a significant advancement in unblocking scaling of instruction-based image editing.

<title>Unforgettable Lessons from Forgettable Images: Intra-Class Memorability Matters in Computer Vision</title>

Abstract: We introduce intra-class memorability, where certain images within the same class are more memorable than others despite shared category characteristics. To investigate what features make one object instance more memorable than others, we design and conduct human behavior experiments, where participants are shown a series of images, and they must identify when the current image matches the image presented a few steps back in the sequence. To quantify memorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel metric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image presentations into its calculation. Furthermore, we curate the Intra-Class Memorability Dataset (ICMD), comprising over 5,000 images across ten object classes with their ICMscores derived from 2,000 participants' responses. Subsequently, we demonstrate the usefulness of ICMD by training AI models on this dataset for various downstream tasks: memorability prediction, image recognition, continual learning, and memorability-controlled image editing. Surprisingly, high-ICMscore images impair AI performance in image recognition and continual learning tasks, while low-ICMscore images improve outcomes in these tasks. Additionally, we fine-tune a state-of-the-art image diffusion model on ICMD image pairs with and without masked semantic objects. The diffusion model can successfully manipulate image elements to enhance or reduce memorability. Our contributions open new pathways in understanding intra-class memorability by scrutinizing fine-grained visual features behind the most and least memorable images and laying the groundwork for real-world applications in computer vision. We will release all code, data, and models publicly.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how to convert a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) into a linear DiT, as its simplicity, parallelism, and efficiency for image generation. Through detailed exploration, we offer a suite of ready-to-use solutions, ranging from linear attention design to optimization strategies. Our core contributions include 5 practical guidelines: 1) Applying depth-wise convolution within simple linear attention is sufficient for image generation. 2) Using fewer heads in linear attention provides a free-lunch performance boost without increasing latency. 3) Inheriting weights from a fully converged, pre-trained DiT. 4) Loading all parameters except those related to linear attention. 5) Hybrid knowledge distillation: using a pre-trained teacher DiT to help the training of the student linear DiT, supervising not only the predicted noise but also the variance of the reverse diffusion process. These guidelines lead to our proposed \underline{L}inear D\underline{i}ffusion \underline{T}ransformer (LiT), which serves as a safe and efficient alternative baseline for DiT with pure linear attention. In class-conditional 256$\times$256 and 512$\times$512 ImageNet generation, LiT can be quickly adapted from DiT using only $20\%$ and $33\%$ of DiT's training steps, respectively, while achieving comparable performance. LiT also rivals methods based on Mamba or Gated Linear Attention. Moreover, the same guidelines generalize to text-to-image generation: LiT can be swiftly converted from PixArt-$\Sigma$ to generate high-quality images, maintaining comparable GenEval scores.

Abstract: Neural network training tends to exploit the simplest features as shortcuts to greedily minimize training loss. However, some of these features might be spuriously correlated with the target labels, leading to incorrect predictions by the model. Several methods have been proposed to address this issue. Focusing on suppressing the spurious correlations with model training, they not only incur additional training cost, but also have limited practical utility as the model misbehavior due to spurious relations is usually discovered after its deployment. It is also often overlooked that spuriousness is a subjective notion. Hence, the precise questions that must be investigated are; to what degree a feature is spurious, and how we can proportionally distract the model's attention from it for reliable prediction. To this end, we propose a method that enables post-hoc neutralization of spurious feature impact, controllable to an arbitrary degree. We conceptualize spurious features as fictitious sub-classes within the original classes, which can be eliminated by a class removal scheme. We then propose a unique precise class removal technique that makes a single-weight modification, which entails negligible performance compromise for the remaining classes. We perform extensive experiments, demonstrating that by editing just a single weight in a post-hoc manner, our method achieves highly competitive, or better performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with preference optimization is valuable for human-annotated datasets, but the heavy cost of manual data collection limits scalability. Using reward models offers an alternative, however, current preference optimization methods fall short in exploiting the rich information, as they only consider pairwise preference distribution. Furthermore, they lack generalization to multi-preference scenarios and struggle to handle inconsistencies between rewards. To address this, we present Calibrated Preference Optimization (CaPO), a novel method to align T2I diffusion models by incorporating the general preference from multiple reward models without human annotated data. The core of our approach involves a reward calibration method to approximate the general preference by computing the expected win-rate against the samples generated by the pretrained models. Additionally, we propose a frontier-based pair selection method that effectively manages the multi-preference distribution by selecting pairs from Pareto frontiers. Finally, we use regression loss to fine-tune diffusion models to match the difference between calibrated rewards of a selected pair. Experimental results show that CaPO consistently outperforms prior methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in both single and multi-reward settings validated by evaluation on T2I benchmarks, including GenEval and T2I-Compbench.

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) enables image search using a reference image and a text prompt without requiring specialized text-image composition networks trained on large-scale paired data. However, current ZS-CIR approaches suffer from three critical limitations in their reliance on composed text embeddings: static query embedding representations, insufficient utilization of image embeddings, and suboptimal performance when fusing text and image embeddings. To address these challenges, we introduce the \textbf{Prompt Directional Vector (PDV)}, a simple yet effective training-free enhancement that captures semantic modifications induced by user prompts. PDV enables three key improvements: (1) Dynamic composed text embeddings where prompt adjustments are controllable via a scaling factor, (2) composed image embeddings through semantic transfer from text prompts to image features, and (3) weighted fusion of composed text and image embeddings that enhances retrieval by balancing visual and semantic similarity. Our approach serves as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing ZS-CIR methods with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PDV consistently improves retrieval performance when integrated with state-of-the-art ZS-CIR approaches, particularly for methods that generate accurate compositional embeddings. The code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Controllable image-to-video (I2V) generation transforms a reference image into a coherent video guided by user-specified control signals. In content creation workflows, precise and simultaneous control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction enhances both accuracy and flexibility. However, existing approaches typically treat these control signals separately, largely due to the scarcity of datasets with high-quality joint annotations and mismatched control spaces across modalities. We present VidCRAFT3, a unified and flexible I2V framework that supports both independent and joint control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction by integrating three core components. Image2Cloud reconstructs a 3D point cloud from the reference image to enable precise camera motion control. ObjMotionNet encodes sparse object trajectories into multi-scale optical flow features to guide object motion. The Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer integrates lighting direction embeddings via parallel cross-attention. To address the scarcity of jointly annotated data, we curate the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset of synthetic static-scene video clips with per-frame lighting-direction labels, and adopt a three-stage training strategy that enables robust learning without fully joint annotations. Extensive experiments show that VidCRAFT3 outperforms existing methods in control precision and visual coherence. Code and data will be released.

Abstract: We introduce GeoDANO, a geometric vision-language model (VLM) with a domain-agnostic vision encoder, for solving plane geometry problems. Although VLMs have been employed for solving geometry problems, their ability to recognize geometric features remains insufficiently analyzed. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark that evaluates the recognition of visual geometric features, including primitives such as dots and lines, and relations such as orthogonality. Our preliminary study shows that vision encoders often used in general-purpose VLMs, e.g., OpenCLIP, fail to detect these features and struggle to generalize across domains. To overcome the limitation, we develop GeoCLIP, a CLIP-based model trained on synthetic geometric diagram--caption pairs. Benchmark results show that GeoCLIP outperforms existing vision encoders in recognizing geometric features. We then propose our VLM, GeoDANO, which augments GeoCLIP with a domain adaptation strategy for unseen diagram styles. GeoDANO outperforms specialized methods for plane geometry problems and GPT-4o on MathVerse. The implementation is available at https://github.com/ml-postech/GeoDANO.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as promising alternative in 3D representation. However, it still suffers from high training cost. This paper introduces LiteGS, a high performance framework that systematically optimizes the 3DGS training pipeline from multiple aspects. At the low-level computation layer, we design a ``warp-based raster'' associated with two hardware-aware optimizations to significantly reduce gradient reduction overhead. At the mid-level data management layer, we introduce dynamic spatial sorting based on Morton coding to enable a performant ``Cluster-Cull-Compact'' pipeline and improve data locality, therefore reducing cache misses. At the top-level algorithm layer, we establish a new robust densification criterion based on the variance of the opacity gradient, paired with a more stable opacity control mechanism, to achieve more precise parameter growth. Experimental results demonstrate that LiteGS accelerates the original 3DGS training by up to 13.4x with comparable or superior quality and surpasses the current SOTA in lightweight models by up to 1.4x speedup. For high-quality reconstruction tasks, LiteGS sets a new accuracy record and decreases the training time by an order of magnitude.

Abstract: Erasing concepts from large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has become increasingly crucial due to the growing concerns over copyright infringement, offensive content, and privacy violations. In scalable applications, fine-tuning-based methods are time-consuming to precisely erase multiple target concepts, while real-time editing-based methods often degrade the generation quality of non-target concepts due to conflicting optimization objectives. To address this dilemma, we introduce SPEED, an efficient concept erasure approach that directly edits model parameters. SPEED searches for a null space, a model editing space where parameter updates do not affect non-target concepts, to achieve scalable and precise erasure. To facilitate accurate null space optimization, we incorporate three complementary strategies: Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF) to selectively retain the most affected non-target concepts, Directed Prior Augmentation (DPA) to enrich the filtered retain set with semantically consistent variations, and Invariant Equality Constraints (IEC) to preserve key invariants during the T2I generation process. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks demonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in non-target preservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure, successfully erasing 100 concepts within only 5 seconds. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/Ouxiang-Li/SPEED.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding is crucial for robotics applications, such as natural language-driven manipulation, human-robot interaction, and autonomous navigation. Existing methods for querying 3D Gaussian Splatting often struggle with inconsistent 2D mask supervision and lack a robust 3D point-level retrieval mechanism. In this work, (i) we present a novel point-level querying framework that performs tracking on segmentation masks to establish a semantically consistent ground-truth for distilling the language Gaussians; (ii) we introduce a GT-anchored querying approach that first retrieves the distilled ground-truth and subsequently uses the ground-truth to query the individual Gaussians. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art performance. Our method achieves an mIoU improvement of +4.14, +20.42, and +1.7 on the LERF, 3D-OVS, and Replica datasets. These results validate our framework as a promising step toward open-vocabulary understanding in real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: We present DanceText, a training-free framework for multilingual text editing in images, designed to support complex geometric transformations and achieve seamless foreground-background integration. While diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in text-guided image synthesis, they often lack controllability and fail to preserve layout consistency under non-trivial manipulations such as rotation, translation, scaling, and warping. To address these limitations, DanceText introduces a layered editing strategy that separates text from the background, allowing geometric transformations to be performed in a modular and controllable manner. A depth-aware module is further proposed to align appearance and perspective between the transformed text and the reconstructed background, enhancing photorealism and spatial consistency. Importantly, DanceText adopts a fully training-free design by integrating pretrained modules, allowing flexible deployment without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on the AnyWord-3M benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in visual quality, especially under large-scale and complex transformation scenarios. Code is avaible at https://github.com/YuZhenyuLindy/DanceText.git.

Abstract: Neuromorphic event cameras possess superior temporal resolution, power efficiency, and dynamic range compared to traditional cameras. However, their asynchronous and sparse data format poses a significant challenge for conventional deep learning methods. Existing solutions to this incompatibility often sacrifice temporal resolution, require extensive pre-processing, and do not fully leverage GPU acceleration. Inspired by word-to-vector models, we draw an analogy between words and events to introduce event2vec, a novel representation that allows neural networks to process events directly. This approach is fully compatible with the parallel processing and self-supervised learning capabilities of Transformer architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of event2vec on the DVS Gesture, ASL-DVS, and DVS-Lip benchmarks. A comprehensive ablation study further analyzes our method's features and contrasts them with existing representations. The experimental results show that event2vec is remarkably parameter-efficient, has high throughput, and can achieve high accuracy even with an extremely low number of events. Beyond its performance, the most significant contribution of event2vec is a new paradigm that enables neural networks to process event streams as if they were natural language. This paradigm shift paves the way for the native integration of event cameras with large language models and multimodal models. Code, model, and training logs are provided in https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Panda/event2vec.

Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CARL, a model for Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic representation, we introduce a novel spectral encoder, featuring a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism, to distill salient spectral information into learned spectral representations. Spatio-spectral pre-training is achieved with a novel feature-based self-supervision strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has achieved significant success in natural language processing, motivating its adaptation to computer vision tasks. Unlike convolutional neural networks, vision transformers inherently capture long-range dependencies and enable parallel processing, yet lack inductive biases and efficiency benefits, facing significant computational and memory challenges that limit its real-world applicability. This paper surveys various online strategies for generating lightweight vision transformers for image recognition, focusing on three key areas: Efficient Component Design, Dynamic Network, and Knowledge Distillation. We evaluate the relevant exploration for each topic on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, analyzing trade-offs among precision, parameters, throughput, and more to highlight their respective advantages, disadvantages, and flexibility. Finally, we propose future research directions and potential challenges in the lightweighting of vision transformers with the aim of inspiring further exploration and providing practical guidance for the community.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Reward Models (RMs) have shown significant promise in delivering reward signals to align vision models with human preferences. However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct responses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often leading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long chains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly strengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be improved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward model, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both visual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize the model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount of image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o, which is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure of CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge and generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal preference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision tasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection sampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally used for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize for correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision reward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.

Abstract: In recent years, language-guided open-set aerial object detection has gained significant attention due to its better alignment with real-world application needs. However, due to limited datasets, most existing language-guided methods primarily focus on vocabulary-level descriptions, which fail to meet the demands of fine-grained open-world detection. To address this limitation, we propose constructing a large-scale language-guided open-set aerial detection dataset, encompassing three levels of language guidance: from words to phrases, and ultimately to sentences. Centered around an open-source large vision-language model and integrating image-operation-based preprocessing with BERT-based postprocessing, we present the OS-W2S Label Engine, an automatic annotation pipeline capable of handling diverse scene annotations for aerial images. Using this label engine, we expand existing aerial detection datasets with rich textual annotations and construct a novel benchmark dataset, called MI-OAD, addressing the limitations of current remote sensing grounding data and enabling effective language-guided open-set aerial detection. Specifically, MI-OAD contains 163,023 images and 2 million image-caption pairs, approximately 40 times larger than comparable datasets. To demonstrate the effectiveness and quality of MI-OAD, we evaluate three representative tasks. On language-guided open-set aerial detection, training on MI-OAD lifts Grounding DINO by +31.1 AP$_{50}$ and +34.7 Recall@10 with sentence-level inputs under zero-shot transfer. Moreover, using MI-OAD for pre-training yields state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing open-vocabulary aerial detection and remote sensing visual grounding benchmarks, validating both the effectiveness of the dataset and the high quality of its OS-W2S annotations. More details are available at https://github.com/GT-Wei/MI-OAD.

Abstract: When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (e.g. speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce Intentional-Gesture, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. First, we curate the InG dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (i.e., text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (e.g., intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture

Abstract: Why are state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) not designed to exploit natural geometric symmetries such as 90-degree rotations and reflections? In this paper, we argue that there is no fundamental reason, and what has been missing is an efficient implementation. To this end, we introduce Octic Vision Transformers (octic ViTs) which rely on octic group equivariance to capture these symmetries. In contrast to prior equivariant models that increase computational cost, our octic linear layers achieve 5.33x reductions in FLOPs and up to 8x reductions in memory compared to ordinary linear layers. In full octic ViT blocks the computational reductions approach the reductions in the linear layers with increased embedding dimension. We study two new families of ViTs, built from octic blocks, that are either fully octic equivariant or break equivariance in the last part of the network. Training octic ViTs supervised (DeiT-III) and unsupervised (DINOv2) on ImageNet-1K, we find that they match baseline accuracy while at the same time providing substantial efficiency gains.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D content generation have amplified demand for dynamic models that are both visually realistic and physically consistent. However, state-of-the-art video diffusion models frequently produce implausible results such as momentum violations and object interpenetrations. Existing physics-aware approaches often rely on task-specific fine-tuning or supervised data, which limits their scalability and applicability. To address the challenge, we present PhyMAGIC, a training-free framework that generates physically consistent motion from a single image. PhyMAGIC integrates a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model, confidence-guided reasoning via LLMs, and a differentiable physics simulator to produce 3D assets ready for downstream physical simulation without fine-tuning or manual supervision. By iteratively refining motion prompts using LLM-derived confidence scores and leveraging simulation feedback, PhyMAGIC steers generation toward physically consistent dynamics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PhyMAGIC outperforms state-of-the-art video generators and physics-aware baselines, enhancing physical property inference and motion-text alignment while maintaining visual fidelity.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of generative Diffusion Models (DMs), their internal working is still not well understood, which is potentially problematic. This paper focuses on exploring the important notion of bias-variance tradeoff in diffusion models. Providing a systematic foundation for this exploration, it establishes that at one extreme, the diffusion models may amplify the inherent bias in the training data, and on the other, they may compromise the presumed privacy of the training samples. Our exploration aligns with the memorization-generalization understanding of the generative models, but it also expands further along this spectrum beyond "generalization", revealing the risk of bias amplification in deeper models. Our claims are validated both theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture for video generation, yet their computational and memory demands hinder practical deployment. While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on computation-heavy and inflexible calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) Bounded-init Grid Refinement (BGR) and (2) Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS) for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately 2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on advanced DiT models while maintaining visual fidelity. Notably, DVD-Quant is the first to enable W4A4 PTQ for Video DiTs without compromising video quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/lhxcs/DVD-Quant.

Abstract: Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information. However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 440 chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning, 2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

Abstract: Ratio-based biomarkers -- such as the proportion of necrotic tissue within a tumor -- are widely used in clinical practice to support diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. These biomarkers are typically estimated from soft segmentation outputs by computing region-wise ratios. Despite the high-stakes nature of clinical decision making, existing methods provide only point estimates, offering no measure of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a unified confidence-aware framework for estimating ratio-based biomarkers. Our uncertainty analysis stems from two observations: i) the probability ratio estimator inherently admits a statistical confidence interval regarding local randomness (bias and variance), ii) the segmentation network is not perfectly calibrated. We conduct a systematic analysis of error propagation in the segmentation-to-biomarker pipeline and identify model miscalibration as the dominant source of uncertainty. We leverage tunable parameters to control the confidence level of the derived bounds, allowing adaptation towards clinical practice. Extensive experiments show that our method produces statistically sound confidence intervals, with tunable confidence levels, enabling more trustworthy application of predictive biomarkers in clinical workflows.

<title>Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based methods for 3D human pose estimation face significant computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM). However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3D joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.

<title>Towards Scalable Language-Image Pre-training for 3D Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: The scalability of current language-image pre-training for 3D medical imaging, such as CT and MRI, is constrained by the need for radiologists to manually curate raw clinical studies. In this work, we pioneer pre-training directly on uncurated studies, which both aligns more closely with the radiologist's workflow and provides a natural path to scalability. However, the unique structure of such data presents new challenges for existing model architectures, which were originally designed for 2D slices or single 3D scans. To address this, we introduce a novel hierarchical attention mechanism inspired by the intrinsic hierarchy of radiology data: slice, scan, and study. We denote our framework as Hierarchical attention for Language-Image Pre-training (HLIP). Trained on 220K studies with 3.13 million scans for brain MRI and 240K studies with 1.44 million scans for head CT, HLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., +10.5% balanced ACC on the proposed publicly available brain MRI benchmark Pub-Brain-5; +8.3% and +1.7% macro AUC on head CT benchmarks CQ500 and RSNA, respectively. HLIP also exhibits strong generalizability on existing 3D medical language-image pre-training benchmarks, e.g., +4.3% macro AUC on the Rad-ChestCT benchmark when pre-trained on CT-RATE. These results demonstrate that, with HLIP, directly pre-training on uncurated clinical datasets is a scalable and effective direction for language-image pre-training in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: While generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting enables efficient, high-quality rendering of unseen scenes, it heavily depends on precise camera poses for accurate geometry. In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for more precise Gaussian placement. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that our method achieves robust performance in pose-free generalizable Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: Current video diffusion models generate visually compelling content but often violate basic laws of physics, producing subtle artifacts like rubber-sheet deformations and inconsistent object motion. We introduce a frequency-domain physics prior that improves motion plausibility without modifying model architectures. Our method decomposes common rigid motions (translation, rotation, scaling) into lightweight spectral losses, requiring only 2.7% of frequency coefficients while preserving 97%+ of spectral energy. Applied to Open-Sora, MVDIT, and Hunyuan, our approach improves both motion accuracy and action recognition by ~11% on average on OpenVID-1M (relative), while maintaining visual quality. User studies show 74--83% preference for our physics-enhanced videos. It also reduces warping error by 22--37% (depending on the backbone) and improves temporal consistency scores. These results indicate that simple, global spectral cues are an effective drop-in regularizer for physically plausible motion in video diffusion.

Abstract: Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'), require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. LLM-based methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with light wood furniture'), but lack editing functionality, are limited to rectangular layouts, or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room boundaries that enables asset-agnostic deployment and frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further introduce a voxelization-based evaluation capturing fine-grained geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass state-of-the-art on addition and achieve superior human-perceived quality on full scene synthesis.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of surveillance cameras has increased the demand for automated violence detection. While CNNs and Transformers have shown success in extracting spatio-temporal features, they struggle with long-term dependencies and computational efficiency. We propose Dual Branch VideoMamba with Gated Class Token Fusion (GCTF), an efficient architecture combining a dual-branch design and a state-space model (SSM) backbone where one branch captures spatial features, while the other focuses on temporal dynamics. The model performs continuous fusion via a gating mechanism between the branches to enhance the model's ability to detect violent activities even in challenging surveillance scenarios. We also present a new benchmark by merging RWF-2000, RLVS, SURV and VioPeru datasets in video violence detection, ensuring strict separation between training and testing sets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark and also on DVD dataset which is another novel dataset on video violence detection, offering an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating the promise of SSMs for scalable, near real-time surveillance violence detection.

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made tremendous progress in text-to-video generation, but their high compute demands pose a major challenge for practical deployment. While studies propose acceleration methods to reduce workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting their applicability.
  We introduce Astraea, a framework that searches for near-optimal configurations for vDiT-based video generation under a performance target. At its core, Astraea proposes a lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-friendly sparse attention strategy, enabling linear savings on execution time with minimal impact on generation quality. Meanwhile, to determine optimal token reduction for different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of the token budget effectively. Together, Astraea achieves up to 2.4$\times$ inference speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2$\times$ speedup on 8 GPUs) while achieving up to over 10~dB video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods ($<$0.5\% loss on VBench compared to baselines).

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by drivers of autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from drivers' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Abstract: High-level representations have become a central focus in enhancing AI transparency and control, shifting attention from individual neurons or circuits to structured semantic directions that align with human-interpretable concepts. Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP) framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI robustness, fairness, and transparency.

Abstract: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel diffusion-based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting that exploits spectral sparsity and structural heterogeneity of projection data. It progressively extracts global structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. Considering the structural features of sinograms, we incorporate frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory usage by up to 30.81% and inference time by up to 17.58% than the state-of-the-art framework, and maintains inpainting accuracy across.

Abstract: The "Reason-Then-Respond" paradigm, enhanced by Reinforcement Learning, has shown great promise in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models. However, its application to the video domain has led to specialized models that excel at either question answering (QA) or captioning tasks, but struggle to master both. Naively combining reward signals from these tasks results in mutual performance degradation, which we attribute to a conflict between their opposing task natures. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training framework built upon two intermediate proxy tasks: DarkEventInfer, which presents videos with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content based on contextual video cues; and MixVidQA, which presents interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. These proxy tasks compel the model to simultaneously develop both holistic, divergent understanding and precise, convergent reasoning capabilities. Embodying this framework, we present VidBridge-R1, the first versatile video reasoning model that effectively bridges the paradigm conflict. Extensive experiments show that VidBridge-R1 achieves significant performance gains on both QA and captioning within one model, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in fostering more generalizable and powerful video understanding models.

Abstract: Developing vision-language models (VLMs) capable of understanding 3D scenes has been a longstanding goal in the 3D-VL community. Despite recent progress, 3D VLMs still fall short of their 2D counterparts in capability and robustness. A key bottleneck is that current scene representations struggle to balance performance and efficiency: competitive performance comes at the cost of heavy token overhead, which in turn hampers the scalability of 3D-VL learning. To address this, we propose the condensed feature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation featuring significantly reduced token overhead and strong perception capability. Building on CFG, we introduce LEO-VL, a 3D VLM trained on 700k 3D-VL data spanning four real-world indoor domains and five tasks such as captioning and dialogue. To enhance the robustness of 3D VLM, we further propose SceneDPO for post-training, which involves contrasts across answers and scenes. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on various 3D QA benchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Our extensive experiments highlight the efficiency of our representation, the benefit of task and scene diversity, consistent scaling effects, and the advantages of SceneDPO compared to SFT and GRPO. We hope our findings advance the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of future 3D VLMs.

Abstract: Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).

Abstract: We present video-SALMONN 2, a family of audio-visual large language models that set new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in video description and question answering (QA). Our core contribution is multi-round direct preference optimisation (MrDPO), paired with a caption-quality objective that jointly rewards completeness and factual accuracy. Unlike standard DPO with a fixed reference policy, MrDPO periodically refreshes the reference by bootstrapping from a newly re-initialised lightweight adapter trained on the latest preferences, avoiding reference staleness and enabling continual improvement. This strategy produces captions that are consistently more detailed and accurate than those from proprietary systems such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro. We further distil these gains by using our model to generate a high-quality video-caption corpus for supervised fine-tuning of new models, transferring benefits beyond captioning to strong performance on complex video-QA tasks. Across widely used audio-visual and visual-only understanding benchmarks (including Video-MME, WorldSense, AVUT, Video-Holmes, DailyOmni, MLVU, and LVBench), our 3B and 7B models achieve SOTA results at comparable scales, while the 72B model surpasses all other open-source systems.

Abstract: Temporal Change Description (TCD) and Future Satellite Image Forecasting (FSIF) are critical, yet historically disjointed tasks in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) analysis. Both are fundamentally limited by the common challenge of modeling long-range temporal dynamics. To explore how to improve the performance of methods on both tasks simultaneously by enhancing long-range temporal understanding capabilities, we introduce TAMMs, the first unified framework designed to jointly perform TCD and FSIF within a single MLLM-diffusion architecture. TAMMs introduces two key innovations: Temporal Adaptation Modules (TAM) enhance frozen MLLM's ability to comprehend long-range dynamics, and Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism translates this change understanding into fine-grained generative control. This synergistic design makes the understanding from the TCD task to directly inform and improve the consistency of the FSIF task. Extensive experiments demonstrate TAMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art specialist baselines on both tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in conditional generation by progressively denoising Gaussian samples toward a target data distribution. This denoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned representation space, where the model iteratively refines a sample toward regions of higher probability. However, this learned climbing often converges to local optima with plausible but suboptimal generations due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. While prior efforts often strengthen guidance signals or introduce fixed exploration strategies to address this, they exhibit limited capacity to escape steep local maxima. In contrast, we propose Controlled Random Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy that adaptively detects and escapes such traps through controlled exploration. In each diffusion step, we first identify potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon such detection, we inject noise and revert to a previous, noisier state to escape the current plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories, accepting only those that offer improvement, otherwise scheming progressively deeper explorations when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the generated outputs. The proposed method is model-agnostic and also compatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that Ctrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality while requiring only about 7.72 times the NFEs of the original.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

<title>Reasoning to Edit: Hypothetical Instruction-Based Image Editing with Visual Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting, moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities. Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis, incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our dataset and code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding (segmentation) tasks into a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

<title>Investigating Redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models with Multiple Vision Encoders</title>

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly integrate multiple vision encoders to improve performance on various benchmarks, assuming that diverse pretraining objectives yield complementary visual signals. However, we show this assumption often fails in practice. Through systematic encoder masking across representative multi encoder MLLMs, we find that performance typically degrades gracefully and sometimes even improves when selected encoders are masked, revealing pervasive encoder redundancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce two principled metrics: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR), which measures an encoders marginal contribution in the presence of others, and the Information Gap (IG), which captures heterogeneity in encoder utility within a model. Using these tools, we observe (i) strong specialization on tasks like OCR and Chart, where a single encoder can dominate with a CUR greater than 90%, (ii) high redundancy on general VQA and knowledge-based tasks, where encoders are largely interchangeable, (iii) instances of detrimental encoders with negative CUR. Notably, masking specific encoders can yield up to 16% higher accuracy on a specific task category and 3.6% overall performance boost compared to the full model.Furthermore, single and dual encoder variants recover over 90% of baseline on most non OCR tasks. Our analysis challenges the more encoders are better heuristic in MLLMs and provides actionable diagnostics for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our optimization strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared component is exchanged during communication rounds. Through extensive experiments across eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods.

Abstract: With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

Abstract: Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.

Abstract: The advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced end-to-end autonomous driving, demonstrating powerful reasoning abilities for high-level behavior planning tasks. However, existing methods are often constrained by a passive perception paradigm, relying solely on text-based reasoning. This passivity restricts the model's capacity to actively seek crucial visual evidence when faced with uncertainty. To address this, we introduce DriveAgent-R1, the first autonomous driving agent capable of active perception for planning. In complex scenarios, DriveAgent-R1 proactively invokes tools to perform visual reasoning, firmly grounding its decisions in visual evidence, thereby enhancing both interpretability and reliability. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid thinking framework, inspired by human driver cognitive patterns, allowing the agent to adaptively switch between efficient text-only reasoning and robust tool-augmented visual reasoning based on scene complexity. This capability is cultivated through a three-stage progressive training strategy, featuring a core Cascaded Reinforcement Learning (Cascaded RL) phase. Extensive experiments on the Drive-Internal dataset, which is rich in long-tail scenarios, and the public nuScenes dataset show that, with only 3B parameters, DriveAgent-R1 achieves competitive performance comparable to top closed model systems such as GPT-5 and to human driving proficiency while remaining deployment-friendly, offering a proven path toward building more intelligent autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically important task that involves translating mathematical expressions and structured visual content from images into LaTeX code. In recent years, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a range of visual understanding tasks, largely due to their strong generalization capabilities. However, despite initial efforts to apply VLMs to the Img2LaTeX task, their performance remains suboptimal. Empirical evidence shows that VLMs can be challenged by fine-grained visual elements, such as subscripts and superscripts in mathematical expressions, which results in inaccurate LaTeX generation. To address this challenge, we propose $A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework, enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve LaTeX generation quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset, Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$ significantly improves model performance across various evaluation metrics spanning both textual and visual levels; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and further evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach and the synergy of its core components during inference.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is crucial for scaling autonomous driving systems. While Transformer-based methods have become prevalent in online HD map construction, most existing approaches overlook the inherent spatial dependencies and semantic relationships among map elements, which constrains their accuracy and generalization capabilities. To address this, we propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that explicitly models both spatial relations and semantic priors to enhance online HD map construction. Specifically, we introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. RelMap is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.

Abstract: Recent learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However, the standard Mamba adopts content-agnostic, predefined raster (or multi-directional) scans under strict causality. This rigidity hinders its ability to effectively eliminate redundancy between tokens that are content-correlated but spatially distant. We introduce Content-Aware Mamba (CAM), an SSM that dynamically adapts its processing to the image content. Specifically, CAM overcomes prior limitations with two novel mechanisms. First, it replaces the rigid scan with a content-adaptive token permutation strategy to prioritize interactions between content-similar tokens regardless of their location. Second, it overcomes the sequential dependency by injecting sample-specific global priors into the state-space model, which effectively mitigates the strict causality without multi-directional scans. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global redundancy while preserving computational efficiency. Our Content-Aware Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by 15.91%, 21.34%, and 17.58% in BD-rate on the Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC datasets, respectively. Code and checkpoints will be released later.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable progress, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the standard for high-fidelity generation. However, the conventional practice of applying a strong, fixed guidance scale throughout inference is poorly suited for the rapid, few-step sampling required by modern applications. In this work, we uncover the root cause of this conflict: a fundamental sampling instability where the earliest steps are acutely sensitive to guidance. We trace this to a significant spike in the ratio of conditional to unconditional predictions--a spike that we prove to be an inherent property of the training data distribution itself, making it a almost inevitable challenge. Applying a high, static guidance value during this volatile initial phase leads to an exponential amplification of error, degrading image quality. To resolve this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, adaptive guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps based on the evolving ratio. Our method is lightweight, incurs no inference overhead, and is compatible with standard frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image (SD3.5, Qwen-Image) and video (WAN2.1) models show our approach enables up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving quality, robustness, and semantic alignment. Our findings highlight that adapting guidance to the sampling process, rather than fixing it, is critical for unlocking the full potential of fast, flow-based models.

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge, we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness, and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual, and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents. Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual, time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches. Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of 0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4 model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82). YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

<title>Re-Densification Meets Cross-Scale Propagation: Real-Time Neural Compression of LiDAR Point Clouds</title>

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead. Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding. This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for encoding/decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at https://github.com/pengpeng-yu/FastPCC.

<title>Draw-In-Mind: Rebalancing Designer-Painter Roles in Unified Multimodal Models Benefits Image Editing</title>

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i) DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale, DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits for image editing. Our dataset and models are available at https://github.com/showlab/DIM.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks interpretability: they only determine whether two images correspond, without explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy. Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods, we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/GLEAM.

<title>A Fully Automatic Framework for Intracranial Pressure Grading: Integrating Keyframe Identification, ONSD Measurement and Clinical Data</title>

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation, subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding, limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation, rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786, significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm 0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute neurological conditions.

<title>Group Evidence Matters: Tiling-based Semantic Gating for Dense Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter[cite: 5]. This paper presents a detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids) and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to 0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects, spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with modern detectors[cite: 12]. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and extend the approach with temporal cues[cite: 13].

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency, and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a 3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

<title>GLip: A Global-Local Integrated Progressive Framework for Robust Visual Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon two key insights: (i) learning an initial coarse alignment between visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content facilitates the subsequent learning of precise visual-to-speech mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions, refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced challenging Mandarin dataset.

Abstract: Deep learning models, while achieving remarkable performances, are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Although various defenses have been proposed, there is still substantial room for improvement in the privacy-utility trade-off. In this work, we introduce a novel defense framework against MIAs by leveraging generative models. The key intuition of our defense is to remove the differences between member and non-member inputs, which is exploited by MIAs, by re-generating input samples before feeding them to the target model. Therefore, our defense, called DIFFENCE, works pre inference, which is unlike prior defenses that are either training-time or post-inference time.
  A unique feature of DIFFENCE is that it works on input samples only, without modifying the training or inference phase of the target model. Therefore, it can be cascaded with other defense mechanisms as we demonstrate through experiments. DIFFENCE is designed to preserve the model's prediction labels for each sample, thereby not affecting accuracy. Furthermore, we have empirically demonstrated it does not reduce the usefulness of confidence vectors. Through extensive experimentation, we show that DIFFENCE can serve as a robust plug-n-play defense mechanism, enhancing membership privacy without compromising model utility. For instance, DIFFENCE reduces MIA accuracy against an undefended model by 15.8\% and attack AUC by 14.0\% on average across three datasets, all without impacting model utility. By integrating DIFFENCE with prior defenses, we can achieve new state-of-the-art performances in the privacy-utility trade-off. For example, when combined with the state-of-the-art SELENA defense it reduces attack accuracy by 9.3\%, and attack AUC by 10.0\%. DIFFENCE achieves this by imposing a negligible computation overhead, adding only 57ms to the inference time per sample processed on average.

Abstract: Modern deep learning reconstruction algorithms generate impressively realistic scans from sparse inputs, but can often produce significant inaccuracies. This makes it difficult to provide statistically guaranteed claims about the true state of a subject from scans reconstructed by these algorithms. In this study, we propose a framework for computing provably valid prediction bounds on claims derived from probabilistic black-box image reconstruction algorithms. The key insights behind our framework are to represent reconstructed scans with a derived clinical metric of interest, and to calibrate bounds on the ground truth metric with conformal prediction (CP) using a prior calibration dataset. These bounds convey interpretable feedback about the subject's state, and can also be used to retrieve nearest-neighbor reconstructed scans for visual inspection. We demonstrate the utility of this framework on sparse-view computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification and radiotherapy planning tasks. Results show that our framework produces bounds with better semantical interpretation than conventional pixel-based bounding approaches. Furthermore, we can flag dangerous outlier reconstructions that look plausible but have statistically unlikely metric values.

Abstract: Accurate geo-localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is crucial for outdoor applications including search and rescue operations, power line inspections, and environmental monitoring. The vulnerability of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals to interference and spoofing necessitates the development of additional robust localization methods for autonomous navigation. Visual Geo-localization (VG), leveraging onboard cameras and reference satellite maps, offers a promising solution for absolute localization. Specifically, Thermal Geo-localization (TG), which relies on image-based matching between thermal imagery with satellite databases, stands out by utilizing infrared cameras for effective nighttime localization. However, the efficiency and effectiveness of current TG approaches, are hindered by dense sampling on satellite maps and geometric noises in thermal query images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce STHN, a novel UAV thermal geo-localization approach that employs a coarse-to-fine deep homography estimation method. This method attains reliable thermal geo-localization within a 512-meter radius of the UAV's last known location even with a challenging 11% size ratio between thermal and satellite images, despite the presence of indistinct textures and self-similar patterns. We further show how our research significantly enhances UAV thermal geo-localization performance and robustness against geometric noises under low-visibility conditions in the wild. The code is made publicly available.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are crucial for the success of deep neural networks, but labeling data can be prohibitively expensive in domains such as medical imaging. This work tackles the subset selection problem: selecting a small set of the most informative examples from a large unlabeled pool for annotation. We propose a simple and effective method that combines feature norms, randomization, and orthogonality (via the Gram-Schmidt process) to select diverse and informative samples. Feature norms serve as a proxy for informativeness, while randomization and orthogonalization reduce redundancy and encourage coverage of the feature space. Extensive experiments on image and text benchmarks, including CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet, ImageNet, OrganAMNIST, and Yelp, show that our method consistently improves subset selection performance, both as a standalone approach and when integrated with existing techniques.

Abstract: The successful deployment of deep learning-based techniques for autonomous systems is highly dependent on the data availability for the respective system in its deployment environment. Especially for unstructured outdoor environments, very few datasets exist for even fewer robotic platforms and scenarios. In an earlier work, we presented the German Outdoor and Offroad Dataset (GOOSE) framework along with 10000 multimodal frames from an offroad vehicle to enhance the perception capabilities in unstructured environments. In this work, we address the generalizability of the GOOSE framework. To accomplish this, we open-source the GOOSE-Ex dataset, which contains additional 5000 labeled multimodal frames from various completely different environments, recorded on a robotic excavator and a quadruped platform. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the semantic segmentation performance on different platforms and sensor modalities in unseen environments. In addition, we demonstrate how the combined datasets can be utilized for different downstream applications or competitions such as offroad navigation, object manipulation or scene completion. The dataset, its platform documentation and pre-trained state-of-the-art models for offroad perception will be made available on https://goose-dataset.de/.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on massive, web-scale datasets. Training them from scratch is computationally expensive, and as a result, developers often prefer to make incremental updates to existing models. These updates often compose fine-tuning steps (to learn new concepts or improve model performance) with "unlearning" steps (to "forget" existing concepts, such as copyrighted works or explicit content). In this work, we demonstrate a critical and previously unknown vulnerability that arises in this paradigm: even under benign, non-adversarial conditions, fine-tuning a text-to-image diffusion model on seemingly unrelated images can cause it to "relearn" concepts that were previously "unlearned." We comprehensively investigate the causes and scope of this phenomenon, which we term concept resurgence, by performing a series of experiments which compose "concept unlearning" with subsequent fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion v1.4 and Stable Diffusion v2.1. Our findings underscore the fragility of composing incremental model updates, and raise serious new concerns about current approaches to ensuring the safety and alignment of text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment. Code is available at https://github.com/krafton-ai/Rare-to-Frequent.

Abstract: Realistic and interactive surgical simulation has the potential to facilitate crucial applications, such as medical professional training and autonomous surgical agent training. In the natural visual domain, world models have enabled action-controlled data generation, demonstrating the potential to train autonomous agents in interactive simulated environments when large-scale real data acquisition is infeasible. However, such works in the surgical domain have been limited to simplified computer simulations, and lack realism. Furthermore, existing literature in world models has predominantly dealt with action-labeled data, limiting their applicability to real-world surgical data, where obtaining action annotation is prohibitively expensive. Inspired by the recent success of Genie in leveraging unlabeled video game data to infer latent actions and enable action-controlled data generation, we propose the first surgical vision world model. The proposed model can generate action-controllable surgical data and the architecture design is verified with extensive experiments on the unlabeled SurgToolLoc-2022 dataset.

Abstract: Generating human-like and adaptive trajectories is essential for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of personalized driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving styles. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on NavSim benchmark. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable visual and linguistic capabilities, achieving impressive performance in various tasks such as image recognition and object localization. However, their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks remains an open question. In everyday scenarios, individuals encountering design materials, such as magazines, typography tutorials, research papers, or branding content, may wish to identify aesthetically pleasing fonts used in the text. Given their multimodal capabilities and free accessibility, many VLMs are often considered potential tools for font recognition. This raises a fundamental question: Do VLMs truly possess the capability to recognize fonts? To investigate this, we introduce the Font Recognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising 15 commonly used fonts. FRB includes two versions: (i) an easy version, where 10 sentences are rendered in different fonts, and (ii) a hard version, where each text sample consists of the names of the 15 fonts themselves, introducing a stroop effect that challenges model perception. Through extensive evaluation of various VLMs on font recognition tasks, we arrive at the following key findings: (i) Current VLMs exhibit limited font recognition capabilities, with many state-of-the-art models failing to achieve satisfactory performance and being easily affected by the stroop effect introduced by textual information. (ii) Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provide minimal benefits in improving font recognition accuracy across different VLMs. (iii) Attention analysis sheds light on the inherent limitations of VLMs in capturing semantic features.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for understanding how diffusion models can learn disentangled representations. Within this framework, we establish identifiability conditions for general disentangled latent variable models, analyze training dynamics, and derive sample complexity bounds for disentangled latent subspace models. To validate our theory, we conduct disentanglement experiments across diverse tasks and modalities, including subspace recovery in latent subspace Gaussian mixture models, image colorization, image denoising, and voice conversion for speech classification. Additionally, our experiments show that training strategies inspired by our theory, such as style guidance regularization, consistently enhance disentanglement performance.

Abstract: Advances in neural operators have introduced discretization invariant surrogate models for PDEs on general geometries, yet many approaches struggle to encode local geometric structure and variable domains efficiently. We introduce enf2enf, a neural field approach for predicting steady-state PDEs with geometric variability. Our method encodes geometries into latent features anchored at specific spatial locations, preserving locality throughout the network. These local representations are combined with global parameters and decoded to continuous physical fields, enabling effective modeling of complex shape variations. Experiments on aerodynamic and structural benchmarks demonstrate competitive or superior performance compared to graph-based, neural operator, and recent neural field methods, with real-time inference and efficient scaling to high-resolution meshes.

<title>Plan-R1: Safe and Feasible Trajectory Planning as Language Modeling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17659</link>

Abstract: Safe and feasible trajectory planning is critical for real-world autonomous driving systems. However, existing learning-based planners rely heavily on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting undesirable behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a two-stage trajectory planning framework that decouples principle alignment from behavior learning. In the first stage, a general trajectory predictor is pre-trained on expert data to capture diverse, human-like driving behaviors. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with rule-based rewards using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), explicitly aligning ego planning with principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. This two-stage paradigm retains human-like behaviors while enhancing safety awareness and discarding undesirable patterns from demonstrations. Furthermore, we identify a key limitation of directly applying GRPO to planning: group-wise normalization erases cross-group scale differences, causing rare, high-variance safety-violation groups to have similar advantages as abundant low-variance safe groups, thereby suppressing optimization for safety-critical objectives. To address this, we propose Variance-Decoupled GRPO (VD-GRPO), which replaces normalization with centering and fixed scaling to preserve absolute reward magnitudes, ensuring that safety-critical objectives remain dominant throughout training. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance, particularly in realistic reactive settings.

<title>Mobi-$\pi$: Mobilizing Your Robot Learning Policy</title>

arXiv:2505.23692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. We propose a novel approach for policy mobilization that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. To understand policy mobilization in more depth, we also introduce the Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, and (3) visualization tools for analysis. In both our developed simulation task suite and the real world, we show that our approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Interactable digital twins of such objects have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. Unfortunately, current methods to digitize articulated real-world objects require carefully captured data, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable acquisition. We focus on motion analysis and part-level segmentation of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to obtain at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is challenging due to simultaneous object and camera motion and significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iTACO: a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories that is 20$\times$ larger than available in prior work. We then compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Our experiments show that iTACO outperforms existing articulated object digital twin methods on both synthetic and real casually captured RGBD videos.

Abstract: Neural implicit shape representation has drawn significant attention in recent years due to its smoothness, differentiability, and topological flexibility. However, directly modeling the shape of a neural implicit surface, especially as the zero-level set of a neural signed distance function (SDF), with sparse geometric control is still a challenging task. Sparse input shape control typically includes 3D curve networks or, more generally, 3D curve sketches, which are unstructured and cannot be connected to form a curve network, and therefore more difficult to deal with. While 3D curve networks or curve sketches provide intuitive shape control, their sparsity and varied topology pose challenges in generating high-quality surfaces to meet such curve constraints. In this paper, we propose NeuVAS, a variational approach to shape modeling using neural implicit surfaces constrained under sparse input shape control, including unstructured 3D curve sketches as well as connected 3D curve networks. Specifically, we introduce a smoothness term based on a functional of surface curvatures to minimize shape variation of the zero-level set surface of a neural SDF. We also develop a new technique to faithfully model G0 sharp feature curves as specified in the input curve sketches. Comprehensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the significant advantages of our method.

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is available at https://crystalsixone.github.io/vln_pe.github.io/.

arXiv:2507.14270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to $96.69\%$ test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

arXiv:2507.17897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: VLMs, hallucination detection, next-token probabilities, ML models, reliability

Summary: 
Hallucinations, misalignments between visual content and generated text in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can compromise their reliability. Existing methods for detecting hallucinations are computationally intensive and increase latency. This paper proposes an efficient on-the-fly hallucination detection method using next-token probabilities (NTPs) to quantify model uncertainty. A dataset of human-annotated statements is used to validate the NTP-based lightweight method, showing that high uncertainty (low NTP values) correlates with hallucinations. Traditional ML models utilizing NTP-based features achieve comparable performance to strong VLMs, with linguistic NTPs further enhancing detection. Combining hallucination prediction scores from VLMs with NTP-based models improves overall performance. This study introduces a simple, lightweight solution to enhance VLM reliability, offering a promising approach for improving the accuracy of text generation models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs. One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations. To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs. Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework for offline handwritten signature verification using Riemannian geometry and quasi-synthetic data generation. Traditional methods rely on real-world datasets for training, but this framework generates synthetic data in the Symmetric Positive Definite matrix space. By creating synthetic writers and their properties through Riemannian Gaussian Mixture sampling, positive and negative synthetic populations are generated. A metric learning framework is applied using similar and dissimilar points in the SPD space, and the approach is tested on real-world signature datasets representing Western and Asian writing styles. Results show low error rates, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed quasi-synthetic approach for writer-independent signature verification systems. This highlights the potential of generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces for improving signature verification accuracy. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task, particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification systems.

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g., 1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation, distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image (without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream 4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images. This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications.

Summary:
Contrastive Learning (CL) framework is introduced to improve breast cancer detection using deep learning methods. Traditional computer-aided detection systems rely on image analysis, but deep learning is more effective. The challenge lies in the limited availability of large labeled datasets for training deep learning models. By using a semi-supervised CL approach and training Resnet-50 on unlabeled mammogram data with similarity index, the model achieves high accuracy. Various augmentations and transformations are applied to enhance performance. The model is fine-tuned on a small set of labeled data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods with a 96.7% accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning (CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7% accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

Summary:
Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly being used for text and image processing tasks due to their ability to generalize across domains. They have shown promise in automated quality inspection in manufacturing, allowing for zero-shot learning and simplifying the labeling process. However, recent tests have shown that while these models perform well on public benchmark datasets, they struggle with real-world industrial image data. This discrepancy highlights the challenges of applying FMs to specific industrial applications and the importance of testing them on custom data. The ability of FMs to generalize may not always translate to real-world scenarios, emphasizing the need for further research and development to improve their performance in practical settings. Overall, while FMs have shown great potential in various applications, including quality inspection, addressing their limitations on real-world data is crucial for their successful implementation in industrial settings.

arXiv:2509.20479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across many products would save significant efforts during model setup and implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform well on public benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy, improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules, such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can be performed efficiently in the NS.

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

<div> Keywords: InstructVTON, virtual try-on, styling control, image segmentation, Vision Language Models<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces InstructVTON, an interactive virtual try-on system that allows detailed styling control using natural language instructions. It simplifies the virtual try-on process by automating binary mask generation based on user-provided images and text instructions. This eliminates the need for precise mask drawing and enables the system to handle complex styling scenarios that traditional masking-based models struggle with. By leveraging Vision Language Models and image segmentation, InstructVTON enhances the user experience and improves the overall outcome of virtual try-on sessions. The system can be integrated with existing virtual try-on models to achieve top-tier results while providing users with more control and flexibility in their styling choices.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve). InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask, and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

Summary: 
The article introduces DeepAFRNet, a deep learning model designed to effectively recognize altered fingerprint samples, critical in applications like border control and forensics. Using a VGG16 backbone for feature extraction and cosine similarity for comparison, DeepAFRNet achieves high accuracies of 96.7%, 98.76%, and 99.54% across different difficulty levels. The model's performance is highly sensitive to threshold selection, with a sharp degradation in accuracy when thresholds are relaxed. By utilizing real altered samples and evaluating with detailed metrics, DeepAFRNet overcomes previous limitations of synthetic alterations and limited verification protocols, demonstrating its readiness for real-world deployment where both security and recognition resilience are essential. <div>

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of 96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72 sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent, underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Summary:<br />
The study explores the use of attention maps generated by a pre-trained Vision Transformer to enhance bimanual robotic manipulation. These attention maps, derived from DINOv2, are translated into voxel representations and integrated into a behavior cloning policy. The incorporation of attention-guided featurization into a voxel-based policy leads to significant performance improvements across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual benchmark. The results show an average absolute improvement of 8.2% and a relative gain of 21.9%. This approach demonstrates the potential of leveraging attention mechanisms in pre-trained models to enhance robotic manipulation tasks, showcasing the benefits of integrating higher-level semantic cues at the voxel level to improve overall performance. <div>

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy. When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2% and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual benchmark.

Summary: <br />
This study evaluates various real-time object detectors for blueberry detection in challenging natural environments. A dataset of 661 canopy images with 85,879 labelled blueberry instances is used for evaluation. YOLOv12m and RT-DETRv2-X are found to be the most accurate models, with mAP@50 scores of 93.3% and 93.6% respectively. Mid-sized models show a good balance between accuracy and speed. Fine-tuning with Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning on unlabeled data results in accuracy improvements, with RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the highest mAP@50 score of 94.8%. Further research on SSL is recommended for better utilization of cross-domain unlabeled data. The dataset and software programs used in the study are publicly available for further research. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once) (v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families, consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of 1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in 2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support further research.

<div> Keywords: Breast cancer screening, mammography, deep learning, Mini-DDSM dataset, region-of-interest augmentation

Summary:
Breast cancer screening using mammography is crucial for early detection and reducing mortality rates. Deep learning has shown promise in automating mammogram interpretation, but limited-resolution datasets and small sample sizes have hindered performance. This study revisited the Mini-DDSM dataset and implemented a lightweight region-of-interest (ROI) augmentation strategy during training. This strategy involved replacing full images with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed bounding-box bank, with optional jitter for increased variability. The results showed modest improvements in average ROC-AUC with ROI augmentation, indicating that simple data-centric ROI strategies can enhance mammography classification without the need for additional labels or architectural changes. Inference-time cost remained unchanged, making this augmentation technique efficient for training purposes. 

<br /><br />Summary: Breast cancer screening is important for early detection, and deep learning has potential in automating mammogram interpretation. The study introduced a region-of-interest augmentation strategy on the Mini-DDSM dataset, leading to modest improvements in average ROC-AUC without the need for additional labels or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset (9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest (ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Summary: <br /> 
This study focuses on utilizing mirror reflections in everyday environments to provide stereo information in a single capture. By treating the reflection as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation to create a physically valid virtual camera, the researchers enable direct generation of virtual views within the pixel domain. This approach simplifies the imaging process and allows for robust 3D reconstruction using feed-forward models. The framework also includes a symmetric-aware loss for refining pose estimation, taking advantage of the geometric symmetry introduced by mirrors. The method is adaptable to dynamic scenes with mirror reflections, facilitating efficient per-frame geometry recovery. The researchers conduct extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data, showcasing the effectiveness of their approach in achieving accurate and generalizable 3D reconstruction. <div>

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process, making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

Summary:
Facadetrack is a framework for assessing building-level occupancy after disasters using street-level imagery. It links panoramic video to parcels, identifies facade attributes, and uses interpretable cues to determine habitability. The framework includes two decision strategies: a one-stage rule and a two-stage design. Evaluation on post-Hurricane Helene surveys shows that the two-stage approach achieves high precision, recall, and F-1 score compared to the baseline. It provides auditable and scalable occupancy assessments that can be integrated into geospatial and emergency management workflows. The framework's intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics help identify and address residual errors, enabling targeted quality control. Overall, FacadeTrack offers a transparent and effective tool for triage, inspections, and resource allocation post-disaster. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections, utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level, language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

Summary:
Humans can recognize social interactions from simple moving shapes, with semantic representations complementing visual features. Study 1 revealed varied human responses when labeling animations based on their impressions of moving shapes. Study 2 assessed the representational geometry of 27 social interactions using human similarity judgments and compared them with model predictions based on visual features, labels, and semantic embeddings. The results showed that semantic models, particularly verb-based embeddings extracted from descriptions, provided additional insight into human similarity judgments beyond visual features. This suggests that the semantic structure of social interactions plays a key role in enhancing social perception in simple displays, acting as a bridge between visual and abstract representations.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features, labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best. These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract representations.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel framework for Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) called EGS, aimed at improving cross-domain generalization in matching images from different viewpoints. The proposed framework incorporates an E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable features under viewpoint shifts and rotations, enhancing robustness to appearance variations. Additionally, a graph structure with a virtual super-node is utilized to enforce global-local consistency in establishing reliable correspondences capturing both global and local scene details. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, EGS consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL. This framework addresses the key challenges of robustness under appearance variations and establishing reliable correspondences, contributing significantly to the field of geo-localization. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

<div> Keywords: infrared small target detection, deep learning, edge enhancement, semantic modeling, attention mechanism

Summary:
The paper introduces a Dual-Path Edge Network for infrared small target detection, addressing the challenge of capturing high-resolution spatial details and robust semantic context simultaneously. The network consists of two processing paths: one using Bidirectional Interaction Module with local and global self-attention for multi-scale feature dependencies, and another employing Multi-Edge Refiner with cascaded Taylor finite difference operators for fine-grained edge enhancement. The global attention mechanism integrates long-range semantic relationships for scene understanding while the edge refinement module enables precise edge localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes. The method combines structural semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework, providing a promising solution for precise infrared small target detection and localization. <div>
arXiv:2509.20701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms, which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions, overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals, and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of 1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6 types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics: multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions. Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting.

Summary: <br />
Maritime object detection is crucial for safety and surveillance, but faces challenges due to limited annotated data and poor generalization. Neptune-X addresses these challenges with a data-centric approach that combines synthetic data generation and task-aware sample selection. The X-to-Maritime generative model synthesizes realistic maritime scenes, with a Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module enhancing visual fidelity. Attribute-correlated Active Sampling selects synthetic samples based on task relevance. The Maritime Generation Dataset provides a diverse set of semantic conditions for benchmarking. Extensive experiments show that Neptune-X outperforms existing models, especially in challenging open-sea environments. This framework improves detection accuracy and sets a new benchmark in maritime scene synthesis. The code for Neptune-X is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.20745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance, and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy, particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code is available at https://github.com/gy65896/Neptune-X.

The STELLA system is introduced as an end-to-end CBN pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping missions. It incorporates a crater detector, identification module, pose solver, and orbit determination backend. To test STELLA, the CRESENT-365 dataset simulates a year-long lunar mapping mission with realistic imaging conditions. Experimental results show that STELLA maintains high position and attitude accuracy across various viewing angles, illumination conditions, and lunar latitudes. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping context, offering insights for future missions.

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration, with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

<div> Alignment, representational space, vision-language models, semantic code, exemplar aggregation

Summary: 
The study explores the convergence of deep vision-only and language-only models, discovering that alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers of both types, indicating a shift from modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. Alignment is robust to appearance changes but collapses when semantics are altered, emphasizing the significance of a truly semantic shared code. Human preferences for image-caption matches are reflected in the embedding spaces across all model pairs, showing that models capture fine-grained semantic distinctions. Bidirectional alignment is observed when multiple captions correspond to a single image. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across exemplars enhances alignment rather than blurring detail. Overall, the results demonstrate that unimodal networks develop a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens when aggregating exemplars. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios, and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered (e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-image diffusion models, object insertion, geometric control, style consistency, 3D generation models

Summary: 
FreeInsert is a new framework that addresses limitations in existing image editing methods by allowing for customized object insertion into images without the need for extensive training. It leverages 3D geometric information to provide precise geometric control over inserted objects and ensure style consistency with the background. By converting objects into 3D and performing interactive editing at that level, users can manipulate shape and view before re-rendering the object into a 2D image from a specified perspective. This process combines geometric controls with style and content controls achieved through diffusion adapters, resulting in edited images that are both geometrically controlled and style-consistent. The framework aims to enhance the realism and customization capabilities of image editing tasks, offering a more intuitive and efficient approach for personalized image composition.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose \textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information. Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled, style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

Summary:
- The paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG) in medical image segmentation, where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled data in addition to training and testing sets.
- Existing SSDG methods struggle under such domain shifts due to inaccurate pseudolabels.
- The proposed dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework is tailored for CD-SSDG, utilizing feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks to improve generalizability.
- Feature-level supervision helps address inaccurate pseudo supervision caused by domain shifts, leveraging complementary supervision from the feature space.
- Integration of distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks in each sub-model enhances domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevents model collapse. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing, addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However, conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG. Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

Summary: DEIMv2 is an enhanced version of the DEIM training framework for real-time DETRs, incorporating DINOv3 features and spanning eight model sizes. For larger variants, DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones are used with a Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA) to enhance detection with multi-scale features. Ultra-lightweight models utilize HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning. DEIMv2 achieves a superior performance-cost trade-off across various scenarios. The largest model, DEIMv2-X, surpasses prior models with fewer parameters. DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model to exceed 50 AP on COCO, and even the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico matches YOLOv10-Nano in performance with significantly fewer parameters. <div>
arXiv:2509.20787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features, resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets. Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters, surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model (9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer parameters.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

Summary:  
The article introduces a new method called Federated Domain Generalization with Domain-Specific Soft Prompts Generation (FedDSPG) for handling federated domain generalization tasks. This method leverages generative models to generate domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain during training, integrating content and domain knowledge to enhance model generalization. In the inference phase, the generator produces DSPs for unseen target domains, aiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. The proposed FedDSPG method surpasses existing strong baselines in federated domain generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results in evaluations across multiple public datasets. This approach addresses the challenge of domain shift among clients in federated learning, offering improved computational efficiency and enhanced generalization ability for downstream tasks. <div>

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG) methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports, LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations. These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to 95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and clinical decision support.

Summary: 
Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have become essential for various video understanding tasks, with advancements in frame sampling techniques improving their performance over time. However, the safety of prompt-guided sampling, the latest sampling strategy, has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, the authors introduce PoisonVID, the first black-box poisoning attack targeting prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. By leveraging a closed-loop optimization method, PoisonVID optimizes a universal perturbation to manipulate harmful frame relevance scores, ultimately compromising the sampling mechanism. The attack, guided by a depiction set created from paraphrased harmful descriptions using a shadow VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, GPT-4o-mini, achieves high success rates across different prompt-guided strategies and VideoLLMs. The results emphasize the need for further research on developing secure and advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs. <div>

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

The paper introduces a novel regularization method called Game of Regularizer (GoR) for balancing task-specific and knowledge distillation objectives in compressed AI models. By dynamically adjusting loss weighting with only two trainable parameters, GoR minimizes conflicts between supervision signals, enhances convergence, and improves performance of small quantized models (SQMs). Experimental results across image classification, object detection, and large language models demonstrate GoR's superiority over existing methods, enabling faster inference on low-power edge devices without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the paper introduces QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework using multiple teacher models, which can potentially outperform full-precision models under optimal conditions. The proposed approach provides a robust solution for deploying compressed AI models in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals, improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models (SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for real-world deployment.

Summary:
The 2017 LifeCLEF plant identification challenge focused on automated plant identification systems using deep learning and large datasets. With 10,000 plant species mainly in Europe and North America, the challenge aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of training datasets from institutional sources versus those collected online. The test dataset was created from the Pl@ntNet mobile app, which collects plant image queries globally. Despite the majority of plant species lacking pictures, the challenge assessed the potential of using a large, noisy web dataset compared to a smaller expert-verified dataset. Participants employed various approaches and systems to tackle the challenge, highlighting the need for accurate labeling in training datasets. The analysis of the challenge outcomes provides valuable insights into the performance of different training strategies. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that collects millions of plant image queries all over the world.

<div> plant counting, agriculture, vision-based approach, TasselNetV4, cross-species counting

Summary:<br /><br />Accurate plant counting is crucial for agriculture, offering insights into crop yield prediction, density assessment, and phenotype quantification. While previous methods focus on species-specific counting, the new TasselNetV4 model shifts towards cross-species counting, leveraging the dynamic nature of plants. By combining local counting and an extract-and-match approach, TasselNetV4 outperforms existing models in counting plants across various scales and scenes. The model, based on a vision transformer and multi-branch box-aware local counters, demonstrates superior counting performance and efficiency on challenging datasets like PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia. TasselNetV4 is positioned as a foundational model for cross-species plant counting, providing a versatile solution for diverse agricultural needs. <div>

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification. Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant. However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision, we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting, from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting.

<div> Keywords: Optical coherence tomography, retinal diseases, semi-supervised learning, biomarker segmentation, anatomical constraints

Summary:
This article introduces a novel semi-supervised model for segmentation of retinal biomarkers in optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, with a focus on lesions and layers in diseases like age-related macular degeneration. The model incorporates a biomarker topology engine to ensure anatomically correct segmentations, enabling bidirectional influence between layers and lesions. By disentangling spatial and style factors, the model produces more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion segmentation while strictly enforcing lesion location relative to layers. Evaluation on various datasets demonstrates superior performance in both lesion and layer segmentation, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods. The model shows the potential of using anatomical constraints in semi-supervised learning for accurate and robust retinal biomarker segmentation, even when trained on partially annotated data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal biomarker segmentation.

Summary: 
The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge assesses plant identification methods on a large scale using over 110K images of 1000 plant species in West Europe. In the 2016 edition, the challenge included open-set recognition, where systems had to handle unknown categories. Participants aimed to reject false positive classification hits caused by unknown classes. This overview examines the resources, assessments, approaches, and outcomes of the challenge. The task required robust classification and rejection of unknown categories, enhancing the need for sophisticated image recognition systems in biodiversity monitoring scenarios. <div>

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating 1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

<div> knowledge-based visual question answering, large language models, SCRA-VQA, image caption, reasoning ability

Summary: 
SCRA-VQA is proposed to address the limitations of using large language models (LLMs) for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA). The model employs a pre-trained visual language model to convert images into captions, generating contextual examples while summarizing and reordering the captions to exclude irrelevant information. This caption-rerank process enhances the LLM's understanding of image information and questions, improving reasoning ability and task adaptability. SCRA-VQA achieves high performance on challenging KB-VQA datasets, OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, with accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6% respectively. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated without the need for expensive end-to-end training, making it a valuable tool for acquiring high-quality knowledge in visual question answering tasks. The code for SCRA-VQA is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at https://github.com/HubuKG/SCRA-VQA.

<title>The Unanticipated Asymmetry Between Perceptual Optimization and Assessment</title>

<div> fidelity objective, adversarial objective, perceptual optimization, image quality assessment, discriminator design

Summary:
Perceptual optimization in image generation is driven by both fidelity and adversarial objectives. However, there is a misalignment between fidelity metrics effective in image quality assessment (IQA) and their effectiveness in optimization. This mismatch becomes more pronounced under adversarial training. Additionally, discriminators play a crucial role in artifact suppression during optimization, but their learned representations offer limited benefits for IQA model initialization. When it comes to discriminator design, patch-level and convolutional architectures outperform vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives in faithful detail reconstruction. Understanding the relationship between loss function design and IQA transferability is key to improving perceptual optimization methods. This study sheds light on the importance of discriminator design in shaping optimization outcomes and offers insights for more principled approaches in the field. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives. These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled approaches to perceptual optimization.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets. Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods, particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in advancing VQA tasks.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new method called Nuclear Diffusion for video restoration by integrating low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling. Traditional methods like robust principal component analysis (RPCA) have limitations in capturing the variability in real video data due to the sparsity assumption. Nuclear Diffusion is applied to cardiac ultrasound dehazing and shows improved performance in contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic) compared to RPCA. By combining model-based temporal modeling with deep generative priors, Nuclear Diffusion offers high-fidelity video restoration. This hybrid framework addresses the challenges posed by structured noise and background artifacts in video sequences, providing a more effective solution for accurate analysis and restoration. <div>
arXiv:2509.20886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video restoration.

Summary: 
The paper addresses the challenge of detecting synthetic images that are becoming increasingly realistic due to advanced models like VAEs, GANs, and LDMs. The study focuses on two main artifact types introduced during the image generation process: latent distribution deviations and decoding-induced smoothing effects. By leveraging local pixel dependencies rooted in Markov Random Fields, the researchers propose FerretNet, a lightweight neural network with 1.1M parameters designed for efficient synthetic image detection. This model reconstructs synthetic images using neighboring pixel information to identify disruptions in texture continuity and edge coherence. Through extensive experiments on a 4-class ProGAN dataset and a benchmark comprising 22 generative models, FerretNet achieves an impressive average accuracy of 97.1%, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%. <div>

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2) decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies (LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22 generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

<br />Summary: <br />
Conceptual models like Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have been successful in enhancing interpretability for image classification by utilizing human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models to video data poses challenges due to temporal dependencies. To address this, MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework) introduces a transformer-inspired architectural design for video classification, enabling the analysis of sequences of arbitrary length. Within videos, concepts represent semantic entities that recur over time to describe actions collectively. MoTIF enables the evaluation of global concept importance, local concept relevance within specific windows, and concept evolution over time. Results show the transferability of the concept-based modeling approach to video data, providing insights into concept contributions within temporal contexts and maintaining competitive performance. The code for MoTIF is available on github.com/patrick-knab/MoTIF. <div>

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos, which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes, or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Summary: 
This paper discusses the use of particle filters for 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements, particularly in the context of safety-critical surveillance tasks like drone-based wildfire monitoring. The method proposed in the study is shown to be effective for both single and multiple target scenarios, using a combination of camera poses and image segments. The particle filter approach is found to be suitable for situations involving distant objects or limited computational resources, where other solutions may not be feasible. The study demonstrates that the proposed method, independent of the detection method used, can effectively facilitate drone-based wildfire monitoring with the integration of a pre-existing image segmentation model. <div>

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image segmentation model.

It addresses the challenges of high spatial resolution and diverse object scales by integrating localized and global scanning in its model. The SwinMamba framework captures both fine-grained details through local scanning in the initial stages and broader contextual information through global scanning in later stages. By using overlapping shifted windows, SwinMamba enhances information exchange between regions, leading to more robust feature integration across the entire image. Experimental results on the LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms existing methods, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.<br /><br />Summary: SwinMamba is a novel framework that combines local and global scanning to improve semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery.

arXiv:2509.20918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts. To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details, while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

<div> Keywords: Computational pathology, whole slide images, pack-based MIL framework, batched training, attention-driven downsampler

Summary: 
Computational pathology is crucial for tasks like cancer diagnosis, but the long and variable length of whole slide images poses challenges. A new pack-based multiple instance learning framework is proposed to address these issues. This framework packs variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones for efficient batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. A residual branch creates a hyperslide from discarded features for multi-slide supervision, and an attention-driven downsampler reduces redundancy in features. By focusing on data challenges in computational pathology, the proposed approach achieves an 8% accuracy improvement with only 12% of the training time on the PANDA(UNI) dataset. The findings suggest that tackling data challenges in computational pathology can have a significant impact in the era of foundation models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models. The code is https://github.com/FangHeng/PackMIL

Summary: <br />
Generating physically plausible human motion is essential for character animation and virtual reality applications. Traditional approaches use a simulator-based motion projection layer, leading to high computational costs due to its sequential nature. SimDiff introduces a novel method by integrating environment parameters directly into the denoising process, allowing for efficient generation of physically plausible motions. This approach eliminates the need for repeated simulator calls during inference, providing fine-grained control over physical coefficients. SimDiff also demonstrates successful generalization to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, showcasing compositional generalization. <div>

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free, within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters (e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently, without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating compositional generalization.

<div> Keywords: vision models, robustness, Gaussian noise, design patterns, theoretical analysis

Summary:<br /><br />
The study focuses on the robustness of vision models against additive Gaussian noise and how specific architectural design choices impact this robustness. By evaluating over a thousand pretrained vision models, the researchers identified four key design patterns for improved robustness: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers over CLIP ViTs. Theoretical analysis provided insights into the causal mechanisms behind these findings. Low-pass stem kernels were shown to attenuate noise, while downsampling and average pooling were found to suppress noise effectively. The vulnerability of CLIP ViTs was explained through a pixel-space Lipschitz bound. These results offer interpretable modules for understanding robustness in vision models and provide practical guidelines for designing models that are more resilient to Gaussian noise. <div>

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings, converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.

<div> Keywords: Scene graphs, surgery, data divide, graph neural networks, intelligent systems <br />
Summary: <br />
Scene graphs play a crucial role in decoding surgical environments, with rapid growth in research. However, a 'data divide' exists between internal-view and external-view research, leading to a translational research gap. Methodologically, the field has progressed from basic graph neural networks to specialized models that outperform general vision-language models in surgical applications. Scene graphs are now essential for tasks such as workflow recognition, safety monitoring, and surgical simulation. Challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation are being addressed, with emerging techniques showing promise. Surgical scene graphs are becoming a vital technology for enhancing safety, efficiency, and training in surgery. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery, charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions. Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide': internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically, the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques. Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and training.

Summary: 
An automated vision-based system has been developed for detecting and classifying defects in laser power meter sensor coatings. The system utilizes an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that learns normal coating distribution patterns from "good" sensor images to detect various defect types without the need for extensive labeled datasets.

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961. The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device implementation.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy, multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER (Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3) aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for research.

<title>An Adaptor for Triggering Semi-Supervised Learning to Out-of-Box Serve Deep Image Clustering</title>

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining, clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image clustering methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact, quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation. However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition. Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements. We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud. Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry, laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species and sensor modality.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity. As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at https://github.com/YuzunoKawori/Mambo.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward, label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging, and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting strategies are most prone to bias.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual annotations.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks, particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs. non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT) technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97% (facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs, with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model resilience to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual fidelity and editability.

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP) mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal perception.

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists' workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories (e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g., density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept learning.

<title>MOSS-ChatV: Reinforcement Learning with Process Reasoning Reward for Video Temporal Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct, undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation. MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2, confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

<title>The Unwinnable Arms Race of AI Image Detection</title>

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

<title>WAVECLIP: Wavelet Tokenization for Adaptive-Resolution CLIP</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

<title>Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy</title>

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4 million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88% preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions. The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions. Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

<title>Sigma: Semantically Informative Pre-training for Skeleton-based Sign Language Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21223</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance between local details and global context, with models either focusing too narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3) inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises agreements across different levels of paired features from different modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution for SLU.

<title>Evaluating the Evaluators: Metrics for Compositional Text-to-Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21227</link>

arXiv:2509.21227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation. Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment. These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models in generation.

<title>SlideMamba: Entropy-Based Adaptive Fusion of GNN and Mamba for Enhanced Representation Learning in Digital Pathology</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21239</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images, Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization. However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST, show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST, demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model attention that better reflects human intuition.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction, anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches. Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research domains.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs). However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs. To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP, which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture. Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate reasoning than the previous works.

<title>Hallucination as an Upper Bound: A New Perspective on Text-to-Image Evaluation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations. This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

<title>Every Subtlety Counts: Fine-grained Person Independence Micro-Action Recognition via Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

arXiv:2509.21261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under fine-grained conditions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance, misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages, fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation, outperforming previous baselines.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints. Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake, noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models, enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in reconstruction performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty, and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase. (3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales, establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition, we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/LengSicong/MMR1.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.

<title>Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image Composition?</title>

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

<title>Quantized Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer</title>

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and 2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantVGGT.

<title>NewtonGen: Physics-Consistent and Controllable Text-to-Video Generation via Neural Newtonian Dynamics</title>

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances, state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control.

<title>SD3.5-Flash: Distribution-Guided Distillation of Generative Flows</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21318</link>

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment. Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly accessible for practical deployment.

<title>BlockFUL: Enabling Unlearning in Blockchained Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper, we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead, thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2 models.

<title>SceneWeaver: All-in-One 3D Scene Synthesis with an Extensible and Self-Reflective Agent</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20414</link>

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

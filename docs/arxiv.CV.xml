<div> Keywords: real-time reconstruction, dynamic driving scenes, scene flow, 4D dynamic scenes, novel view synthesis

Summary: 
DrivingScene proposes a framework for real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes using only two consecutive surround-view images. The framework utilizes a lightweight residual flow network to predict non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera and models dynamics via scene flow. A coarse-to-fine training paradigm is introduced to improve stability. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the method generates high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds in real-time, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis. <div>

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online, feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core, M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight (HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for motion-centric video captioning.

<div> Keywords: Deep Learning, Automatic Target Recognition, Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR simulators, ATR models

Summary:<br /><br />This work focuses on training Deep Learning models for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using synthetic data from SAR simulators. The study evaluates the impact of simulation paradigms on ATR performance and proposes a novel approach by combining two SAR simulators, MOCEM and Salsa, to generate diverse synthetic datasets for training. The ATR models trained using the synthetic datasets achieved nearly 88% accuracy on real measurements from the MSTAR dataset. This approach addresses the challenge of limited labeled real measurements by leveraging the flexibility of simulation environments while taking into account the limitations of synthetic data. By integrating different simulation paradigms, the proposed method showcases improved ATR performance on SAR imagery, demonstrating the potential of hybrid simulation approaches for advancing ATR technology in radar imaging applications.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.24768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However, simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

Summary:
- The study introduces a machine learning-based framework for evaluating uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds.
- The framework uses ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, trained on a real-world dataset to predict point-level errors.
- Results show that both RF and XGBoost models effectively capture the relationship between geometric features and uncertainty.
- Key geometric characteristics such as elevation variation, point density, and local structural complexity are identified as significant in predicting uncertainty.

arXiv:2510.24773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data, which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage. Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty, achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation, providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

<br />
Summary: 
This study introduces a new multimodal diagnostic approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using eye-tracking and facial features. By integrating these two modalities through a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM) and Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), the framework aims to improve AD detection accuracy. A synchronized multimodal dataset with AD patients and healthy controls was used to evaluate the proposed method. Results show that the framework outperforms traditional methods, achieving 95.11% classification accuracy in distinguishing AD from HC. The CEFAM and DACM facilitate adaptive and discriminative multimodal representation learning by capturing inter-modal interactions and fine-grained directional facial features. The study highlights the importance of modeling inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions for improved diagnostic performance in AD detection. This approach offers promise for enabling timely intervention and slowing disease progression through accurate AD diagnosis. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.24777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions.

Summary: A new method called efficient post-training quantization (PTQ) has been proposed for high-fidelity Codec Avatar models used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments. This method enables low-precision execution without compromising output quality and is complemented by a custom hardware accelerator designed for VR devices. The ESCA framework combines PTQ and the hardware accelerator to optimize PCA inference on edge VR platforms.

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based generative models. However, these models impose significant computational demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests, satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices, opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

Summary:
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and vision models have different learning patterns for graph understanding.
- Existing benchmarks do not fully evaluate global graph properties like humans do.
- The GraphAbstract benchmark assesses models' ability to recognize organizational archetypes, detect symmetry, sense connectivity strength, and identify critical elements.
- Vision models outperform GNNs in tasks requiring holistic structural understanding and are generalizable across varying graph scales.
- GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and deteriorate with increasing graph size.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.24788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing, fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding, particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

It combines linear feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) framework. Dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the GCN loss function enhances classification in multi-view data.

Experimental results on benchmark image datasets show that RSGSLM outperforms existing semi-supervised learning methods in multi-view contexts. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.24791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii) correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

Summary:
PISA-Bench is introduced as a new multilingual benchmark for vision-language models, derived from expert-created PISA tests in over six languages. The dataset includes human-extracted instructions, questions, answer options, and images, providing high-quality examples for assessment. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models shows that small models struggle with high test scores, especially on non-English splits and tasks involving spatial reasoning. The release of PISA-Bench aims to advance research in multilingual multimodal reasoning and provide a valuable resource for future studies in this field. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.24792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models (<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges, this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design, focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3) Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications, delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research.

<br />
Summary: 
The study explores conflict adaptation in vision-language models (VLMs) using a sequential Stroop task. Most VLMs exhibit behaviors consistent with conflict adaptation, suggesting the recruitment of cognitive control. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B, revealing partially overlapping supernodes for text and color in both early and late layers. The relative sizes of these supernodes align with the automaticity asymmetry between reading and color naming in humans. Additionally, a conflict-modulated supernode in layers 24-25 is identified, with its ablation significantly increasing Stroop errors while minimally affecting congruent trials. This research provides insights into the neural mechanisms underlying conflict adaptation in VLMs and sheds light on the representational basis of cognitive control in artificial intelligence models. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.24804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial. This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource, is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13 vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B. Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors while minimally affecting congruent trials.

<div> Keywords: lightweight, retrieval-augmented, image caption, visual prompt, feature fusion<br />
Summary: <br />
- The article introduces the $DualCap$ model, which enhances visual representation in image captioning by generating visual prompts from retrieved similar images.
- $DualCap$ utilizes dual retrieval mechanisms: image-to-text for text prompts and image-to-image for visually analogous scenes, bridging the semantic gap in lightweight retrieval-augmented models.
- Salient keywords and phrases from captions of visually similar scenes are used to capture key objects and details, enriching the original image features.
- A trainable feature fusion network integrates the textual features with image features, enhancing the overall captioning performance.
- The experimental results show that $DualCap$ achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters compared to existing visual-prompting captioning approaches. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.24813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically, salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning approaches.

Summary: 
This study presents a three-stage framework for assessing fish freshness using deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques. Five advanced vision architectures are fine-tuned to establish a strong baseline, and deep features from these backbones are utilized to train classical machine learning classifiers. Feature selection methods help identify a compact and informative subset of features. The proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 85.99% on the Freshness of the Fish Eyes dataset, outperforming previous studies by a significant margin.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction, challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality evaluation tasks.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks. Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore, we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs' perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring 9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new multi-round safety editing framework for text-to-image models to address safety concerns. The framework, called MR-SafeEdit, utilizes a dataset specifically designed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. A post-hoc safety editing paradigm is proposed to refine unsafe content in generated images, mimicking human cognitive processes. SafeEditor, a unified MLLM, is developed to perform multi-round safety editing on generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that SafeEditor outperforms existing safety approaches by reducing over-refusal and achieving a better balance between safety and utility in text-to-image generation. <div>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable safety-utility balance.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal emotion recognition, Hybrid network model, Adversarial autoencoders, Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model, Feature Fusion module

Summary:
A new hybrid network model, called MCIHN, is introduced for multimodal emotion recognition in human-computer interaction. This model utilizes adversarial autoencoders (AAE) for each modality to learn discriminative emotion features and reconstruct them for improved emotion class information. The Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) is then used to reduce modality discrepancies, establish emotional relationships between modalities, and generate interaction features. The Feature Fusion module (FFM) is employed for effective multimodal fusion to enhance emotion recognition performance. Experimentation on SIMS and MOSI datasets demonstrates the superior performance of MCIHN in emotion recognition tasks. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM) for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior performance.

Summary:
Flow matching has been successful, but understanding its generation process is lacking. The study adopts a denoising perspective to probe the process, connecting flow matching models to denoisers for comparison. By introducing noise and drift as perturbations, the research offers insights into the generative process's distinct phases. It provides a framework to understand when denoisers succeed or fail in the generation process, shedding light on why this is important. This work allows for a more principled and controlled approach to influencing sample generation, ultimately advancing our understanding of flow matching models. <div>
arXiv:2510.24830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift. This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

<div> deep learning, maturity estimation, agricultural automation, probabilistic learning, robotic harvesting

Summary:<br />
1. The current approach to maturity estimation in fruits and vegetables using deep learning is limited by its discrete classification nature, leading to information loss.
2. This paper proposes a new approach that views maturity estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task to capture the gradual ripening process more accurately.
3. A novel modification to the real-time object detector RT-DETRv2 with a probabilistic head is introduced to predict a continuous distribution of maturity for each detected object, including measures of uncertainty.
4. The new model maintains exceptional detection performance with a mean Average Precision of 85.6% on a large fruit dataset while providing more granular and accurate maturity assessments.
5. The probabilistic approach offers a biologically plausible representation of plant maturity and is essential for uncertainty-aware decision-making in automated agricultural systems.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.24885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector, RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts, paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in modern agriculture

Summary:
This paper explores the use of lightweight body landmark detection for recognizing isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS). While previous approaches using OpenPose for landmark extraction improved recognition performance, it hindered processing speed. By replacing OpenPose with the faster MediaPipe, accuracy decreased significantly. The study introduces landmark subset selection strategies to optimize recognition performance, achieving comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods while reducing processing time by over 5X. Additionally, spline-based imputation techniques effectively address missing landmark issues, leading to significant accuracy improvements.

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation, we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe, while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al. (2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language Recognition systems.

arXiv:2510.24902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and scalable solution for real-world deployment.

<div> Keywords: text-to-video generation, camera controls, unconventional camera motions, synthetic videos, diffusion models

Summary: 
VividCam introduces a novel training paradigm for text-to-video generative models to effectively learn complex camera motions from synthetic videos. By leveraging disentanglement strategies, the model can isolate camera motion learning from appearance artifacts, resulting in a more robust motion representation and reducing domain shift. The use of synthetic data, often consisting of basic geometries in low-poly 3D scenes, enables the synthesis of a wide range of precisely controlled and complex camera motions. This approach eliminates the need to collect a large number of realistic training videos, making the training process more efficient and cost-effective. The results of VividCam demonstrate the capability of generating original and artistic videos with unconventional camera motions, showcasing the potential for creating visually stunning content using synthetic data. The proposed paradigm opens up new possibilities for text-to-video generation models to explore and incorporate complex camera motions in their output.

arXiv:2510.24904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data. Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity.

This study introduces a probing and visualization method for understanding the inner workings of multi-view transformers like DUSt3R, focusing on their residual connections. The analysis sheds light on the development of latent states across blocks, the role of individual layers, and how they differ from methods with stronger inductive biases. The investigated variant of DUSt3R is shown to estimate correspondences that are refined with reconstructed geometry. This approach provides insights into the black-box nature of multi-view transformers, allowing for further improvements and potential applications in safety- and reliability-critical tasks.

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers' layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with reconstructed geometry.

Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM) is a novel framework proposed to address the issue of dominant modalities overshadowing others in multimodal learning. It utilizes Shapley to identify the dominant modality and modulates the loss landscape to prioritize the robustness of the model for this dominant modality. By updating weights through backpropagation of modulated gradients, M-SAM allows for robust learning while enhancing contributions from other modalities. This approach enables the model to explore and leverage complementary features, ultimately strengthening overall performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that M-SAM surpasses current optimization methods and effectively balances and improves multimodal learning outcomes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM), a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality, and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

arXiv:2510.24980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern. Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B, achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs, FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

<div> Keywords: License plate recognition, deep learning, YOLOv8, semi-supervised learning, Grounding DINO

Summary:<br /><br />Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system (ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and dust. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for license plate detection and recognition tasks, achieving a recall rate of 94% on the CENPARMI dataset and 91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system (ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and 91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model. Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules. Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms, our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

arXiv:2510.25067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models (e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition, activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to 18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new method for personalized image generation that offers precise control over facial attributes while maintaining high-fidelity facial identity preservation. The approach leverages a face recognition model to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. The model is enhanced with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, enabling clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the FFHQ dataset, the method allows for the generation of personalized images with fine-grained control over facial attributes without requiring individual fine-tuning or training data. This approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality, adaptable facial image synthesis.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free (PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$ latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture, ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality, adaptable facial image synthesis.

<div> Visual Diversity, Human-Object Interaction, Zero-shot, Prompt Learning, Region-aware<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces VDRP, a framework for Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection that addresses challenges related to visual complexity. VDRP incorporates visual diversity-aware prompt learning to tackle intra-class visual diversity, injecting group-wise visual variance and applying Gaussian perturbation for diverse visual variations of a verb. Region-aware prompts are generated by retrieving region-specific concepts from human, object, and union regions to enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the HICO-DET benchmark show that VDRP achieves state-of-the-art performance in four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively handling intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. The proposed framework provides a novel approach to improving the localization and recognition of human-object interactions in images, showcasing the potential of prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models like CLIP. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.25094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2) inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second, we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions. These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.

Summary: 
The research focuses on improving the 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments by addressing issues with existing geometric priors. The proposed method, Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting, aims to achieve smooth scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and rendering efficiency. By incorporating the Atlanta-world model and using novel implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting representations, the method ensures accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions and maintains smoothness without sacrificing efficiency. The approach includes a semantic representation to predict probability of semantic regions and structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for global surface reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method outperforms existing approaches in indoor and urban scenes, providing superior surface reconstruction quality. <div>

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Summary:
Region-CAM is a novel activation method proposed to address the limitations of conventional Class Activation Mapping (CAM) techniques in weakly supervised learning tasks. By utilizing semantic information maps (SIMs) and semantic information propagation (SIP), Region-CAM highlights a larger proportion of object regions with precise boundaries aligned closely with object edges. This approach significantly improves performance in Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) tasks, achieving 60.12% and 58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) on the PASCAL VOC datasets - a marked improvement over the original CAM. Region-CAM also excels in object localization tasks, outperforming LayerCAM with a 4.5% better performance in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1 on the ILSVRC2012 validation set. Overall, Region-CAM demonstrates superior performance and accuracy in highlighting object regions and achieving pixel-wise precise activation maps compared to traditional CAM methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.25134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions. However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and 58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set. Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3). Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead (21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil engineering datasets (<10K images) while preserving computational efficiency, providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest, simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks, including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

<br />
Summary:
Thin film interferometry is a valuable technique for measuring liquid film thickness in ophthalmology, but its clinical application faces challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles from interference patterns. Traditional methods are computationally intensive or require manual analysis, limiting real-time diagnostics. In response, a vision transformer-based approach has been developed to infer thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from interferograms. Trained on a diverse dataset, the model utilizes long-range correlations to reconstruct coherent thickness profiles in a single pass from dynamic interferograms. It outperforms conventional methods on noisy films with motion artifacts, enabling automated real-time reconstruction on standard hardware. This advancement paves the way for continuous monitoring of tear films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions like dry eye disease.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated, consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware, opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new framework called Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN) for generating CAD sequences with quantitative constraints. TGBFN operates in a continuous parameter space, handling both discrete commands and continuous parameters efficiently. By employing a guided Bayesian flow, TGBFN can control CAD properties during generation. A new dataset is constructed to evaluate TGBFN's performance, showing its superiority in generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences compared to other methods. The code for TGBFN is available for public use on GitHub, facilitating further research and application in the field of generative modeling for multi-modal data like CAD sequences. <div>

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN). For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e., discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences.

<div> Keywords: Gaussian Splatting, urban scene reconstruction, LiDAR-free, geometry priors, dense point cloud

Summary: 
$D^2GS$ is a novel LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework that addresses the challenges of acquiring accurate LiDAR data. It utilizes dense point clouds generated from multi-view metric depth predictions and optimizes them using a Progressive Pruning strategy. The framework further refines geometry and depth predictions through a Depth Enhancer that leverages diffusion priors for enhanced accuracy. Additionally, it enhances ground geometry accuracy by constraining Gaussian attributes within road regions. Experimental results on the Waymo dataset show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, even outperforming approaches using ground-truth LiDAR data. The proposed method demonstrates the potential for accurate urban scene reconstruction without the reliance on multimodal sensors, providing denser and more precise geometry priors. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.25173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs, \textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency. $\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians. In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

<div> Keyword: semantic segmentation, Extended Context-Aware Classifier, class imbalance, memory bank, teacher-student network

Summary:
The article introduces the Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) for semantic segmentation, addressing issues related to class imbalance and limited model effectiveness. The ECAC dynamically adjusts the classifier using global and local contextual information, incorporating dataset-level and image-level characteristics to improve pixel labeling precision. A memory bank is used to learn dataset-level contextual information for each class, while a teacher-student network paradigm transfers knowledge from a domain expert to enhance the classifier. Through comprehensive experiments on various datasets, including ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context, the proposed ECAC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.25174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data, this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local (image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Summary:
In this paper, a novel test-time adaptive object detection method is proposed, eliminating the need for source data and overcoming closed-set limitations. The Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework incorporates vision and language prompts for parameter-efficient adaptation. A Test-time Warm-start strategy preserves vision representation capability. An Instance Dynamic Memory module stores high-quality pseudo-labels for test samples, with Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination strategies to enhance predictions and create pseudo-labels for unlabeled images. Extensive experiments show superior performance on cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks, adapting to various target data domains and categories. The method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches and is available on GitHub for further exploration. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.25175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations. Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch. Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of critical diseases can significantly improve patient survival and reduce treatment costs. However, existing diagnostic techniques are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood clots, and cardiopulmonary abnormalities. A fine-tuned MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2% specificity. A support vector machine (SVM) with handcrafted features was employed for thermal clot detection, achieving 86.4% accuracy (AUC = 0.89) on synthetic and clinical data. For cardiopulmonary analysis, lung and heart sound datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based pre-diagnostic healthcare solutions.

<div> framework, point cloud, denoising, neural network, unsupervised<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The article presents U-CAN, an unsupervised framework for denoising point clouds captured by scanning sensors. The framework utilizes a neural network to infer a multi-step denoising path for each point in a shape or scene using a noise-to-noise matching scheme. A novel loss function enables statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations, while a consistency-aware constraint ensures denoised geometry consistency is maintained. The proposed constraint is versatile and applicable to both 3D point clouds and 2D image denoising. Evaluations against benchmark datasets show that U-CAN outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and achieves comparable results to supervised approaches in point cloud denoising, upsampling, and image denoising tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.25210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors, which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Summary:
MSF-Net is introduced as a novel framework for surface normal estimation using photometric stereo techniques. It addresses limitations of existing learning-based approaches by enhancing feature extraction at multiple stages and promoting interaction between features. By incorporating a selective update strategy and feature fusion module, MSF-Net aims to extract high-quality feature information, particularly in detailed areas like wrinkles and edges. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark demonstrate that MSF-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in surface normal estimation accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2510.25221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net, a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information, which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the accuracy of surface normal estimation.

arXiv:2510.25227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First, unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods, delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.25229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality, rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges. 1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences (Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without compromising lip-sync quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components: Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates. Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet, LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84), underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable large-scale mapping.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation (GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K (zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The code will be released here.

<title>Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation for Source-Free Domain Adaptation</title>

arXiv:2510.25279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data. Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

<title>GaTector+: A Unified Head-free Framework for Gaze Object and Gaze Following Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25301</link>

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone, which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck, we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze object detection and gaze following tasks.

<title>Seeing Clearly and Deeply: An RGBD Imaging Approach with a Bio-inspired Monocentric Design</title>

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge: conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this, we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture. Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA) updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance. PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding. Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units, allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be accessed at https://github.com/Fleeting-hyh/StreamingCoT.

<title>Informative Sample Selection Model for Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Limited Training Samples</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation, has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information, combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism, is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples. To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations. Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the unavailability of expert annotations.

arXiv:2510.25372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However, global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients, while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

arXiv:2510.25387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page: https://vrg.fel.cvut.cz/icir/.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.25440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches that rely on independent generations.

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense, metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+ with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights. Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance. ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of 0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

<title>RegionE: Adaptive Region-Aware Generation for Efficient Image Editing</title>

arXiv:2510.25590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image, while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions, we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas. For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation, we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache. Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding, which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR, and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in both quality and versatility.

<title>VFXMaster: Unlocking Dynamic Visual Effect Generation via In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media, yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task, enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a comprehensive dataset to the community.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of human emotions is critical for adaptive human-computer interaction, yet remains challenging in dynamic, conversation-like settings. This work presents a personality-aware multimodal framework that integrates eye-tracking sequences, Big Five personality traits, and contextual stimulus cues to predict both perceived and felt emotions. Seventy-three participants viewed speech-containing clips from the CREMA-D dataset while providing eye-tracking signals, personality assessments, and emotion ratings. Our neural models captured temporal gaze dynamics and fused them with trait and stimulus information, yielding consistent gains over SVM and literature baselines. Results show that (i) stimulus cues strongly enhance perceived-emotion predictions (macro F1 up to 0.77), while (ii) personality traits provide the largest improvements for felt emotion recognition (macro F1 up to 0.58). These findings highlight the benefit of combining physiological, trait-level, and contextual information to address the inherent subjectivity of emotion. By distinguishing between perceived and felt responses, our approach advances multimodal affective computing and points toward more personalized and ecologically valid emotion-aware systems.

<title>DMVFC: Deep Learning Based Functionally Consistent Tractography Fiber Clustering Using Multimodal Diffusion MRI and Functional MRI</title>

Abstract: Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial method for white matter (WM) parcellation to enable analysis of brains structural connectivity in health and disease. Current fiber clustering strategies primarily use the fiber geometric characteristics (i.e., the spatial trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, while neglecting the functional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts. There is increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using functional MRI (fMRI), providing potentially valuable multimodal information for fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence. Furthermore, microstructural features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) can be computed from dMRI as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the clusters. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), which uses joint multi-modal dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber tracts. DMVFC includes two major components: (1) a multi-view pretraining module to compute embedding features from each source of information separately, including fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional signals, and (2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine the differences of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.

Abstract: Secure and reliable medical image classification is crucial for effective patient treatment, but centralized models face challenges due to data and privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborations but struggles with heterogeneous, non-IID data and high communication costs, especially in large networks. We propose \textbf{CFL-SparseMed}, an FL approach that uses Top-k Sparsification to reduce communication overhead by transmitting only the top k gradients. This unified solution effectively addresses data heterogeneity while maintaining model accuracy. It enhances FL efficiency, preserves privacy, and improves diagnostic accuracy and patient care in non-IID medical imaging settings.

<title>CT-Less Attenuation Correction Using Multiview Ensemble Conditional Diffusion Model on High-Resolution Uncorrected PET Images</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24805</link>

Abstract: Accurate quantification in positron emission tomography (PET) is essential for accurate diagnostic results and effective treatment tracking. A major issue encountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching detectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to differentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. Typically, this correction is done with co-computed Computed Tomography (CT) imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon attenuation across the body. However, this methodology subjects patients to extra ionizing radiation exposure, suffers from potential spatial misregistration between PET/CT imaging sequences, and demands costly equipment infrastructure. Emerging advances in neural network architectures present an alternative approach via synthetic CT image synthesis. Our investigation reveals that Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can generate high quality CT images from non attenuation corrected PET images in order to correct attenuation. By utilizing all three orthogonal views from non-attenuation-corrected PET images, the DDPM approach combined with ensemble voting generates higher quality pseudo-CT images with reduced artifacts and improved slice-to-slice consistency. Results from a study of 159 head scans acquired with the Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudo-CT generation. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 32 $\pm$ 10.4 HU on the CT images and an average error of (1.48 $\pm$ 0.68)\% across all regions of interest when comparing PET images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated pseudo-CT versus the true CT.

<title>Seeing Through the MiRAGE: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess multimodal RAG.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.24949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing scenario coverage is crucial for evaluating the robustness of autonomous agents, yet existing methods rely on expensive human annotations or computationally intensive Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). These approaches are impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and efficiency constraints. To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT (Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's latent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process, learning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the need for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation. By leveraging precomputed perception features, SCOUT avoids redundant computations and enables fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation. We evaluate our method across a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios, demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis. While its performance depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels, SCOUT represents a major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems.

<title>Resi-VidTok: An Efficient and Decomposed Progressive Tokenization Framework for Ultra-Low-Rate and Lightweight Video Transmission</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25002</link>

arXiv:2510.25002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time transmission of video over wireless networks remains highly challenging, even with advanced deep models, particularly under severe channel conditions such as limited bandwidth and weak connectivity. In this paper, we propose Resi-VidTok, a Resilient Tokenization-Enabled framework designed for ultra-low-rate and lightweight video transmission that delivers strong robustness while preserving perceptual and semantic fidelity on commodity digital hardware. By reorganizing spatio--temporal content into a discrete, importance-ordered token stream composed of key tokens and refinement tokens, Resi-VidTok enables progressive encoding, prefix-decodable reconstruction, and graceful quality degradation under constrained channels. A key contribution is a resilient 1D tokenization pipeline for video that integrates differential temporal token coding, explicitly supporting reliable recovery from incomplete token sets using a single shared framewise decoder--without auxiliary temporal extractors or heavy generative models. Furthermore, stride-controlled frame sparsification combined with a lightweight decoder-side interpolator reduces transmission load while maintaining motion continuity. Finally, a channel-adaptive source--channel coding and modulation scheme dynamically allocates rate and protection according to token importance and channel condition, yielding stable quality across adverse SNRs. Evaluation results indicate robust visual and semantic consistency at channel bandwidth ratios (CBR) as low as 0.0004 and real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps, demonstrating the practicality of Resi-VidTok for energy-efficient, latency-sensitive, and reliability-critical wireless applications.

Abstract: We present a transformer-based multimodal framework for generating clinically relevant captions for MRI scans. Our system combines a DEiT-Small vision transformer as an image encoder, MediCareBERT for caption embedding, and a custom LSTM-based decoder. The architecture is designed to semantically align image and textual embeddings, using hybrid cosine-MSE loss and contrastive inference via vector similarity. We benchmark our method on the MultiCaRe dataset, comparing performance on filtered brain-only MRIs versus general MRI images against state-of-the-art medical image captioning methods including BLIP, R2GenGPT, and recent transformer-based approaches. Results show that focusing on domain-specific data improves caption accuracy and semantic alignment. Our work proposes a scalable, interpretable solution for automated medical image reporting.

Abstract: Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model. Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations. In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

<title>Feedback Alignment Meets Low-Rank Manifolds: A Structured Recipe for Local Learning</title>

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead. Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks. To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization. Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP. Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

Our method compares favorably to the accuracy of state-of-the-art correspondence algorithms on non-rigid shape matching benchmarks, and is especially advantageous in settings when only scarce data is available.

Abstract: Background: Development of artificial intelligence (AI) models for lung cancer screening requires large, well-annotated low-dose computed tomography (CT) datasets and rigorous performance benchmarks. Purpose: To create a reproducible benchmarking resource leveraging the Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) and multiple public datasets to develop and evaluate models for nodule detection and classification. Materials & Methods: This retrospective study uses the DLCS dataset (1,613 patients; 2,487 nodules) and external datasets including LUNA16, LUNA25, and NLST-3D. For detection, MONAI RetinaNet models were trained on DLCS (DLCS-De) and LUNA16 (LUNA16-De) and evaluated using the Competition Performance Metric (CPM). For nodule-level classification, we compare five strategies: pretrained models (Models Genesis, Med3D), a self-supervised foundation model (FMCB), and ResNet50 with random initialization versus Strategic Warm-Start (ResNet50-SWS) pretrained with detection-derived candidate patches stratified by confidence. Results: For detection on the DLCS test set, DLCS-De achieved sensitivity 0.82 at 2 false positives/scan (CPM 0.63) versus LUNA16-De (0.62, CPM 0.45). For external validation on NLST-3D, DLCS-De (sensitivity 0.72, CPM 0.58) also outperformed LUNA16-De (sensitivity 0.64, CPM 0.49). For classification across multiple datasets, ResNet50-SWS attained AUCs of 0.71 (DLCS; 95% CI, 0.61-0.81), 0.90 (LUNA16; 0.87-0.93), 0.81 (NLST-3D; 0.79-0.82), and 0.80 (LUNA25; 0.78-0.82), matching or exceeding pretrained/self-supervised baselines. Performance differences reflected dataset label standards. Conclusion: This work establishes a standardized benchmarking resource for lung cancer AI research, supporting model development, validation, and translation. All code, models, and data are publicly released to promote reproducibility.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the migration direction of cells based on a single image. A solution to this problem lays the foundation for a variety of applications that were previously not possible. To our knowledge, there is only one related work that employs a classification CNN with four classes (quadrants). However, this approach does not allow for detailed directional resolution. We tackle the single image estimation problem using deep circular regression, with a particular focus on cycle-sensitive methods. On two common datasets, we achieve a mean estimation error of $\sim\!17^\circ$, representing a significant improvement over previous work, which reported estimation error of $30^\circ$ and $34^\circ$, respectively.

Abstract: Underwater object detection has higher requirements of running speed and deployment efficiency for the detector due to its specific environmental challenges. NMS of two- or one-stage object detectors and transformer architecture of query-based end-to-end object detectors are not conducive to deployment on underwater embedded devices with limited processing power. As for the detrimental effect of underwater color cast noise, recent underwater object detectors make network architecture or training complex, which also hinders their application and deployment on unmanned underwater vehicles. In this paper, we propose the Underwater DECO with improved deNoising training (U-DECN), the query-based end-to-end object detector (with ConvNet encoder-decoder architecture) for underwater color cast noise that addresses the above problems. We integrate advanced technologies from DETR variants into DECO and design optimization methods specifically for the ConvNet architecture, including Deformable Convolution in SIM and Separate Contrastive DeNoising Forward methods. To address the underwater color cast noise issue, we propose an Underwater Color DeNoising Query method to improve the generalization of the model for the biased object feature information by different color cast noise. Our U-DECN, with ResNet-50 backbone, achieves the best 64.0 AP on DUO and the best 58.1 AP on RUOD, and 21 FPS (5 times faster than Deformable DETR and DINO 4 FPS) on NVIDIA AGX Orin by TensorRT FP16, outperforming the other state-of-the-art query-based end-to-end object detectors.

Abstract: In clinical medicine, precise image segmentation can provide substantial support to clinicians. However, obtaining high-quality segmentation typically demands extensive pixel-level annotations, which are labor-intensive and expensive. Scribble annotations offer a more cost-effective alternative by improving labeling efficiency. Nonetheless, using such sparse supervision for training reliable medical image segmentation models remains a significant challenge. Some studies employ pseudo-labeling to enhance supervision, but these methods are susceptible to noise interference. To address these challenges, we introduce ScribbleVS, a framework designed to learn from scribble annotations. We introduce a Regional Pseudo Labels Diffusion Module to expand the scope of supervision and reduce the impact of noise present in pseudo labels. Additionally, we introduce a Dynamic Competitive Selection module for enhanced refinement in selecting pseudo labels. Experiments conducted on the ACDC, MSCMRseg, WORD, and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate promising results, achieving segmentation precision comparable to fully supervised models. The codes of this study are available at https://github.com/ortonwang/ScribbleVS.

Abstract: Physical reasoning remains a significant challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This limitation arises from an inability to translate learned knowledge into predictions about physical behavior. Although continual fine-tuning can mitigate this issue, it is expensive for large models and impractical to perform repeatedly for every task. This necessitates the creation of modular and scalable ways to teach VLMs about physical reasoning. To that end, we introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), a modular framework where specialized smaller VLMs are fine-tuned to generate detailed physical scene descriptions. These can be used as physical contexts to enhance the reasoning capabilities of larger VLMs. PCBs enable the separation of visual perception from reasoning, allowing us to analyze their relative contributions to physical understanding. We perform experiments on CLEVRER and on Falling Tower, a stability detection dataset with both simulated and real-world scenes, to demonstrate that PCBs provide substantial performance improvements, increasing average accuracy by up to 13.8% on complex physical reasoning tasks. Notably, PCBs also show strong Sim2Real transfer, successfully generalizing from simulated training data to real-world scenes.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving systems is of paramount importance, yet existing research has largely focused on conventional benchmarks rather than safety-critical evaluation. In this work, we present SCD-Bench (Safety Cognition Driving Benchmark) a novel framework specifically designed to assess the safety cognition capabilities of VLMs within interactive driving scenarios. To address the scalability challenge of data annotation, we introduce ADA (Autonomous Driving Annotation), a semi-automated labeling system, further refined through expert review by professionals with domain-specific knowledge in autonomous driving. To facilitate scalable and consistent evaluation, we also propose an automated assessment pipeline leveraging large language models, which demonstrates over 98% agreement with human expert judgments. In addressing the broader challenge of aligning VLMs with safety cognition in driving environments, we construct SCD-Training, the first large-scale dataset tailored for this task, comprising 324.35K high-quality samples. Through extensive experiments, we show that models trained on SCD-Training exhibit marked improvements not only on SCD-Bench, but also on general and domain-specific benchmarks, offering a new perspective on enhancing safety-aware interactions in vision-language systems for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Low-cost millimeter automotive radar has received more and more attention due to its ability to handle adverse weather and lighting conditions in autonomous driving. However, the lack of quality datasets hinders research and development. We report a new method that is able to simulate 4D millimeter wave radar signals including pitch, yaw, range, and Doppler velocity along with radar signal strength (RSS) using camera image, light detection and ranging (lidar) point cloud, and ego-velocity. The method is based on two new neural networks: 1) DIS-Net, which estimates the spatial distribution and number of radar signals, and 2) RSS-Net, which predicts the RSS of the signal based on appearance and geometric information. We have implemented and tested our method using open datasets from 3 different models of commercial automotive radar. The experimental results show that our method can successfully generate high-fidelity radar signals. Moreover, we have trained a popular object detection neural network with data augmented by our synthesized radar. The network outperforms the counterpart trained only on raw radar data, a promising result to facilitate future radar-based research and development.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet their performance in open aerial environments remains underexplored. In this work, we present Open3D-VQA, a novel benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to reason about complex spatial relationships from an aerial perspective. The benchmark comprises 73k QA pairs spanning 7 general spatial reasoning tasks, including multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer formats, and supports both visual and point cloud modalities. The questions are automatically generated from spatial relations extracted from both real-world and simulated aerial scenes. Evaluation on 13 popular MLLMs reveals that: 1) Models are generally better at answering questions about relative spatial relations than absolute distances, 2) 3D LLMs fail to demonstrate significant advantages over 2D LLMs, and 3) Fine-tuning solely on the simulated dataset can significantly improve the model's spatial reasoning performance in real-world scenarios. We release our benchmark, data generation pipeline, and evaluation toolkit to support further research: https://github.com/EmbodiedCity/Open3D-VQA.code.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of LiDAR-based place recognition, which traditionally depends on costly and time-consuming prior 3D maps. To overcome this, we first construct LiRSI-XA dataset, which encompasses approximately $110,000$ remote sensing submaps and $13,000$ LiDAR point cloud submaps captured in urban scenes, and propose a novel method, L2RSI, for cross-view LiDAR place recognition using high-resolution Remote Sensing Imagery. This approach enables large-scale localization capabilities at a reduced cost by leveraging readily available overhead images as map proxies. L2RSI addresses the dual challenges of cross-view and cross-modal place recognition by learning feature alignment between point cloud submaps and remote sensing submaps in the semantic domain. Additionally, we introduce a novel probability propagation method based on particle estimation to refine position predictions, effectively leveraging temporal and spatial information. This approach enables large-scale retrieval and cross-scene generalization without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on LiRSI-XA demonstrate that, within a $100km^2$ retrieval range, L2RSI accurately localizes $83.27\%$ of point cloud submaps within a $30m$ radius for top-$1$ retrieved location.

Abstract: Vision Language Foundation Models based on CLIP architecture for remote sensing primarily rely on short text captions, which often result in incomplete semantic representations. Although longer captions convey richer information, existing models struggle to process them effectively because of limited text-encoding capacity, and there remains a shortage of resources that align remote sensing images with both short text and long text captions. To address this gap, we introduce DGTRSD, a dual-granularity remote sensing image-text dataset, where each image is paired with both a short text caption and a long text description, providing a solid foundation for dual-granularity semantic modeling. Based on this, we further propose DGTRS-CLIP, a dual-granularity curriculum learning framework that combines short text and long text supervision to achieve dual-granularity semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on four typical zero-shot tasks: long text cross-modal retrieval, short text cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and semantic localization demonstrate that DGTRS-CLIP consistently outperforms existing methods across all tasks. The code has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/MitsuiChen14/DGTRS.

Abstract: Document Reading Order Recovery is a fundamental task in document image understanding, playing a pivotal role in enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and serving as a critical preprocessing step for large language models (LLMs). Existing methods often struggle with complex layouts(e.g., multi-column newspapers), high-overhead interactions between cross-modal elements (visual regions and textual semantics), and a lack of robust evaluation benchmarks. We introduce XY-Cut++, an advanced layout ordering method that integrates pre-mask processing, multi-granularity segmentation, and cross-modal matching to address these challenges. Our method significantly enhances layout ordering accuracy compared to traditional XY-Cut techniques. Specifically, XY-Cut++ achieves state-of-the-art performance (98.8 BLEU overall) while maintaining simplicity and efficiency. It outperforms existing baselines by up to 24\% and demonstrates consistent accuracy across simple and complex layouts on the newly introduced DocBench-100 dataset. This advancement establishes a reliable foundation for document structure recovery, setting a new standard for layout ordering tasks and facilitating more effective RAG and LLM preprocessing.

Abstract: All-in-One image restoration aims to address multiple image degradation problems using a single model, offering a more practical and versatile solution compared to designing dedicated models for each degradation type. Existing approaches typically rely on Degradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide image restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation information and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome these limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration framework that introduces a fine-grained degradation extractor and a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM). The DP-SSM leverages the fine-grained degradation features captured by the extractor as dynamic prompts, which are then incorporated into the state space modeling process. This enhances the model's adaptability to diverse degradation types, while a complementary High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB) recovers local high-frequency details. Extensive experiments on a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR achieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM, respectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of DPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a method for video face reenactment that integrates a 3D face parametric model into a latent diffusion framework, aiming to improve shape consistency and motion control in existing video-based face generation approaches. Our approach employs the FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions) model as the 3D face parametric representation, providing a unified framework for modeling face expressions and head pose. This not only enables precise extraction of motion features from driving videos, but also contributes to the faithful preservation of face shape and geometry. Specifically, we enhance the latent diffusion model with rich 3D expression and detailed pose information by incorporating depth maps, normal maps, and rendering maps derived from FLAME sequences. These maps serve as motion guidance and are encoded into the denoising UNet through a specifically designed Geometric Guidance Encoder (GGE). A multi-layer feature fusion module with integrated self-attention mechanisms is used to combine facial appearance and motion latent features within the spatial domain. By utilizing the 3D face parametric model as motion guidance, our method enables parametric alignment of face identity between the reference image and the motion captured from the driving video. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method excels at generating high-quality face animations with precise expression and head pose variation modeling. In addition, it demonstrates strong generalization performance on out-of-domain images. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/weimengting/MagicPortrait.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Reward Models (RMs) have shown significant promise in delivering reward signals to align vision models with human preferences. However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct responses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often leading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long chains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly strengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be improved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward model, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both visual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize the model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount of image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o, which is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure of CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge and generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal preference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision tasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection sampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally used for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize for correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision reward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are increasingly used for end-to-end driving due to their world knowledge and reasoning ability. Most prior work, however, inserts textual chains-of-thought (CoT) as intermediate steps tailored to the current scene. Such symbolic compressions can blur spatio-temporal relations and discard fine visual cues, creating a cross-modal gap between perception and planning. We propose FSDrive, a visual spatio-temporal CoT framework that enables VLAs to think in images. The model first acts as a world model to generate a unified future frame that overlays coarse but physically-plausible priors-future lane dividers and 3D boxes-on the predicted future image. This unified frame serves as the visual CoT, capturing both spatial structure and temporal evolution. The same VLA then functions as an inverse-dynamics model, planning trajectories from current observations and the visual CoT. To equip VLAs with image generation while preserving understanding, we introduce a unified pre-training paradigm that expands the vocabulary to include visual tokens and jointly optimizes VQA (for semantics) and future-frame prediction (for dynamics). A progressive easy-to-hard scheme first predicts lane/box priors to enforce physical constraints, then completes full future frames for fine details. On nuScenes and NAVSIM, FSDrive improves trajectory accuracy and reduces collisions under both ST-P3 and UniAD metrics, and attains competitive FID for future-frame generation despite using lightweight autoregression. It also advances scene understanding on DriveLM. Together, these results indicate that visual CoT narrows the cross-modal gap and yields safer, more anticipatory planning. Code is available at https://github.com/MIV-XJTU/FSDrive.

Abstract: Understanding infographic charts with design-driven visual elements (e.g., pictograms, icons) requires both visual recognition and reasoning, posing challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing visual-question answering benchmarks fall short in evaluating these capabilities of MLLMs due to the lack of paired plain charts and visual-element-based questions. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes 5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying data but differing in visual presentations. We further design visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new opportunities for advancing MLLMs in infographic chart understanding. We release InfoChartQA at https://github.com/CoolDawnAnt/InfoChartQA.

Abstract: Virtual try-on technology has become increasingly important in the fashion and retail industries, enabling the generation of high-fidelity garment images that adapt seamlessly to target human models. While existing methods have achieved notable progress, they still face significant challenges in maintaining consistency across different poses. Specifically, geometric distortions lead to a lack of spatial consistency, mismatches in garment structure and texture across poses result in semantic inconsistency, and the loss or distortion of fine-grained details diminishes visual fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose HF-VTON, a novel framework that ensures high-fidelity virtual try-on performance across diverse poses. HF-VTON consists of three key modules: (1) the Appearance-Preserving Warp Alignment Module (APWAM), which aligns garments to human poses, addressing geometric deformations and ensuring spatial consistency; (2) the Semantic Representation and Comprehension Module (SRCM), which captures fine-grained garment attributes and multi-pose data to enhance semantic representation, maintaining structural, textural, and pattern consistency; and (3) the Multimodal Prior-Guided Appearance Generation Module (MPAGM), which integrates multimodal features and prior knowledge from pre-trained models to optimize appearance generation, ensuring both semantic and geometric consistency. Additionally, to overcome data limitations in existing benchmarks, we introduce the SAMP-VTONS dataset, featuring multi-pose pairs and rich textual annotations for a more comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that HF-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both VITON-HD and SAMP-VTONS, excelling in visual fidelity, semantic consistency, and detail preservation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the de-facto model for generating high-quality visual content like videos and images. A huge bottleneck is the attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However, existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. To address this concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. Experimental results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1% of the tokens during inference, outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and MInference.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on object recognition achieve high task performance but continue to exhibit vulnerability under a range of visual perturbations and out-of-domain images, when compared with biological vision. Prior work has demonstrated that coupling a standard CNN with a front-end (VOneBlock) that mimics the primate primary visual cortex (V1) can improve overall model robustness. Expanding on this, we introduce Early Vision Networks (EVNets), a new class of hybrid CNNs that combine the VOneBlock with a novel SubcorticalBlock, whose architecture draws from computational models in neuroscience and is parameterized to maximize alignment with subcortical responses reported across multiple experimental studies. Without being optimized to do so, the assembly of the SubcorticalBlock with the VOneBlock improved V1 alignment across most standard V1 benchmarks, and better modeled extra-classical receptive field phenomena. In addition, EVNets exhibit stronger emergent shape bias and outperform the base CNN architecture by 9.3% on an aggregate benchmark of robustness evaluations, including adversarial perturbations, common corruptions, and domain shifts. Finally, we show that EVNets can be further improved when paired with a state-of-the-art data augmentation technique, surpassing the performance of the isolated data augmentation approach by 6.2% on our robustness benchmark. This result reveals complementary benefits between changes in architecture to better mimic biology and training-based machine learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown impressive success using a PPO-style reinforcement algorithm with group-normalized rewards. However, the effectiveness of GRPO in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) has still been less studyed. In this paper, we explore GRPO and identify two problems that deteriorate the effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) vanishing advantage. To mitigate these challenges, we propose DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with Reg-GRPO (Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation. Reg-GRPO reformulates the GRPO loss function into a regression task that directly predicts the advantage in GRPO, eliminating the need for safeguards such as the clipping and min functions. It directly aligns the model with advantages, providing guidance to prefer better ones. The difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy augments input prompts/videos to locate the difficulty of samples at solvable difficulty levels, enabling diverse reward signals. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly improves video reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos remains a fundamental challenge in 3D vision. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision, and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppress redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation, eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA) focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations: the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations. We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps: first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA datasets and three types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

Abstract: While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA). Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network (DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation. Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models, which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data, The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations, we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes from dashcam videos has attracted increasing attention due to its significance in autonomous driving and scene understanding. While recent advances have made impressive progress, most methods still unify all background elements into a single representation, hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the 3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are available at our project page.

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges. Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by 0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behaviour classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviours such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioural analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) aims to translate natural language from sign language videos, serving as a vital bridge for inclusive communication. While recent advances leverage powerful visual backbones and large language models, most approaches mainly focus on manual signals (hand gestures) and tend to overlook non-manual cues like mouthing. In fact, mouthing conveys essential linguistic information in sign languages and plays a crucial role in disambiguating visually similar signs. In this paper, we propose SignClip, a novel framework to improve the accuracy of sign language translation. It fuses manual and non-manual cues, specifically spatial gesture and lip movement features. Besides, SignClip introduces a hierarchical contrastive learning framework with multi-level alignment objectives, ensuring semantic consistency across sign-lip and visual-text modalities. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. For example, on PHOENIX14T, in the Gloss-free setting, SignClip surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model SpaMo, improving BLEU-4 from 24.32 to 24.71, and ROUGE from 46.57 to 48.38.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly narrows the gap to full supervision.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained classifier on any given image. Given an input image $x$ and a frozen model $f$, we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask $m$ such that the explanation $e = m \odot x$ preserves both the model's prediction and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i) multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation; (ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp 0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small, human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown near-expert performance in segmenting complex medical tissues and tumors. However, existing models are often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging, particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs, Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships, long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details. Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes, which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds. To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision, where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency. However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile, we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively. Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of the model.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to train a model on a sequence of tasks (i.e., a CL scenario) while balancing the trade-off between plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (retaining prior knowledge). The dominantly adopted conventional evaluation protocol for CL algorithms selects the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, mini-batch size, regularization strengths, etc.) within a given scenario and then evaluates the algorithms using these hyperparameters in the same scenario. However, this protocol has significant shortcomings: it overestimates the CL capacity of algorithms and relies on unrealistic hyperparameter tuning, which is not feasible for real-world applications. From the fundamental principles of evaluation in machine learning, we argue that the evaluation of CL algorithms should focus on assessing the generalizability of their CL capacity to unseen scenarios. Based on this, we propose the Generalizable Two-phase Evaluation Protocol (GTEP) consisting of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation phases. Both phases share the same scenario configuration (e.g., number of tasks) but are generated from different datasets. Hyperparameters of CL algorithms are tuned in the first phase and applied in the second phase to evaluate the algorithms. We apply this protocol to class-incremental learning, both with and without pretrained models. Across more than 8,000 experiments, our results show that most state-of-the-art algorithms fail to replicate their reported performance, highlighting that their CL capacity has been significantly overestimated in the conventional evaluation protocol. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/GTEP.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective post-training strategy for enhancing reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that encourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering, leading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the human-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but think carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when reasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training strategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective 'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with empty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold start for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to freely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome rewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by up to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even improving it. Further evaluations across LLM (GSM8K), VLM (CLEVR, Super-CLEVR, GeoQA), and Agentic (AITZ) tasks-covering a range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently reveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning steps as training advances. These findings shed light on the path toward human-like reasoning patterns in RL approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/kokolerk/TON.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the angle testing problem in the context of similarity search in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces and propose two projection-based probabilistic kernel functions, one designed for angle comparison and the other for angle thresholding. Unlike existing approaches that rely on random projection vectors drawn from Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages reference angles and employs a deterministic structure for the projection vectors. Notably, our kernel functions do not require asymptotic assumptions, such as the number of projection vectors tending to infinity, and can be both theoretically and experimentally shown to outperform Gaussian-distribution-based kernel functions. We apply the proposed kernel function to Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) and demonstrate that our approach achieves a 2.5X ~ 3X higher query-per-second (QPS) throughput compared to the widely-used graph-based search algorithm HNSW.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled instruction-conditioned robotic systems with improved generalization. However, most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs' strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2 capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation. RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2 interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks, RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to be the second-deadliest cancer by 2030, making early detection critical. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key cancer precursors, present a clinical dilemma, as current guidelines struggle to stratify malignancy risk, leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed diagnoses. Here, we developed Cyst-X, an AI framework for IPMN risk prediction trained on a unique, multi-center dataset of 1,461 MRI scans from 764 patients. Cyst-X achieves significantly higher accuracy (AUC = 0.82) than both the established Kyoto guidelines (AUC = 0.75) and expert radiologists, particularly in correct identification of high-risk lesions. Clinically, this translates to a 20% increase in cancer detection sensitivity (87.8% vs. 64.1%) for high-risk lesions. We demonstrate that this performance is maintained in a federated learning setting, allowing for collaborative model training without compromising patient privacy. To accelerate research in early pancreatic cancer detection, we publicly release the Cyst-X dataset and models, providing the first large-scale, multi-center MRI resource for pancreatic cyst analysis.

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions: (1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving 0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste, making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) including our purposed YOLOv8n-CBAM model using our annotated dataset designed for recycling. We found a clear trade-off between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier, EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy(~ 96%) but suffered from high latency (~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object detection models delivered strong performance (up to 80% mAP) with ultra-fast inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB ), making them ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier ("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify, localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images.

Summary:
CountFormer, a transformer-based framework, enhances object counting by recognizing visual repetition and structural coherence, similar to how humans count diverse objects. Unlike existing models, CountFormer accurately counts objects with complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping components. It replaces the visual encoder of the CounTR architecture with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2, generating rich and spatially consistent feature representations. The model incorporates positional embedding fusion to maintain geometric relationships and decodes features into density maps using a lightweight convolutional decoder. Tested on the FSC-147 dataset, CountFormer achieves comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods and excels in counting structurally intricate or densely packed scenes. Integrating foundation models like DINOv2 enables counting systems to emulate human-like structural perception, progressing towards a general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However, most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2, which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2 enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception, advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image. This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic environments.

<div> dual-conditioning architecture, physics-aware, remote sensing imagery, RareFlow, out-of-distribution robustness
Summary:<br />
RareFlow is a physics-aware super-resolution framework designed for remote sensing imagery that excels in out-of-distribution conditions. It utilizes a dual-conditioning architecture, including a Gated ControlNet for geometric fidelity and textual prompts for semantic guidance. The framework enforces spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor properties through a multifaceted loss function and quantifies predictive uncertainty to identify unfamiliar inputs. In blind evaluations on a curated benchmark of multi-sensor satellite imagery, RareFlow's outputs were rated highly by experts, approaching ground truth fidelity and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, such as a 40% reduction in FID, further validate RareFlow's superiority. This framework offers a robust solution for high-fidelity synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and introduces a new paradigm for controlled generation in the face of severe domain shift. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.23816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly 40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for controlled generation under severe domain shift.

Summary: 
This work introduces a novel approach to training-free 3D scene synthesis using text descriptions. By repurposing text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile generators, the method enables scalable generation of large, coherent scenes with local semantic control. The approach reframes scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem, where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and blended seamlessly. This eliminates the need for scene-level datasets or retraining, relying on minimal heuristics and leveraging object-level priors for generalization. The method supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for language-driven 3D scene construction. <div>
arXiv:2510.23880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However, existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem, where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

<div> semantic segmentation, CLIP models, visual discriminability, LHT-CLIP, state-of-the-art performance

Summary:
LHT-CLIP extends CLIP models to semantic segmentation by addressing the misalignment between image-level pre-training objectives and pixel-level visual understanding. The framework systematically leverages visual discriminability across layer, head, and token levels without requiring additional training. Analysis reveals that final layers prioritize image-text alignment over visual discriminability, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. Selective techniques such as semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement are proposed to restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation performance. LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8 common semantic segmentation benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness and practicality for real-world deployment. <div>
arXiv:2510.23894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14), partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world deployment.

Summary:
DynaStride is a pipeline designed to generate coherent, scene-level captions for instructional videos without the need for manual scene segmentation. It utilizes adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key transitions within each scene. The process involves a multimodal chain-of-thought approach to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are subsequently refined and fused using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm. The resulting scene-level caption integrates visual semantics and temporal reasoning to provide a comprehensive instructional guide. Evaluation against strong baselines shows consistent improvements in N-gram-based metrics and semantic similarity measures. Qualitative analysis indicates that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally coherent and informative, showcasing potential for enhancing AI-powered instructional content generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: DynaStride is a pipeline for generating coherent, scene-level captions in instructional videos. It employs adaptive frame sampling, multimodal windowing, and a chain-of-thought process to produce comprehensive instructional captions. Evaluation against baselines demonstrates consistent improvements in metrics and semantic similarity measures. Qualitative analysis supports the effectiveness of DynaStride in producing temporally coherent and informative captions, showcasing promise for enhancing AI-powered instructional content generation. <div>
arXiv:2510.23907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption. Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o, demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving AI-powered instructional content generation.

<div> Keywords: TurboPortrait3D, novel-view synthesis, image diffusion models, low-latency, multi-view consistent

Summary: 
TurboPortrait3D is a novel method for low-latency novel-view synthesis of human portraits. It combines image-to-3D models with image diffusion models to enhance the quality of portrait generation while maintaining 3D-awareness. The approach takes a single frontal image of a subject as input and uses a feedforward image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation. A single-step diffusion model then refines noisy renders in a multi-view consistent manner. A unique training strategy involves pre-training on synthetic multi-view data and fine-tuning on real images. The method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques for portrait novel-view synthesis, producing high-quality results efficiently. TurboPortrait3D is capable of generating detailed, identity-preserving portraits with minimal computational cost, making it a promising advancement in the field. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.23929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view synthesis, while being efficient in time.

Summary: <br />
Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an efficient representation for indoor scene reconstruction, but struggles with large low-texture areas. PlanarGS is a new framework tailored for indoor scenes that utilizes Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) for segmentation and refinement. It incorporates planar and geometric priors to improve surface detail and accuracy. PlanarGS outperforms current methods significantly in reconstructing 3D surfaces. The framework includes a pretrained vision-language segmentation model, cross-view fusion, and inspection with geometric cues. The optimization process includes planar and geometric supervision terms. Extensive experiments on indoor benchmarks demonstrate PlanarGS's ability to reconstruct detailed and accurate 3D surfaces. The project page provides further information on the framework. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.23930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

Summary: 
AIRe (Adaptive Implicit Neural Representation) introduces an adaptive training scheme for improving implicit neural representations (INRs). By using a neuron pruning mechanism to eliminate redundancy and input frequency densification to enhance representation capacity, AIRe achieves a better balance between network size and reconstruction quality. The pruning stage identifies and removes less-contributory neurons, transferring their information to remaining neurons before structured pruning. The densification stage adds input frequencies where the signal underfits, expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), AIRe demonstrates a reduction in model size while maintaining or enhancing reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be made available for public use.

arXiv:2510.23943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations (INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural $\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits, expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs, we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving, reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public use.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces the concept of Neural Universal Scene Descriptor (Neural USD) to address challenges in precise and iterative object editing in generative modeling. Inspired by the Universal Scene Descriptor (USD) standard in computer graphics, Neural USD represents scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical manner. This framework enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and pose, minimizing model-specific constraints and accommodating diverse signals. By applying a fine-tuning approach, the control signals are disentangled from each other, allowing for iterative and incremental workflows. The authors evaluate different design considerations for Neural USD and demonstrate how it facilitates precise object editing without unintended global changes in the scene.

arXiv:2510.23956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling, especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods, trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables iterative and incremental workflows. More information at: https://escontrela.me/neural_usd .

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever. Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats, requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks, which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm, a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party (VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a framework for transparent reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation using vision-language models. The model is designed to align with expert radiologists' reasoning processes, providing stepwise explanations for predictions. It combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to learn from radiologists' thought processes and output reasoning that mirrors clinical decision-making. In evaluations, the approach achieves competitive accuracy in multi-label classification while enhancing interpretability. A reader study with radiologists demonstrated that the explicit reasoning traces increased confidence, facilitated error auditing, and reduced reporting time. The release of code and the model NV-Reason-CXR-3B aims to advance the development of trustworthy, explainable AI in medical imaging tasks, emphasizing the importance of transparent reasoning alongside accurate predictions. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent, stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality is as critical as prediction quality.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new method for achieving Cost-and-Quality (CQ) controllability in super-resolution tasks of arbitrary scale. The existing approach of predicting Fourier components individually using a recurrent neural network often leads to reduced performance and inefficiency. The proposed solution suggests predicting multiple components simultaneously to enhance both the quality and efficiency of the super-resolution process.

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming, omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle \& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12 diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of practical AI assistants.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices, demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on unseen external datasets.

Abstract: The automated analysis of the aortic vessel tree (AVT) from computed tomography angiography (CTA) holds immense clinical potential, but its development has been impeded by a lack of shared, high-quality data. We launched the SEG.A. challenge to catalyze progress in this field by introducing a large, publicly available, multi-institutional dataset for AVT segmentation. The challenge benchmarked automated algorithms on a hidden test set, with subsequent optional tasks in surface meshing for computational simulations. Our findings reveal a clear convergence on deep learning methodologies, with 3D U-Net architectures dominating the top submissions. A key result was that an ensemble of the highest-ranking algorithms significantly outperformed individual models, highlighting the benefits of model fusion. Performance was strongly linked to algorithmic design, particularly the use of customized post-processing steps, and the characteristics of the training data. This initiative not only establishes a new performance benchmark but also provides a lasting resource to drive future innovation toward robust, clinically translatable tools.

Summary:
Mars-Bench, a new benchmark, addresses the lack of standardized benchmarks in Mars science. It offers 20 datasets for evaluation of models across a range of Mars-related tasks using orbital and surface imagery. The datasets focus on geologic features like craters, cones, boulders, and frost, allowing for classification, segmentation, and object detection. Pre-trained models on natural images, Earth satellite data, and vision-language models have been evaluated as baselines. Results indicate potential advantages of Mars-specific foundation models over general-domain models, suggesting the need for further investigation into domain-adapted pre-training. Mars-Bench aims to provide a standardized platform for developing and comparing machine learning models in Mars science. Data, models, and code are accessible at https://mars-bench.github.io/. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders, and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data, and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training. Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and comparing machine learning models for Mars science.

Summary:
AutoPrompT is a black-box framework proposed in this paper to address vulnerabilities in text-to-image (T2I) models caused by adversarial prompts. The framework leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for benign prompts. By utilizing an alternating optimization-finetuning pipeline and a dual-evasion strategy, AutoPrompT is able to generate human-readable prompts that bypass filters and expose vulnerabilities in T2I models. The framework incorporates an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring to ensure the generated prompts are human-readable and introduces banned-token penalties to avoid generating banned tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoPrompT in generating filter-resistant adversarial prompts with superior zero-shot transferability, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in commercial APIs like Leonardo.Ai.

Summary:<br /><br />AutoPrompT is a black-box framework that leverages large language models to automatically generate human-readable adversarial prompts for text-to-image models. This approach enhances red-teaming effectiveness by bypassing filters and exposing vulnerabilities, with experiments showcasing its superior zero-shot transferability and critical vulnerability identification in commercial APIs. <div>
arXiv:2510.24034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs (e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

Summary:
SNELLA is a one-stage method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained vision models. It addresses limitations of current methods by selectively updating weight matrices using a low-rank decomposition merged with nonlinear kernel functions to prevent interdependency. SNELLA also introduces an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism to encourage weight competition across and within layers based on importance scores. Experimental results demonstrate that SNELLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with low memory usage, outperforming SPT-LoRA in Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark by 1.8%. It also shows a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9% across models with parameter scales ranging from 86M to 632M. The source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/ssfgunner/SNELL. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.24037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates, enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s. 90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA. Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9% across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.24038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features, which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other. This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations, leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14 zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA, especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-image, synthetic data generation, fine-grained classification, attribute conditioning, overfitting mitigation

Summary:
Text-to-image (T2I) models are used for generating synthetic training data for classification tasks, but faces challenges in quality and diversity. A new fine-tuning strategy called BOB (BeyondOBjects) is proposed to address these issues. BOB extracts class-agnostic attributes from real examples, conditions the T2I model on these attributes during fine-tuning, and then marginalizes them during generation. This approach helps mitigate overfitting, preserve the model's generative prior, reduce estimation errors, and minimize unintended inter-class associations. Experimental results across multiple models, backbones, and datasets show that BOB achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained classification when augmented with synthetic data. Notably, BOB outperforms previous methods like DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset with only five real images and 100 synthetic images. Fine-tuning downstream models with BOB outperforms using 10 real images in three out of four benchmarks, showing significant accuracy improvements in 14 experimental settings. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images). In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10 real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

Summary:
OmniText addresses limitations of text inpainting methods by enabling text removal, style control, and reducing duplicated letters. The proposed method utilizes self-attention inversion for text removal and redistributes cross-attention to reduce text hallucinations. A latent optimization framework with novel loss functions is introduced for controllable inpainting, including cross-attention content loss and self-attention style loss. The OmniText framework is evaluated on diverse Text Image Manipulation (TIM) tasks using the OmniText-Bench benchmark dataset, showcasing its versatility and performance compared to other methods. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks and metrics, establishing OmniText as a generalist method capable of diverse TIM tasks while maintaining comparable performance to specialist methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.24093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation (TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content. Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images, target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and is comparable with specialist methods.

<div> interpretability, pre-trained models, visual representations, classifiability, semantics <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article explores the relationship between interpretability and classifiability in pre-trained visual models. It introduces the concept of the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) to quantify the interpretability of representations based on the ratio of interpretable semantics. Surprisingly, the study finds a positive correlation between interpretability and classifiability, indicating that representations with higher classifiability also offer more interpretable semantics. This discovery suggests that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a focus on interpretability can lead to improved classifiability. Additionally, utilizing interpretations of representations can result in accurate predictions with minimal loss in accuracy. Overall, the research highlights the potential for enhancing both interpretability and classifiability in pre-trained vision models, allowing practitioners to leverage the benefits of improved interpretability for downstream tasks. The code for this research is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations, only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e., representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models.

<div> knowledge distillation, model compression, visual applications, heterogeneous architectures, frequency domain<br />
<br />
Summary:
Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD) is introduced as a framework for improving model compression in visual applications. The approach leverages intermediate features in the frequency domain to enable effective transfer of knowledge between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. By applying Fourier transform to capture global feature information, UHKD addresses representational discrepancies and enhances cross-architecture transfer. The framework includes a Feature Transformation Module (FTM) for generating compact frequency-domain representations of teacher features and a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) for projecting and aligning student features through multi-level matching. Training is guided by a joint objective that combines mean squared error on intermediate features with Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, showcasing UHKD as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student, reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment. However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers. To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD) is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied to capture global feature information, alleviating representational discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC) as a framework to accelerate diffusion models by reusing model outputs. ETC addresses the issues of trajectory deviations and inconsistencies in generated results by leveraging smooth continuity of diffusion trajectories and introducing a trend predictor for stable future directions. It also proposes a model-specific error tolerance search mechanism to maintain quality refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX while maintaining consistency with a negligible degradation of the SSIM score. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance, leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel training-free framework aimed at improving the compositionality of modern text-to-image models. These models often struggle with accurately depicting object counts, attributes, and spatial relations. The proposed framework combines an object-centric approach with self-refinement to enhance layout faithfulness while maintaining aesthetic quality. It leverages large language models to generate explicit layouts from input prompts and integrates them into the image generation process. An object-centric vision-language model then iteratively selects the most prompt-aligned outcome through a judging process. By incorporating explicit layout-grounding and self-refinement during inference-time scaling, the framework demonstrates improved scene alignment with prompts compared to existing text-to-image models. The code for implementing the framework is available on GitHub. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts, attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with prompts compared to recent text-to-image models.

arXiv:2510.24136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2 effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and 0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were 0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM visualizations were incorporated to enhance model interpretability by highlighting tissue areas that are medically relevant. These findings validate that MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing architectural model for classifying CRC tissues.

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing, Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature, top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on safety-critical autonomous driving tasks.

Summary:
The article discusses the vulnerability of the image segmentation model SAM to adversarial attacks and the introduction of its successor, SAM2. SAM2 has shown strong generalization capabilities in video segmentation, but its robustness to attacks is unknown. The study explores the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and SAM2, highlighting the challenges posed by their architectural differences. To address these challenges, the paper introduces UAP-SAM2, the first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual semantic deviation. The attack strategy includes a target-scanning approach for cross-prompt transferability and a dual semantic deviation framework for optimizing the adversarial attack. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UAP-SAM2, outperforming current state-of-the-art attacks significantly. <div>

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases. Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty, which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated. Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC. Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical structures. The proposed CLFSeg improves performance while ensuring computing efficiency, which makes it a potential solution for real-world medical diagnostic scenarios.

<div> Keywords: autoregressive modeling, visual generation, MC-SJD, Speculative Jacobi Decoding, parallel decoding

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called MC-SJD to accelerate autoregressive visual generation. The traditional per-token generation process in autoregressive models is slow, often requiring thousands of steps for a single sample. MC-SJD is a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework that builds upon Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD). SJD had shown potential for speeding up autoregressive generation but was limited by token instability across iterations. MC-SJD addresses this issue by using an information-theoretic approach based on coupling to maximize the probability of sampling identical draft tokens in consecutive iterations. This simple modification results in significant performance gains, with up to a 4.2x acceleration in image generation and a 13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard autoregressive decoding. The output quality remains unchanged despite the acceleration achieved. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.24211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD, a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations, all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Summary:
ID^2Face is a new face anonymization framework that focuses on training to disentangle identity and non-identity attributes in a structured latent space. It eliminates the need for post-training interventions by directly anonymizing faces during inference. The model includes an Identity-Decoupled Latent Recomposer, an Identity-Guided Latent Harmonizer, and an Orthogonal Identity Mapping strategy to enforce disentanglement and suppress identity leakage. By training the model with a recomposition-based reconstruction loss, ID^2Face outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality, identity suppression, and data utility preservation. The approach enhances anonymization by sampling random identity vectors from the learned space and enforcing orthogonality between sampled and source identity vectors during inference. <div>
arXiv:2510.24213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space. To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and utility preservation.

<div> Keywords: MLLMs, visual token pruning, saliency, coverage, semantic completeness

Summary:
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face computational challenges due to processing a large number of visual tokens, many of which are redundant. To address this issue, a novel visual token pruning strategy called SCOPE is proposed. SCOPE aims to balance saliency and coverage of selected visual tokens to maintain semantic completeness. The method calculates set-coverage for selected tokens based on relationships and token-coverage gain for unselected tokens. By integrating saliency scores, the SCOPE score is used to iteratively select the token with the highest score. Experimental results on various benchmarks show that SCOPE outperforms existing methods consistently. The code for SCOPE is available on GitHub for further exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- MLLMs process many visual tokens, leading to computational overhead.
- SCOPE method balances saliency and coverage for selected visual tokens.
- It calculates set-coverage and token-coverage gain to maintain semantic completeness.
- The integration of saliency scores improves the selection process.
- Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SCOPE compared to prior approaches. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called \textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/kinredon/SCOPE}{https://github.com/kinredon/SCOPE}.

Summary:<br /> 
This article introduces an event-based microsaccade dataset for studying small eye movement dynamics. The dataset, created using Blender, simulates microsaccades with different angular displacements and durations, capturing the natural temporal dynamics of these movements. The dataset is evaluated using spiking neural networks, with models such as Spiking-VGG11, Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16 achieving high accuracy in classifying microsaccades based on angular displacement. A novel optical-flow-enhanced model, Spiking-VGG16Flow, implemented in SpikingJelly, further enhances the classification accuracy. The results demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available, providing a valuable resource for researchers in the field of cognitive computing. <div>

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees, divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11, Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available at https://waseemshariff126.github.io/microsaccades/ .

<div> robustness, image restoration, object detection, Lipschitz continuity, optimization<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD) to address the functional mismatch between image restoration and object detection networks. It identifies the smooth, continuous transformations of restoration networks and the discontinuous decision boundaries of object detectors as a source of instability in traditional cascade frameworks. LROD harmonizes the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks during training, improving detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall accuracy. The framework, implemented as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO (LR-YOLO), seamlessly extends to existing YOLO detectors. Experimental results on haze and low-light benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of LR-YOLO in enhancing detection performance in adverse conditions. <div>

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO (LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall accuracy.

<div> Keywords: image shadow removal, attention-based architectures, selective state space model, directional modulation mechanism, color restoration<br />
<br />
Summary: 
Recent advancements in image shadow removal have led to the development of deep models that utilize attention-based architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, these models often struggle with distorted structures and inconsistent colors due to fixed attention patterns that mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes DeshadowMamba, a novel approach that combines the selective state space model Mamba with the directional modulation mechanism CrossGate. CrossGate injects shadow-aware similarity into Mamba's input gate, enabling selective integration of relevant context along transition axes. Additionally, ColorShift regularization guides the model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration through contrastive learning objectives. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in image shadow removal tasks. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions, leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential, directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration. Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces UtilGen, a utility-centric data augmentation framework that focuses on generating task-specific high-utility training data for computer vision tasks. UtilGen utilizes a weight allocation network to evaluate the utility of synthetic samples for downstream tasks and iteratively refines the data generation process to maximize utility through model-level and instance-level optimization. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that UtilGen outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87%. The approach shifts the focus from visual characteristics-centric data augmentation to task utility-centric augmentation, producing more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data. <div>

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes -- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to task utility-centric data augmentation.

Summary:<br /><br />Synthetic image attribution is a challenging task, especially in data scarcity conditions where few-shot or zero-shot classification capabilities are needed. A new training-free one-shot attribution method based on image resynthesis is proposed. An image prompt is generated to resynthesize the image with candidate sources for attribution. A new dataset for synthetic image attribution, with face images from text-to-image generators, is introduced. The dataset allows testing of resynthesis methods and comparison to few-shot approaches.

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning. The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot and zero-shot methods.

Summary: 
ViPER is a novel framework designed to enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It introduces a two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a progressive process, enabling iterative evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. ViPER integrates image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy to establish a closed-loop training paradigm. The framework, applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, produces the Qwen-Viper series with significant performance gains across various benchmarks and tasks. Qwen-Viper consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly in fine-grained perception tasks. ViPER's approach highlights the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding in VLMs, paving the way for more autonomous and capable models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.24285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications. Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception, Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization, multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets, including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios. Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Summary:
W2-Net introduces a dual-query mechanism for Referring Expression Counting (REC), decoupling the problem into "what to count" (w2c) and "where to see" (w2s) queries. By guiding the w2s queries to extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, W2-Net enables precise subclass discrimination. Additionally, the Subclass Separable Matching (SSM) strategy enhances inter-subclass separability during label assignment. The proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, achieving a reduction in counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), as well as an improvement in localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code for W2-Net will be made available for further research and experimentation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.24374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Expression Counting (REC) extends class-level object counting to the fine-grained subclass-level, aiming to enumerate objects matching a textual expression that specifies both the class and distinguishing attribute. A fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into "what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically, alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively.

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16} quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically usable tools.

Summary:
The article introduces a new method for polarization image fusion using a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN). This network incorporates luminance information to improve the fusion of polarized images in complex lighting environments. The MLSN includes a multi-scale spatial weight matrix, global-local feature fusion mechanism, and brightness-enhancement module to enhance the quality of the fusion results. Additionally, the article presents the MSP dataset, containing 1000 pairs of polarized images covering various lighting scenarios, to address the scarcity of high-quality datasets in this field.

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN). In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features, realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%, respectively.

However, relying on these reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g., 12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers while highlighting gaps in current research.

<div> Keywords: post-stroke MRI, unsupervised detection, REFLECT, structural abnormalities, lesion segmentation<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
This study evaluates the use of REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Post-stroke MRI can reveal not only focal lesions but also secondary structural changes like atrophy and ventricular enlargement, which are crucial imaging biomarkers for recovery and outcome prediction. The study assesses the performance of REFLECT using dual-expert central-slice annotations on ATLAS data and comparing models trained on stroke patients and healthy controls. Results show that the model trained on healthy controls achieved higher lesion segmentation and improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Training on healthy anatomy improved the model's ability to detect structural abnormalities, indicating the importance of incorporating normal variability into the training data for more accurate detection in post-stroke MRI analysis. <div>

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls (IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43). Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability, enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks, thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference implementation with minimal dependencies, featuring three variants, including GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social, facilitating flexible reimplementation. Experimental results have shown that GenTrack provides superior performance on standard benchmarks and real-world scenarios compared to state-of-the-art trackers, with integrated implementations of baselines for fair comparison. Potential directions for future work are also discussed. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub: https://github.com/SDU-VelKoTek/GenTrack

<title>A Hybrid Approach for Visual Multi-Object Tracking</title>

arXiv:2510.24410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections, detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates. The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable. Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub: https://github.com/SDU-VelKoTek/GenTrack2

<title>50 Years of Water Body Monitoring: The Case of Qaraaoun Reservoir, Lebanon</title>

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation, and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate change and environmental patterns.

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable semantic segmentation models.

<title>Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via Self-Generated Priors</title>

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition, which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors (DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of 14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC, and Tecnick datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games, route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual foundation models.

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated, consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%, camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by 83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at https://liris-xr.github.io/kineo/.

<title>Decoupled MeanFlow: Turning Flow Models into Flow Maps for Accelerated Sampling</title>

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps, mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12, respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this, we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone. It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project page: https://latent-sketchpad.github.io/.

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP, the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents' tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1% to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted environments. Our code, environment, and data are publicly available at https://osworld-mcp.github.io.

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge. Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments. Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in terms of quantitative metrics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security, digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which includes forged images generated from four representative methods: text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

Abstract: Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909 fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In addition, such data could also be used to improve the training of both pathologists and AI systems that might support human experts. All experiments were preregistered at https://osf.io/hj9a7, and the complete dataset along with analysis code is available at https://go.osu.edu/pathogaze.

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at https://github.com/little-misfit/GRAG-Image-Editing.

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips, but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques (cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows, distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code to be released on acceptance.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs, and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection, featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions, including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are available at: https://github.com/HandsomeYun/MIC-BEV.

<title>Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709</link>

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.

<title>Routing Matters in MoE: Scaling Diffusion Transformers with Explicit Routing Guidance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24711</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency. In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation. Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free, frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best viewed as videos at https://andrewsonga.github.io/gvs.

<title>Noise is All You Need: Solving Linear Inverse Problems by Noise Combination Sampling with Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process, while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and, particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly improving robustness and stability.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network) for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance, we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models, achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets. To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2 image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation. Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive keyframe selection method for improved 3D scene reconstruction in dynamic environments. The proposed method integrates two complementary modules: an error-based selection module utilizing photometric and structural similarity (SSIM) errors, and a momentum-based update module that dynamically adjusts keyframe selection thresholds according to scene motion dynamics. By dynamically curating the most informative frames, our approach addresses a key data bottleneck in real-time perception. This allows for the creation of high-quality 3D world representations from a compressed data stream, a critical step towards scalable robot learning and deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional static keyframe selection strategies, such as fixed temporal intervals or uniform frame skipping. These findings highlight a meaningful advancement toward adaptive perception systems that can dynamically respond to complex and evolving visual scenes. We evaluate our proposed adaptive keyframe selection module on two recent state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction networks, Spann3r and CUT3R, and observe consistent improvements in reconstruction quality across both frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each individual component in our method, underlining their contribution to the overall performance gains.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk, particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$), especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory, significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

Abstract: Audio-visual captioning aims to generate holistic scene descriptions by jointly modeling sound and vision. While recent methods have improved performance through sophisticated modality fusion, it remains unclear to what extent the two modalities are complementary in current audio-visual captioning models and how robust these models are when one modality is degraded. We address these questions by conducting systematic modality robustness tests on LAVCap, a state-of-the-art audio-visual captioning model, in which we selectively suppress or corrupt the audio or visual streams to quantify sensitivity and complementarity. The analysis reveals a pronounced bias toward the audio stream in LAVCap. To evaluate how balanced audio-visual captioning models are in their use of both modalities, we augment AudioCaps with textual annotations that jointly describe the audio and visual streams, yielding the AudioVisualCaps dataset. In our experiments, we report LAVCap baseline results on AudioVisualCaps. We also evaluate the model under modality robustness tests on AudioVisualCaps and the results indicate that LAVCap trained on AudioVisualCaps exhibits less modality bias than when trained on AudioCaps.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving maps raw sensor inputs directly into ego-vehicle trajectories to avoid cascading errors from perception modules and to leverage rich semantic cues. Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and covariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is typically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and maps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory Scoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs without losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of our knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only learning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data. ZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive Policy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable actions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three benchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop planning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM (simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the state-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on HUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.

Abstract: Learning generalizable robotic manipulation policies remains a key challenge due to the scarcity of diverse real-world training data. While recent approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize 2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate, generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability across diverse manipulation tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration. These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.

Abstract: Purpose: Surgical scene understanding is key to advancing computer-aided and intelligent surgical systems. Current approaches predominantly rely on visual data or end-to-end learning, which limits fine-grained contextual modeling. This work aims to enhance surgical scene representations by integrating 3D acoustic information, enabling temporally and spatially aware multimodal understanding of surgical environments.
  Methods: We propose a novel framework for generating 4D audio-visual representations of surgical scenes by projecting acoustic localization information from a phased microphone array onto dynamic point clouds from an RGB-D camera. A transformer-based acoustic event detection module identifies relevant temporal segments containing tool-tissue interactions which are spatially localized in the audio-visual scene representation. The system was experimentally evaluated in a realistic operating room setup during simulated surgical procedures performed by experts.
  Results: The proposed method successfully localizes surgical acoustic events in 3D space and associates them with visual scene elements. Experimental evaluation demonstrates accurate spatial sound localization and robust fusion of multimodal data, providing a comprehensive, dynamic representation of surgical activity.
  Conclusion: This work introduces the first approach for spatial sound localization in dynamic surgical scenes, marking a significant advancement toward multimodal surgical scene representations. By integrating acoustic and visual data, the proposed framework enables richer contextual understanding and provides a foundation for future intelligent and autonomous surgical systems.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

<title>SPARTA: Evaluating Reasoning Segmentation Robustness through Black-Box Adversarial Paraphrasing in Text Autoencoder Latent Space</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in vision-language tasks such as reasoning segmentation, where models generate segmentation masks based on textual queries. While prior work has primarily focused on perturbing image inputs, semantically equivalent textual paraphrases-crucial in real-world applications where users express the same intent in varied ways-remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases, we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models. We reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under strict semantic and grammatical constraints. All code and data will be released publicly upon acceptance.

<title>Local Performance vs. Out-of-Distribution Generalization: An Empirical Analysis of Personalized Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Data Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24503</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments, local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples, which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU), extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions, including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce GroundLoc, a LiDAR-only localization pipeline designed to localize a mobile robot in large-scale outdoor environments using prior maps. GroundLoc employs a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) image projection focusing on the perceived ground area and utilizes the place recognition network R2D2, or alternatively, the non-learning approach Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), to identify and select keypoints for BEV image map registration. Our results demonstrate that GroundLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI and HeLiPR datasets across various sensors. In the multi-session localization evaluation, GroundLoc reaches an Average Trajectory Error (ATE) well below 50 cm on all Ouster OS2 128 sequences while meeting online runtime requirements. The system supports various sensor models, as evidenced by evaluations conducted with Velodyne HDL-64E, Ouster OS2 128, Aeva Aeries II, and Livox Avia sensors. The prior maps are stored as 2D raster image maps, which can be created from a single drive and require only 4 MB of storage per square kilometer.

Abstract: Customized text-to-video generation aims to generate high-quality videos guided by text prompts and subject references. Current approaches for personalizing text-to-video generation suffer from tackling multiple subjects, which is a more challenging and practical scenario. In this work, our aim is to promote multi-subject guided text-to-video customization. We propose CustomVideo, a novel framework that can generate identity-preserving videos with the guidance of multiple subjects. To be specific, firstly, we encourage the co-occurrence of multiple subjects via composing them in a single image. Further, upon a basic text-to-video diffusion model, we design a simple yet effective attention control strategy to disentangle different subjects in the latent space of diffusion model. Moreover, to help the model focus on the specific area of the object, we segment the object from given reference images and provide a corresponding object mask for attention learning. Also, we collect a multi-subject text-to-video generation dataset as a comprehensive benchmark. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user study results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has emerged as a prominent research area in computer vision. However, little attention has been paid to the fusion task in complex scenes, leading to sub-optimal results under interference. To fill this gap, we propose a unified framework for infrared and visible images fusion in complex scenes, termed UMCFuse. Specifically, we classify the pixels of visible images from the degree of scattering of light transmission, allowing us to separate fine details from overall intensity. Maintaining a balance between interference removal and detail preservation is essential for the generalization capacity of the proposed method. Therefore, we propose an adaptive denoising strategy for the fusion of detail layers. Meanwhile, we fuse the energy features from different modalities by analyzing them from multiple directions. Extensive fusion experiments on real and synthetic complex scenes datasets cover adverse weather conditions, noise, blur, overexposure, fire, as well as downstream tasks including semantic segmentation, object detection, salient object detection, and depth estimation, consistently indicate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the recent representative methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ixilai/UMCFuse.

<title>RETTA: Retrieval-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation for Zero-Shot Video Captioning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Despite the significant progress of fully-supervised video captioning, zero-shot methods remain much less explored. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video captioning framework named Retrieval-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (RETTA), which takes advantage of existing pretrained large-scale vision and language models to directly generate captions with test-time adaptation. Specifically, we bridge video and text using four key models: a general video-text retrieval model XCLIP, a general image-text matching model CLIP, a text alignment model AnglE, and a text generation model GPT-2, due to their source-code availability. The main challenge is how to enable the text generation model to be sufficiently aware of the content in a given video so as to generate corresponding captions. To address this problem, we propose using learnable tokens as a communication medium among these four frozen models GPT-2, XCLIP, CLIP, and AnglE. Different from the conventional way that trains these tokens with training data, we propose to learn these tokens with soft targets of the inference data under several carefully crafted loss functions, which enable the tokens to absorb video information catered for GPT-2. This procedure can be efficiently done in just a few iterations (we use 16 iterations in the experiments) and does not require ground truth data. Extensive experimental results on three widely used datasets, MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX, show absolute 5.1%-32.4% improvements in terms of the main metric CIDEr compared to several state-of-the-art zero-shot video captioning methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2405.20336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a challenging task for simultaneously generating 3D holistic body motions and singing vocals directly from textual lyrics inputs, advancing beyond existing works that typically address these two modalities in isolation. To facilitate this, we first collect the RapVerse dataset, a large dataset containing synchronous rapping vocals, lyrics, and high-quality 3D holistic body meshes. With the RapVerse dataset, we investigate the extent to which scaling autoregressive multimodal transformers across language, audio, and motion can enhance the coherent and realistic generation of vocals and whole-body human motions. For modality unification, a vector-quantized variational autoencoder is employed to encode whole-body motion sequences into discrete motion tokens, while a vocal-to-unit model is leveraged to obtain quantized audio tokens preserving content, prosodic information and singer identity. By jointly performing transformer modeling on these three modalities in a unified way, our framework ensures a seamless and realistic blend of vocals and human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified generation framework not only produces coherent and realistic singing vocals alongside human motions directly from textual inputs, but also rivals the performance of specialized single-modality generation systems, establishing new benchmarks for joint vocal-motion generation.

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth estimation has received widespread attention because of its capability to train without ground truth. In real-world scenarios, the images may be blurry or noisy due to the influence of weather conditions and inherent limitations of the camera. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop a robust depth estimation model. Benefiting from the training strategies of generative networks, generative-based methods often exhibit enhanced robustness. In light of this, we employ a well-converging diffusion model among generative networks for unsupervised monocular depth estimation. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical feature-guided denoising module. This model significantly enriches the model's capacity for learning and interpreting depth distribution by fully leveraging image features to guide the denoising process. Furthermore, we explore the implicit depth within reprojection and design an implicit depth consistency loss. This loss function serves to enhance the performance of the model and ensure the scale consistency of depth within a video sequence. We conduct experiments on the KITTI, Make3D, and our self-collected SIMIT datasets. The results indicate that our approach stands out among generative-based models, while also showcasing remarkable robustness.

Abstract: Navigating towards fully open language goals and exploring open scenes in an intelligent way have always raised significant challenges. Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities to reason with both language and visual data. Although many works have focused on leveraging VLMs for navigation in open scenes, they often require high computational cost, rely on object-centric approaches, or depend on environmental priors in detailed human instructions. We introduce Navigation with VLM (NavVLM), a training-free framework that harnesses open-source VLMs to enable robots to navigate effectively, even for human-friendly language goal such as abstract places, actions, or specific objects in open scenes. NavVLM leverages the VLM as its cognitive core to perceive environmental information and constantly provides exploration guidance achieving intelligent navigation with only a neat target rather than a detailed instruction with environment prior. We evaluated and validated NavVLM in both simulation and real-world experiments. In simulation, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) on object-specifc tasks in richly detailed environments from Matterport 3D (MP3D), Habitat Matterport 3D (HM3D) and Gibson. With navigation episode reported, NavVLM demonstrates the capabilities to navigate towards any open-set languages. In real-world validation, we validated our framework's effectiveness in real-world robot at indoor scene.

Abstract: Detection of anomaly events is relevant for public safety and requires a combination of fine-grained motion information and contextual events at variable time-scales. To this end, we propose a Multi-Timescale Feature Learning (MTFL) method to enhance the representation of anomaly features. Short, medium, and long temporal tubelets are employed to extract spatio-temporal video features using a Video Swin Transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that MTFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the UCF-Crime dataset, achieving an anomaly detection performance 89.78% AUC. Moreover, it performs complementary to SotA with 95.32% AUC on the ShanghaiTech and 84.57% AP on the XD-Violence dataset. Furthermore, we generate an extended dataset of the UCF-Crime for development and evaluation on a wider range of anomalies, namely Video Anomaly Detection Dataset (VADD), involving 2,591 videos in 18 classes with extensive coverage of realistic anomalies.

Abstract: Topological correctness is critical for segmentation of tubular structures, which pervade in biomedical images. Existing topological segmentation loss functions are primarily based on the persistent homology of the image. They match the persistent features from the segmentation with the persistent features from the ground truth and minimize the difference between them. However, these methods suffer from an ambiguous matching problem since the matching only relies on the information in the topological space. In this work, we propose an effective and efficient Spatial-Aware Topological Loss Function that further leverages the information in the original spatial domain of the image to assist the matching of persistent features. Extensive experiments on images of various types of tubular structures show that the proposed method has superior performance in improving the topological accuracy of the segmentation compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable abilities in generating realistic and high-quality images from text prompts. However, a trained model remains largely black-box; little do we know about the roles of its components in exhibiting a concept such as objects or styles. Recent works employ causal tracing to localize knowledge-storing layers in generative models without showing how other layers contribute to the target concept. In this work, we approach diffusion models' interpretability problem from a more general perspective and pose a question: \textit{``How do model components work jointly to demonstrate knowledge?''}. To answer this question, we decompose diffusion models using component attribution, systematically unveiling the importance of each component (specifically the model parameter) in generating a concept. The proposed framework, called \textbf{C}omponent \textbf{A}ttribution for \textbf{D}iffusion Model (CAD), discovers the localization of concept-inducing (positive) components, while interestingly uncovers another type of components that contribute negatively to generating a concept, which is missing in the previous knowledge localization work. Based on this holistic understanding of diffusion models, we introduce two fast, inference-time model editing algorithms, CAD-Erase and CAD-Amplify; in particular, CAD-Erase enables erasure and CAD-Amplify allows amplification of a generated concept by ablating the positive and negative components, respectively, while retaining knowledge of other concepts. Extensive experimental results validate the significance of both positive and negative components pinpointed by our framework, demonstrating the potential of providing a complete view of interpreting generative models.

Abstract: In medical imaging, developing generalized segmentation models that can handle multiple organs and lesions is crucial. However, the scarcity of fully annotated datasets and strict privacy regulations present significant barriers to data sharing. Federated Learning (FL) allows decentralized model training, but existing FL methods often struggle with partial labeling, leading to model divergence and catastrophic forgetting. We propose ConDistFL, a novel FL framework incorporating conditional distillation to address these challenges. ConDistFL enables effective learning from partially labeled datasets, significantly improving segmentation accuracy across distributed and non-uniform datasets. In addition to its superior segmentation performance, ConDistFL maintains computational and communication efficiency, ensuring its scalability for real-world applications. Furthermore, ConDistFL demonstrates remarkable generalizability, significantly outperforming existing FL methods in out-of-federation tests, even adapting to unseen contrast phases (e.g., non-contrast CT images) in our experiments. Extensive evaluations on 3D CT and 2D chest X-ray datasets show that ConDistFL is an efficient, adaptable solution for collaborative medical image segmentation in privacy-constrained settings.

Abstract: Video large language models (Video-LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding videos. However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy visual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context length cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant frames hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial. This paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles: query relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such as uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these principles. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with dynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and model-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the query using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert space~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the similarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To incorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each segment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov decision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments. Theoretically, MDP3 provides a \((1 - 1/e)\)-approximate solution to the NP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time complexity, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, MDP3 significantly outperforms existing methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce Long-VITA, a simple yet effective large multi-modal model for long-context visual-language understanding tasks. It is adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, and text over 4K frames or 1M tokens while delivering advanced performances on short-context multi-modal tasks. We propose an effective multi-modal training schema that starts with large language models and proceeds through vision-language alignment, general knowledge learning, and two sequential stages of long-sequence fine-tuning. We further implement context-parallelism distributed inference and logits-masked language modeling head to scale Long-VITA to infinitely long inputs of images and texts during model inference. Regarding training data, Long-VITA is built on a mix of 17M samples from public datasets only and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various multi-modal benchmarks, compared against recent cutting-edge models with internal data. Long-VITA is fully open-source and reproducible.. By leveraging our inference designs, Long-VITA models achieve a remarkable 2x prefill speedup and 4x context length extension in a single node with 8 GPUs. We hope Long-VITA can serve as a competitive baseline and offer valuable insights for the open-source community in advancing long-context multi-modal understanding.

Abstract: Building AI systems, including Facial Expression Recognition (FER), involves two critical aspects: data and model design. Both components significantly influence bias and fairness in FER tasks. Issues related to bias and fairness in FER datasets and models remain underexplored. This study investigates bias sources in FER datasets and models. Four common FER datasets--AffectNet, ExpW, Fer2013, and RAF-DB--are analyzed. The findings demonstrate that AffectNet and ExpW exhibit high generalizability despite data imbalances. Additionally, this research evaluates the bias and fairness of six deep models, including three state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models: MobileNet, ResNet, XceptionNet, as well as three transformer-based models: ViT, CLIP, and GPT-4o-mini. Experimental results reveal that while GPT-4o-mini and ViT achieve the highest accuracy scores, they also display the highest levels of bias. These findings underscore the urgent need for developing new methodologies to mitigate bias and ensure fairness in datasets and models, particularly in affective computing applications. See our implementation details at https://github.com/MMHosseini/bias_in_FER.

<title>Frequency-Aware Vision Transformers for High-Fidelity Super-Resolution of Earth System Models</title>

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is crucial for enhancing the spatial fidelity of Earth System Model (ESM) outputs, allowing fine-scale structures vital to climate science to be recovered from coarse simulations. However, traditional deep super-resolution methods, including convolutional and transformer-based models, tend to exhibit spectral bias, reconstructing low-frequency content more readily than valuable high-frequency details. In this work, we introduce two frequency-aware frameworks: the Vision Transformer-Tuned Sinusoidal Implicit Representation (ViSIR), combining Vision Transformers and sinusoidal activations to mitigate spectral bias, and the Vision Transformer Fourier Representation Network (ViFOR), which integrates explicit Fourier-based filtering for independent low- and high-frequency learning. Evaluated on the E3SM-HR Earth system dataset across surface temperature, shortwave, and longwave fluxes, these models outperform leading CNN, GAN, and vanilla transformer baselines, with ViFOR demonstrating up to 2.6~dB improvements in PSNR and significantly higher SSIM. Detailed ablation and scaling studies highlight the benefit of full-field training, the impact of frequency hyperparameters, and the potential for generalization. The results establish ViFOR as a state-of-the-art, scalable solution for climate data downscaling. Future extensions will address temporal super-resolution, multimodal climate variables, automated parameter selection, and integration of physical conservation constraints to broaden scientific applicability.

Despite significant progress in AI and computer vision (CV), there remains a lack of benchmarks for assessing models' abilities to infer latent causality from complex visual data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{Causal3D}}, a novel and comprehensive benchmark that integrates structured data (tables) with corresponding visual representations (images) to evaluate causal reasoning. Designed within a systematic framework, Causal3D comprises 19 3D-scene datasets capturing diverse causal relations, views, and backgrounds, enabling evaluations across scenes of varying complexity. We assess multiple state-of-the-art methods, including classical causal discovery, causal representation learning, and large/vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). Our experiments show that as causal structures grow more complex without prior knowledge, performance declines significantly, highlighting the challenges even advanced methods face in complex causal scenarios. Causal3D serves as a vital resource for advancing causal reasoning in CV and fostering trustworthy AI in critical domains.

Abstract: The turning distance is a well-studied metric for measuring the similarity between two polygons. This metric is constructed by taking an $L^p$ distance between step functions which track each shape's tangent angle of a path tracing its boundary. In this study, we introduce \textit{turning disorders} for polygonal planar networks, defined by averaging turning distances between network faces and "ordered" shapes (regular polygons or circles). We derive closed-form expressions of turning distances for special classes of regular polygons, related to the divisibility of $m$ and $n$, and also between regular polygons and circles. These formulas are used to show that the time for computing the 2-turning distances reduces to $O((m+n) \log(m+n))$ when both shapes are regular polygons, an improvement from $O(mn\log(mn))$ operations needed to compute distances between general polygons of $n$ and $m$ sides. We also apply these formulas to several examples of network microstructure with varying disorder. For Archimedean lattices, a class of regular tilings, we can express turning disorders with exact expressions. We also consider turning disorders applied to two examples of stochastic processes on networks: spring networks evolving under T1 moves and polygonal rupture processes. We find that the two aspects of defining different turning disorders, the choice of ordered shape and whether to apply area-weighting, can capture different notions of network disorder.

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates complementary information from diverse modalities to enhance the decision-making process. However, the potential of multimodal collaboration remains under-exploited due to disparities in data quality and modality representation capabilities. To address this, we introduce DynCIM, a novel dynamic curriculum learning framework designed to quantify the inherent imbalances from both sample and modality perspectives. DynCIM employs a sample-level curriculum to dynamically assess each sample's difficulty according to prediction deviation, consistency, and stability, while a modality-level curriculum measures modality contributions from global and local. Furthermore, a gating-based dynamic fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust modality contributions, minimizing redundancy and optimizing fusion effectiveness. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarking datasets, spanning both bimodal and trimodal scenarios, demonstrate that DynCIM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach effectively mitigates modality and sample imbalances while enhancing adaptability and robustness in multimodal learning tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Raymond-Qiancx/DynCIM.

<title>Stealthy Patch-Wise Backdoor Attack in 3D Point Cloud via Curvature Awareness</title>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks (DNNs) by implanting hidden backdoors that can be activated with predefined triggers to manipulate model behaviors maliciously. Existing 3D point cloud backdoor attacks primarily rely on sample-wise global modifications, which suffer from low imperceptibility. Although optimization can improve stealthiness, optimizing sample-wise triggers significantly increases computational cost. To address these limitations, we propose the Stealthy Patch-Wise Backdoor Attack (SPBA), the first patch-wise backdoor attack framework for 3D point clouds. Specifically, SPBA decomposes point clouds into local patches and employs a curvature-based imperceptibility score to guide trigger injection into visually less sensitive patches. By optimizing a unified patch-wise trigger that perturbs spectral features of selected patches, SPBA significantly enhances optimization efficiency while maintaining high stealthiness. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart further demonstrate that SPBA surpasses prior state-of-the-art backdoor attacks in both attack effectiveness and resistance to defense methods. The code is available at https://github.com/HazardFY/SPBA.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OvOD) is set to revolutionize security screening by enabling systems to recognize any item in X-ray scans. However, developing effective OvOD models for X-ray imaging presents unique challenges due to data scarcity and the modality gap that prevents direct adoption of RGB-based solutions. To overcome these limitations, we propose RAXO, a training-free framework that repurposes off-the-shelf RGB OvOD detectors for robust X-ray detection. RAXO builds high-quality X-ray class descriptors using a dual-source retrieval strategy. It gathers relevant RGB images from the web and enriches them via a novel X-ray material transfer mechanism, eliminating the need for labeled databases. These visual descriptors replace text-based classification in OvOD, leveraging intra-modal feature distances for robust detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAXO consistently improves OvOD performance, providing an average mAP increase of up to 17.0 points over base detectors. To further support research in this emerging field, we also introduce DET-COMPASS, a new benchmark featuring bounding box annotations for over 300 object categories, enabling large-scale evaluation of OvOD in X-ray.

Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing encompasses two major directions: data interpretation and parameter inversion. However, both directions rely heavily on costly and labor-intensive labeled data and field measurements, which constrains their scalability and spatiotemporal adaptability. Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) provides a unified framework to address these limitations. This paper departs from the traditional view that treats interpretation and inversion as separate tasks and offers a systematic review of recent advances in LiDAR remote sensing from a unified WSL perspective. We cover typical WSL settings including incomplete supervision(e.g., sparse point labels), inexact supervision (e.g., scene-level tags), inaccurate supervision (e.g., noisy labels), and cross-domain supervision (e.g., domain adaptation/generalization) and corresponding techniques such as pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, self-training, and label refinement, which collectively enable robust learning from limited and weak annotations.We further analyze LiDAR-specific challenges (e.g., irregular geometry, data sparsity, domain heterogeneity) that require tailored weak supervision, and examine how sparse LiDAR observations can guide joint learning with other remote-sensing data for continuous surface-parameter retrieval. Finally, we highlight future directions where WSL acts as a bridge between LiDAR and foundation models to leverage large-scale multimodal datasets and reduce labeling costs, while also enabling broader WSL-driven advances in generalization, open-world adaptation, and scalable LiDAR remote sensing.

Abstract: Omnidirectional depth perception is essential for mobile robotics applications that require scene understanding across a full 360{\deg} field of view. Camera-based setups offer a cost-effective option by using stereo depth estimation to generate dense, high-resolution depth maps without relying on expensive active sensing. However, existing omnidirectional stereo matching approaches achieve only limited depth accuracy across diverse environments, depth ranges, and lighting conditions, due to the scarcity of real-world data. We present DFI-OmniStereo, a novel omnidirectional stereo matching method that leverages a large-scale pre-trained foundation model for relative monocular depth estimation within an iterative optimization-based stereo matching architecture. We introduce a dedicated two-stage training strategy to utilize the relative monocular depth features for our omnidirectional stereo matching before scale-invariant fine-tuning. DFI-OmniStereo achieves state-of-the-art results on the real-world Helvipad dataset, reducing disparity MAE by approximately 16% compared to the previous best omnidirectional stereo method.

Abstract: Generative models can reconstruct face images from encoded representations (templates) bearing remarkable likeness to the original face, raising security and privacy concerns. We present \textsc{FaceCloak}, a neural network framework that protects face templates by generating smart, renewable binary cloaks. Our method proactively thwarts inversion attacks by cloaking face templates with unique disruptors synthesized from a single face template on the fly while provably retaining biometric utility and unlinkability. Our cloaked templates can suppress sensitive attributes while generalizing to novel feature extraction schemes and outperform leading baselines in terms of biometric matching and resiliency to reconstruction attacks. \textsc{FaceCloak}-based matching is extremely fast (inference time =0.28 ms) and light (0.57 MB). We have released our \href{https://github.com/sudban3089/FaceCloak.git}{code} for reproducible research.

Abstract: CLIP has emerged as a powerful multimodal model capable of connecting images and text through joint embeddings, but to what extent does it 'see' the same way humans do - especially when interpreting artworks? In this paper, we investigate CLIP's ability to extract high-level semantic and stylistic information from paintings, including both human-created and AI-generated imagery. We evaluate its perception across multiple dimensions: content, scene understanding, artistic style, historical period, and the presence of visual deformations or artifacts. By designing targeted probing tasks and comparing CLIP's responses to human annotations and expert benchmarks, we explore its alignment with human perceptual and contextual understanding. Our findings reveal both strengths and limitations in CLIP's visual representations, particularly in relation to aesthetic cues and artistic intent. We further discuss the implications of these insights for using CLIP as a guidance mechanism during generative processes, such as style transfer or prompt-based image synthesis. Our work highlights the need for deeper interpretability in multimodal systems, especially when applied to creative domains where nuance and subjectivity play a central role.

Abstract: Facial recognition systems have achieved remarkable success by leveraging deep neural networks, advanced loss functions, and large-scale datasets. However, their performance often deteriorates in real-world scenarios involving low-quality facial images. Such degradations, common in surveillance footage or standoff imaging include low resolution, motion blur, and various distortions, resulting in a substantial domain gap from the high-quality data typically used during training. While existing approaches attempt to address robustness by modifying network architectures or modeling global spatial transformations, they frequently overlook local, non-rigid deformations that are inherently present in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce \textbf{DArFace}, a \textbf{D}eformation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{r}obust \textbf{Face} recognition framework that enhances robustness to such degradations without requiring paired high- and low-quality training samples. Our method adversarially integrates both global transformations (e.g., rotation, translation) and local elastic deformations during training to simulate realistic low-quality conditions. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive objective to enforce identity consistency across different deformed views. Extensive evaluations on low-quality benchmarks including TinyFace, IJB-B, and IJB-C demonstrate that DArFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with significant gains attributed to the inclusion of local deformation modeling.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises safety concerns under potential malicious inputs. However, existing multimodal safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48 fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration. Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to identify, track and segment the objects in a video based on language descriptions, which has received great attention in recent years. However, existing datasets remain focus on short video clips within several seconds, with salient objects visible in most frames. To advance the task towards more practical scenarios, we introduce \textbf{Long-RVOS}, a large-scale benchmark for long-term referring video object segmentation. Long-RVOS contains 2,000+ videos of an average duration exceeding 60 seconds, covering a variety of objects that undergo occlusion, disappearance-reappearance and shot changing. The objects are manually annotated with three different types of descriptions to individually evaluate the understanding of static attributes, motion patterns and spatiotemporal relationships. Moreover, unlike previous benchmarks that rely solely on the per-frame spatial evaluation, we introduce two new metrics to assess the temporal and spatiotemporal consistency. We benchmark 6 state-of-the-art methods on Long-RVOS. The results show that current approaches struggle severely with the long-video challenges. To address this, we further propose ReferMo, a promising baseline method that integrates motion information to expand the temporal receptive field, and employs a local-to-global architecture to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies. Despite simplicity, ReferMo achieves significant improvements over current methods in long-term scenarios. We hope that Long-RVOS and our baseline can drive future RVOS research towards tackling more realistic and long-form videos.

Abstract: Understanding people's preferences is crucial for urban planning, yet current approaches often combine responses from multi-cultural populations, obscuring demographic differences and risking amplifying biases. We conducted a largescale urban visual perception survey of streetscapes worldwide using street view imagery, examining how demographics -- including gender, age, income, education, race and ethnicity, and personality traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants with balanced demographics from five countries and 45 nationalities. This dataset, Street Perception Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics (SPECS), reveals demographic- and personality-based differences across six traditional indicators -- safe, lively, wealthy, beautiful, boring, depressing -- and four new ones -- live nearby, walk, cycle, green. Location-based sentiments further shape these preferences. Machine learning models trained on existing global datasets tend to overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative ones compared to human responses, underscoring the need for local context. Our study aspires to rectify the myopic treatment of street perception, which rarely considers demographics or personality traits.

Abstract: Aiming to generalize the well-trained gaze estimation model to new target domains, Cross-domain Gaze Estimation (CDGE) is developed for real-world application scenarios. Existing CDGE methods typically extract the domain-invariant features to mitigate domain shift in feature space, which is proved insufficient by Generalized Label Shift (GLS) theory. In this paper, we introduce a novel GLS perspective to CDGE and modelize the cross-domain problem by label and conditional shift problem. A GLS correction framework is presented and a feasible realization is proposed, in which a importance reweighting strategy based on truncated Gaussian distribution is introduced to overcome the continuity challenges in label shift correction. To embed the reweighted source distribution to conditional invariant learning, we further derive a probability-aware estimation of conditional operator discrepancy. Extensive experiments on standard CDGE tasks with different backbone models validate the superior generalization capability across domain and applicability on various models of proposed method.

Abstract: Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable, hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both} training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling of video diffusion models. Code will be available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo.

Abstract: Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems. Resources available at: https://yunlong10.github.io/MMPerspective/

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of numerous foundation models. These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics pathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI based on observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales. Additionally, we construct PathMMU-HR2, the first expert-validated benchmark for large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is challenged by limited interpretability, which significantly impacts cross-dataset generalization. To address this challenge, we propose Motion-Primitive Transformer (MoPFormer), a novel self-supervised framework that enhances interpretability by tokenizing inertial measurement unit signals into semantically meaningful motion primitives and leverages a Transformer architecture to learn rich temporal representations. MoPFormer comprises two stages. The first stage is to partition multi-channel sensor streams into short segments and quantize them into discrete ``motion primitive'' codewords, while the second stage enriches those tokenized sequences through a context-aware embedding module and then processes them with a Transformer encoder. The proposed MoPFormer can be pre-trained using a masked motion-modeling objective that reconstructs missing primitives, enabling it to develop robust representations across diverse sensor configurations. Experiments on six HAR benchmarks demonstrate that MoPFormer not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also successfully generalizes across multiple datasets. More importantly, the learned motion primitives significantly enhance both interpretability and cross-dataset performance by capturing fundamental movement patterns that remain consistent across similar activities, regardless of dataset origin.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Online Multimodal Conversational Response Generation (OMCRG), a novel task designed to produce synchronized verbal and non-verbal listener feedback online, based on the speaker's multimodal inputs. OMCRG captures natural dyadic interactions and introduces new challenges in aligning generated audio with listeners' facial responses. To tackle these challenges, we incorporate text as an intermediate modality to connect audio and facial responses. We propose OmniResponse, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that autoregressively generates accurate multimodal listener responses. OmniResponse leverages a pretrained LLM enhanced with two core components: Chrono-Text Markup, which precisely timestamps generated text tokens, and TempoVoice, a controllable online text-to-speech (TTS) module that outputs speech synchronized with facial responses. To advance OMCRG research, we offer ResponseNet, a dataset of 696 detailed dyadic interactions featuring synchronized split-screen videos, multichannel audio, transcripts, and annotated facial behaviors. Comprehensive evaluations on ResponseNet demonstrate that OmniResponse outperforms baseline models in terms of semantic speech content, audio-visual synchronization, and generation quality. Our dataset, code, and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent progress in Sign Language Translation (SLT) has focussed primarily on improving the representational capacity of large language models to incorporate Sign Language features. This work explores an alternative direction: enhancing the geometric properties of skeletal representations themselves. We propose Geo-Sign, a method that leverages the properties of hyperbolic geometry to model the hierarchical structure inherent in sign language kinematics. By projecting skeletal features derived from Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCNs) into the Poincar\'e ball model, we aim to create more discriminative embeddings, particularly for fine-grained motions like finger articulations. We introduce a hyperbolic projection layer, a weighted Fr\'echet mean aggregation scheme, and a geometric contrastive loss operating directly in hyperbolic space. These components are integrated into an end-to-end translation framework as a regularisation function, to enhance the representations within the language model. This work demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic geometry to improve skeletal representations for Sign Language Translation, improving on SOTA RGB methods while preserving privacy and improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in 3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,886 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, individual objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best-performing models, Google Gemini-2.5-Pro and OpenAI o3, achieve just around 30% accuracy on space-level tasks and around 40% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models' capacity to understand and reason about 3D scenes beyond object-level semantics.

Abstract: Traditional SLAM algorithms excel at camera tracking, but typically produce incomplete and low-resolution maps that are not tightly integrated with semantics prediction. Recent work integrates Gaussian Splatting (GS) into SLAM to enable dense, photorealistic 3D mapping, yet existing GS-based SLAM methods require per-scene optimization that is slow and consumes an excessive number of Gaussians. We present GS4, the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM system. Compared with prior approaches, GS4 runs 10x faster, uses 10x fewer Gaussians, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across color, depth, semantic mapping and camera tracking. From an RGB-D video stream, GS4 incrementally builds and updates a set of 3D Gaussians using a feed-forward network. First, the Gaussian Prediction Model estimates a sparse set of Gaussian parameters from input frame, which integrates both color and semantic prediction with the same backbone. Then, the Gaussian Refinement Network merges new Gaussians with the existing set while avoiding redundancy. Finally, we propose to optimize GS for only 1-5 iterations that corrects drift and floaters when significant pose changes are detected. Experiments on the real-world ScanNet and ScanNet++ benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance, with strong generalization capability shown through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

Abstract: Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images. While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to understand and trust model outputs. To address these limitations, this work first proposes a Region-Aware Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (RMCoT) dataset, in which the process of producing an answer is preceded by a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal. The dataset is available at https://www.med-vqa.com/GEMeX/.

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities, 28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

<title>Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion: Bridging Shared and Cross-Parametric Interactions for Object Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14643</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.14643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern multispectral feature fusion for object detection faces two critical limitations: (1) Excessive preference for local complementary features over cross-modal shared semantics adversely affects generalization performance; and (2) The trade-off between the receptive field size and computational complexity present critical bottlenecks for scalable feature modeling. Addressing these issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its generality. The source code will be available at https://github.com/61s61min/MS2Fusion.git.

<title>Towards Real Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Via Confident Meta-Learning</title>

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning, which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data. CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2 with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all datasets.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP. By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization, outperforming competing models.

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning aims to generate segmentation masks in remote sensing imagery directly from natural-language instructions. Most existing approaches follow a paradigm that fine-tunes multimodal large language models under supervision with dense pixel-level masks as ground truth. While effective within the training data distribution, this design suffers from two main drawbacks: (1) the high cost of large-scale dense mask annotation, and (2) the limited generalization capability of supervised fine-tuning in out-of-domain scenarios. To address these issues, we propose GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework that integrates a multimodal large language model with a pretrained segmentation model in a cascaded manner. To enhance generalization, we introduce PRIME, a training paradigm that replaces supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to better align reasoning and grounding behaviors with task objectives. To reduce annotation costs, we design BoP-Rewards, which substitutes dense mask labels with bounding box and positive points. It further verifies outputs through two complementary signals: format, which constrains the reasoning and grounding structure to remain syntactically parsable, and accuracy, which evaluates the quality of predicted boxes and points. For evaluation, we train our method and all baselines on EarthReason and GeoPixInstruct, constructing an in-domain benchmark by merging their test sets. We further release GRASP-1k, a fully out-of-domain benchmark with reasoning-intensive queries, reasoning traces, and fine-grained masks. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) in-domain performance and up to 54\% improvement in out-of-domain scenarios, confirming that reinforcement learning with cost-aware rewards provides a robust and scalable paradigm for geospatial pixel reasoning. All code and datasets will be released publicly.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions into robot actions. However, prevailing VLAs either generate actions auto-regressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach separate MLP or diffusion heads outside the backbone, leading to fragmented information pathways and specialized training requirements that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a unified-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary re-masking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pre-trained vision-language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. success rates on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv-Fractal and 54.2% overall on SimplerEnv-Bridge, improving over autoregressive, MLP decoder and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion VLA supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images. Recent advancements in Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation have leveraged positional conditions and textual descriptions to facilitate precise and controllable image synthesis. Despite overall progress, current L2I methods still exhibit suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose InstanceAssemble, a novel architecture that incorporates layout conditions via instance-assembling attention, enabling position control with bounding boxes (bbox) and multimodal content control including texts and additional visual content. Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse style LoRA modules. The code and pretrained models are publicly available at https://github.com/FireRedTeam/InstanceAssemble.

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, \ie, automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four modalities.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and treatment but remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance. However, despite their computational efficiency over other neural architectures, they incur considerable overhead for this task due to their sequential feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address this, we first propose a dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that improves robustness. We further propose five systematic folds on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse conditions and present analysis of common failure scenarios. On the 20% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of 0.10% for whole tumor, 1.75% for tumor core, and 0.93% for enhancing tumor. Evaluations on the proposed systematic folds demonstrate that our model maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice gains of 1.16% for tumor core and 1.68% for enhancing tumor over existing state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model achieves a 15x efficiency improvement while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its robustness and computational advantage over existing methods.

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations, including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled, disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding, where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and models will be released.

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations, segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements across diverse medical vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

<title>One-Step is Enough: Sparse Autoencoders for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.

<title>ADMN: A Layer-Wise Adaptive Multimodal Network for Dynamic Input Noise and Compute Resources</title>

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning systems are deployed in dynamic scenarios due to the robustness afforded by multiple sensing modalities. Nevertheless, they struggle with varying compute resource availability (due to multi-tenancy, device heterogeneity, etc.) and fluctuating quality of inputs (from sensor feed corruption, environmental noise, etc.). Statically provisioned multimodal systems cannot adapt when compute resources change over time, while existing dynamic networks struggle with strict compute budgets. Additionally, both systems often neglect the impact of variations in modality quality. Consequently, modalities suffering substantial corruption may needlessly consume resources better allocated towards other modalities. We propose ADMN, a layer-wise Adaptive Depth Multimodal Network capable of tackling both challenges: it adjusts the total number of active layers across all modalities to meet strict compute resource constraints and continually reallocates layers across input modalities according to their modality quality. Our evaluations showcase ADMN can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art networks while reducing up to 75% of their floating-point operations.

<title>Acoustic Neural 3D Reconstruction Under Pose Drift</title>

arXiv:2503.08930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing neural implicit surfaces for 3D reconstruction using acoustic images collected with drifting sensor poses. The accuracy of current state-of-the-art 3D acoustic modeling algorithms is highly dependent on accurate pose estimation; small errors in sensor pose can lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the neural scene representation and sonar poses. Our algorithm does so by parameterizing the 6DoF poses as learnable parameters and backpropagating gradients through the neural renderer and implicit representation. We validated our algorithm on both real and simulated datasets. It produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions even under significant pose drift.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities in classification and retrieval. However, these models often struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance. Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++.

<title>GaussianFusion: Gaussian-Based Multi-Sensor Fusion for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion is crucial for improving the performance and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing methods predominantly adopt either attention-based flatten fusion or bird's eye view fusion through geometric transformations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited interpretability or dense computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce GaussianFusion, a Gaussian-based multi-sensor fusion framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our method employs intuitive and compact Gaussian representations as intermediate carriers to aggregate information from diverse sensors. Specifically, we initialize a set of 2D Gaussians uniformly across the driving scene, where each Gaussian is parameterized by physical attributes and equipped with explicit and implicit features. These Gaussians are progressively refined by integrating multi-modal features. The explicit features capture rich semantic and spatial information about the traffic scene, while the implicit features provide complementary cues beneficial for trajectory planning. To fully exploit rich spatial and semantic information in Gaussians, we design a cascade planning head that iteratively refines trajectory predictions through interactions with Gaussians. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed GaussianFusion framework. The source code will be released at https://github.com/Say2L/GaussianFusion.

Abstract: Achieving reliable ego motion estimation for agile robots, e.g., aerobatic aircraft, remains challenging because most robot sensors fail to respond timely and clearly to highly dynamic robot motions, often resulting in measurement blurring, distortion, and delays. In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar, First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and efficient velocity output in challenging environments.

<title>Riemannian-Geometric Fingerprints of Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and rapid integration of generative models (GMs) have sparked interest in the problem of model attribution and their fingerprints. For instance, service providers need reliable methods of authenticating their models to protect their IP, while users and law enforcement seek to verify the source of generated content for accountability and trust. In addition, a growing threat of model collapse is arising, as more model-generated data are being fed back into sources (e.g., YouTube) that are often harvested for training ("regurgitative training"), heightening the need to differentiate synthetic from human data. Yet, a gap still exists in understanding generative models' fingerprints, we believe, stemming from the lack of a formal framework that can define, represent, and analyze the fingerprints in a principled way. To address this gap, we take a geometric approach and propose a new definition of artifact and fingerprint of GMs using Riemannian geometry, which allows us to leverage the rich theory of differential geometry. Our new definition generalizes previous work (Song et al., 2024) to non-Euclidean manifolds by learning Riemannian metrics from data and replacing the Euclidean distances and nearest-neighbor search with geodesic distances and kNN-based Riemannian center of mass. We apply our theory to a new gradient-based algorithm for computing the fingerprints in practice. Results show that it is more effective in distinguishing a large array of GMs, spanning across 4 different datasets in 2 different resolutions (64 by 64, 256 by 256), 27 model architectures, and 2 modalities (Vision, Vision-Language). Using our proposed definition significantly improves the performance on model attribution, as well as a generalization to unseen datasets, model types, and modalities, suggesting its practical efficacy.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders, which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided at: https://hcplab-sysu.github.io/TAVP.

Abstract: Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are the primary medium for human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of visual elements, dynamic environments, and the need for multi-step reasoning. Existing methods based on vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from limited resolution, domain mismatch, and insufficient sequential decisionmaking capability. To address these issues, we propose Mano, a robust GUI agent built upon a multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on extensive web and computer system data. Our approach integrates a novel simulated environment for high-fidelity data generation, a three-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning, offline reinforcement learning, and online reinforcement learning), and a verification module for error recovery. Mano demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks, including Mind2Web and OSWorld, achieving significant improvements in success rate and operational accuracy. Our work provides new insights into the effective integration of reinforcement learning with VLMs for practical GUI agent deployment, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data, iterative training, and holistic reward design.

Abstract: As generative models are advancing in quality and quantity for creating synthetic content, deepfakes begin to cause online mistrust. Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy synthetic media detection.

Summary: 
Visionary-R1, a visual language model trained through reinforcement learning, demonstrates the ability to reason on image data without explicit supervision. The model follows a caption-reason-answer format, generating detailed captions for images before constructing reasoning chains. By focusing on interpreting images before reasoning, Visionary-R1 mitigates shortcut learning and outperforms strong multimodal models on visual reasoning benchmarks. This approach enhances the model's generalization across unseen data distributions, showcasing the importance of encouraging detailed image interpretation in reasoning tasks. The findings highlight the potential of reinforcement learning techniques in developing reasoning capabilities in visual language models, paving the way for advancements in AI research and applications.

Abstract: Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging problem in AI. Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models (VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1, outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also designed to verify the flexibility of our method.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward general-purpose embodied agents. However, existing MLLMs do not reliably capture fine-grained links between low-level visual features and high-level textual semantics, leading to weak grounding and inaccurate perception. To overcome this challenge, we propose ESCA, a framework that contextualizes embodied agents by grounding their perception in spatial-temporal scene graphs. At its core is SGCLIP, a novel, open-domain, promptable foundation model for generating scene graphs that is based on CLIP. SGCLIP is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos using a neurosymbolic pipeline that aligns automatically generated captions with scene graphs produced by the model itself, eliminating the need for human-labeled annotations. We demonstrate that SGCLIP excels in both prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results on scene graph generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGCLIP improves perception for embodied agents based on both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state of-the-art performance across two embodied environments. Notably, ESCA significantly reduces agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary baselines. We release the source code for SGCLIP model training at https://github.com/video-fm/LASER and for the embodied agent at https://github.com/video-fm/ESCA.

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans) block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where reliable labels are scarce.

Summary: The article discusses the challenges of applying search strategies to image generation models compared to text generation models. While search strategies have greatly improved language models, they have not had the same success with image generation. The authors demonstrate that the discrete nature of visual autoregressive models allows for effective search in image generation tasks. They show that using beam search significantly enhances text-to-image generation, enabling a smaller autoregressive model to outperform a larger diffusion model in various benchmarks. The advantage of beam search in image generation models comes from the ability to prune early and reuse computations due to the discrete token space. A thorough analysis reveals trade-offs between speed and reasoning capability in the models. These findings emphasize the importance of model architecture, in addition to scale, for optimizing inference-time in visual generation tasks.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult. Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a novel framework called GOOD for generating out-of-distribution (OOD) samples using text-to-image diffusion models. Existing approaches are limited by semantic instability and lack of shift diversity, hindering generalization to realistic OOD. GOOD addresses these issues by providing dual-level guidance: image-level guidance based on log partition gradient to reduce input likelihood and feature-level guidance derived from k-NN distance in the classifier's latent space. This design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample generation. Additionally, a unified OOD score combines image and feature discrepancies for enhanced detection robustness. Through thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses, the effectiveness of GOOD is validated, showing improved OOD detection performance when trained on samples generated by GOOD. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence, this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements have been made in deep learning for medical image segmentation, particularly with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models. However, CNNs face limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer from high computational complexity. To address this, we propose RWKV-UNet, a novel model that integrates the RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) structure into the U-Net architecture. This integration enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and to improve contextual understanding, which is crucial for accurate medical image segmentation. We build a strong encoder with developed Global-Local Spatial Perception (GLSP) blocks combining CNNs and RWKVs. We also propose a Cross-Channel Mix (CCM) module to improve skip connections with multi-scale feature fusion, achieving global channel information integration. Experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that the RWKV-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on various types of medical image segmentation tasks. Additionally, smaller variants, RWKV-UNet-S and RWKV-UNet-T, balance accuracy and computational efficiency, making them suitable for broader clinical applications.

Summary:
RoboRefer is introduced as a 3D-aware Vision Language Model (VLM) that enhances spatial understanding and multi-step reasoning for robots interacting in complex 3D environments. By integrating a dedicated depth encoder through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RoboRefer achieves precise spatial understanding. The model further advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning through reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with tailored reward functions. The RefSpatial dataset, comprising 20 million QA pairs covering 31 spatial relations and supporting complex reasoning processes, facilitates SFT and RFT training. Additionally, the RefSpatial-Bench benchmark evaluates spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, while RFT-trained RoboRefer outperforms other baselines, including Gemini-2.5-Pro, by a significant margin. RoboRefer's capabilities enable integration with various control policies for executing dynamic tasks across diverse robots in cluttered real-world scenes. The project page for RoboRefer provides further information.

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Summary:
- Current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with basic data visualization understanding tasks.
- The study developed FUGU, a suite of tasks, to pinpoint sources of VLM difficulties.
- Errors in VLMs often stem from incorrect data point coordinates.
- Providing correct coordinates improves model performance significantly.
- However, performance worsens for tasks requiring statistical relationships across multiple data points.
- Fine-tuning models on FUGU does not lead to optimal performance, suggesting architectural constraints in current VLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear. Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g., extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder, suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff. We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization understanding.

<div> Keywords: agricultural disease management, vision-language model, self-consistency framework, semantic clustering, PlantVillage dataset

Summary:
This work presents a cost-effective self-consistency framework to enhance the reliability of vision-language models for agricultural image captioning, addressing challenges in developing countries like India, Kenya, and Nigeria. The framework utilizes semantic clustering and a consensus mechanism based on cosine similarity to select the most coherent caption for crop disease images. A human-in-the-loop component is integrated to improve input quality by filtering out erroneous generations. Tested on the PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned model, the framework outperforms standard decoding methods with a peak accuracy of 83.1% when considering single-cluster consensus and 94.0% with multiple clusters. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated by providing accurate diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and prevention recommendations in the generated captions, making it a valuable tool for improving agricultural disease management in resource-constrained settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya, and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model (VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model, our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods. Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10 candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5% achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

Summary:  
ControlNets have been introduced to enhance artistic control in text-to-image diffusion models by offering specialized modules for controlling the spatial and geometric structure of the output. These modules include a proportion ControlNet and a perspective ControlNet, allowing for control over object position, scale, and 3D geometry using bounding boxes and vanishing lines, respectively.

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called H2OFlow that learns 3D Human-Object Interaction (HOI) affordances using only synthetic data. This framework addresses the limitations of current approaches by considering contact, orientation, and spatial occupancy aspects of human-object interactions. H2OFlow leverages a dense 3D-flow-based representation obtained through a diffusion process on point clouds. This approach enables the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for labor-intensive human annotations. The framework demonstrates effective generalization to real-world objects and outperforms prior methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations. H2OFlow signifies a significant advancement in understanding how humans interact with their environment, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for modeling 3D affordances. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation, and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in modeling 3D affordance.

A dataset comprising one million image-text-masks pairs offers precise spatial supervision for local semantic instructions. The model utilizes a pretrained text-to-image model as a backbone with two facial information injection channels: 3D facial rendering for physical characteristics and global facial features. Optimization objectives focus on semantic alignment and perceptual loss to maintain face ID and physical consistency.

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial editing in diverse applications.

Summary:
Compact binary face templates were studied to analyze longitudinal stability and quantify ageing drift in bits per decade. The study compressed float embeddings from a modern face CNN into 64- and 128-bit codes using PCA-ITQ. For 566 identities in the dataset, a linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute age gap was fitted, showing a systematic increase in intra-class distance over time. Shorter codes were found to be more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. The drift scales with code length, affecting operating characteristics such as equal error rate (EER) and true positive rate (TPR). Implications for smart-card and match-on-card deployments were discussed, suggesting periodic re-enrolment and targeted parity on unstable bit positions as potential mitigations. Code and CSV artifacts are provided for reproducibility purposes. <br /><br />Summary:

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for 64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1 percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

This study introduces a deep learning framework for early breast cancer detection using fine needle aspirate (FNA) images. The deep neural network achieves high classification performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score surpassing existing benchmarks. Compared to traditional algorithms, the deep model consistently outperforms on various metrics. To enhance interpretability for clinical use, Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME are incorporated to provide feature-level attributions and visualizations. Insights reveal the importance of concave points feature of cell nuclei in breast tumor classification. The combination of high accuracy and interpretability bridges the gap for potential real-world clinical adoption, enabling improved diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of 0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis, and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key characteristics of breast tumor.

Summary: EdgeSync is a novel approach for updating lightweight edge models in real-time video analytics systems. It addresses the challenges of model accuracy degradation due to changing data features by enhancing sample filtering and optimizing model update timing. By incorporating timeliness and inference results, EdgeSync ensures that training samples are more relevant to the current video content, resulting in a 3.4% improvement in accuracy compared to existing methods and a 10% improvement over traditional approaches. The system reduces update delays and aligns the model with the evolving data distribution of the video stream, making it more effective in adapting to changing environmental conditions. EdgeSync's dynamic training management module optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates, further enhancing the efficiency and timeliness of the edge-model updating process. <div>
arXiv:2510.21781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates; second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync, an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays. Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints -- remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP), bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU (0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs, making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in domain-specific SAM applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the scalability of our method.

Summary:
This paper introduces a method for rigorously quantifying uncertainty in camera pose estimation under dense or learned models. By treating a differentiable renderer as a measurement function, the authors derive a closed-form lower bound on the covariance of pose estimates. Linearizing image formation with respect to small pose perturbations on the manifold results in a render-aware Cram\'er-Rao bound, ensuring continuity with existing vision theory. This approach extends to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. The statistical formulation presented in this work has implications for tasks like cooperative perception and novel view synthesis, without the need for explicit keypoint correspondences. <div>

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit keypoint correspondences.

<div> Keywords: event induction, video event prediction, multimodal event argument node, EventFormer, dataset<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces AVEP (Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that predicts events in videos using complex logic and rich semantic information. A dataset of annotated videos and video clips is presented to support this task, offering fine-grained annotations with multimodal event argument nodes. Traditional visual models are not suitable for AVEP, so the proposed model, EventFormer, uses hierarchical attention to capture event relationships and coreferential relationships. Experimental results show the complexity of the task and the value of the dataset, with the proposed approach outperforming state-of-the-art models. The dataset and code will be released for replication of experiments and annotations. <div>

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP (Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures, traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for replicating the experiments and annotations.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for multimode fiber imaging, addressing the challenge of image reconstruction when the measurement matrix is unknown. By proposing mismatch equations and developing matched and calibration solution algorithms, a new measurement matrix can be constructed for successful image reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the constructed matrix under low noise levels in traditional reconstruction algorithms. The impact of noise, computational precision, and orthogonality on reconstruction performance is analyzed, highlighting the robustness of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms. This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance. The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness. Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory. The code is available: https://github.com/yanglebupt/mismatch-solution.

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion quality.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration (MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided, modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively. The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings, and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial anomaly detection.

<div> framework, vision-language models, alignment, hallucination, token-level inference,
Summary:
The article introduces TITA, a Token-level Inference-Time Alignment framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address hallucination issues. It freezes the base VLM and trains a reward model to approximate its distribution, extracting implicit preference signals as log-probability ratios during inference. This approach, akin to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), provides token-level corrective feedback without retraining the backbone. Evaluation on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B datasets shows consistent performance improvements across 12 benchmarks, with notable gains in MMVet and POPE tasks. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B datasets demonstrate reduced hallucinations and improved VQA accuracy without significant inference overhead. TITA enhances general understanding and reduces hallucination in VLM outputs, offering a lightweight solution to improve multimodal intelligence. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and 6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy, while incurring negligible inference overhead.

<div> Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention, Multi-scale dependencies, Parameter efficiency, State-of-the-art performance, Generalization capabilities  

Summary:  
Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) is proposed to address the limitations of current time series foundation models (TSFMs) in capturing multi-scale dependencies across datasets with divergent patterns. The HIBA architecture, implemented in the scalable Xihe TSFM family ranging from 9.5M to 1.5B parameters, outperforms contemporary models in both parameter efficiency and zero-shot performance on the GIFT-Eval benchmark. The intra- and inter-block sparse attention mechanisms in HIBA facilitate local and global temporal pattern interactions, leading to superior generalization capabilities. Xihe-tiny (9.5M) model demonstrates remarkable efficiency, while Xihe-max (1.5B) achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. This consistent excellence across varying parameter configurations highlights the architectural superiority of HIBA in capturing multi-scale dependencies in time series data.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies. Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and architectural superiority of HIBA.

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow, empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70% of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better match the natural clustering of the video frames.

Summary: 
The study focuses on improving knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis accuracy from radiographs. A novel multimodal framework combining anatomical structure with radiographic features is proposed. This framework integrates a morphological graph representation with a vision encoder, enhancing KOA classification accuracy. By aligning geometry-informed graph embeddings with radiographic features, the model achieves significant improvements. The incorporation of anatomical features into the graph construction introduces morphological priors reflecting clinical assessment criteria, enriching the feature space and bias of the model. Experimental results on the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset show that the proposed approach surpasses single-modality baselines by up to 10% in accuracy, outperforming existing methods by 8% in accuracy and 11% in F1 score. These findings highlight the importance of integrating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for precise KOA severity grading.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations - with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy. By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%), while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and 11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA severity grading.

Summary:
- The study examines the impact of limited denoising steps on image sampling quality using parallel processors.
- Two samplers working in parallel can enhance the quality of the sampled image by integrating information at different times.
- The method is straightforward, model-agnostic, and requires no additional fine-tuning or external models.
- Testing with automated and human evaluations across various diffusion models demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.
- Merely combining information from multiple samplers without proper integration can reduce sample quality, highlighting the importance of the integration process.
- Increasing the number of parallel samplers does not always lead to improved sample quality, indicating a potential trade-off between the number of samplers and sample quality.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps, i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image. Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably, our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play, model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges in text-video retrieval methods, highlighting the need to reduce data acquisition costs and improve cross-modal alignment accuracy. To address these issues, a new framework called FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP) is proposed. This framework utilizes frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, enhancing the focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing static background redundancy. By incorporating these features into the Alpha-CLIP model, the method aims to strike a balance between retrieval efficiency and accuracy in text-video alignment tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving video semantic encoding for better retrieval performance. <div>
arXiv:2510.21806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval efficiency and accuracy.

Summary:
Recent advancements in reasoning models have significantly improved the capabilities of large language models, particularly in tasks with verifiable rewards. However, there is still a gap in adapting these models to real-world multimodal scenarios, such as vision language tasks. Efforts to apply reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have been limited in fully utilizing visual context and commonsense knowledge. To address this limitation, a novel fine-tuning task called Masked Prediction via Context and Commonsense has been introduced, forcing models to integrate visual context and commonsense reasoning. A specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, was developed to evaluate model performance in generalized reasoning. The use of Reinforcement Fine-tuning with Prior Sampling as a training method improves model performance and enhances its generalized reasoning capabilities in out-of-distribution and cross-task scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2510.21807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling, which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). It addresses the challenges faced when applying CLIP to DAZSL, including inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer and degraded cross-modal alignment. The framework integrates a Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention Strategy to enhance the performance of CLIP in DAZSL. SRE-CLIP is the first CLIP-based DAZSL method and achieves state-of-the-art results on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, surpassing existing approaches in the field. <div>

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Summary:
In the field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments, the complexity of action decision systems has led to a need for explainable AI. This paper proposes incorporating the task of describing actions in language into navigation reinforcement learning as an auxiliary task. By leveraging knowledge distillation from pre-trained description generation models like vision-language models, the system can generate action descriptions without ground-truth data. The approach is evaluated across various navigation tasks, achieving high performance in both navigation and action description. In challenging tasks like semantic audio-visual navigation, it attains state-of-the-art performance. This innovation allows for a more transparent and interpretable navigation system, enhancing understanding and trust in the decision-making process. <div>

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models. We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks, demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual navigation.

<div> Keywords: Diabetic Retinopathy, Diabetes Mellitus, Retinal microvasculature, Deep Learning, Feature extraction 

Summary: 
This paper presents a hybrid diagnostic framework for the early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using a combination of traditional feature extraction and deep learning (DL). DR, a complication of Diabetes Mellitus, is a major concern globally, particularly in countries like India with a high diabetic population. By leveraging handcrafted features to capture clinical markers and DL for hierarchical pattern recognition, the model aims to enhance DR detection. The integration of interpretable clinical data with learned features results in a more accurate and scalable screening approach compared to standalone DL methods. Early diagnosis is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages, and untreated symptoms can lead to irreversible vision loss. This multimodal AI-driven approach offers a promising solution for improving DR screening in diabetes-burdened regions.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore, early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial for diabetes-burdened regions.

<br />
Summary: 
The study introduces SITS-DECO, a generative model for Earth Observation data that leverages a unified-sequence framework inspired by large language models. SITS-DECO, with a simple decoder-only architecture, demonstrates competence in tasks such as crop-type classification without the need for task-specific adaptation. Through symbolic prompting, the model can perform various supervised and self-supervised tasks within a single architecture, showcasing its versatility. Despite its simplicity, SITS-DECO outperforms larger EO models in crop-type classification, emphasizing the significance of dense temporal sequence modeling. This work highlights a data-centric approach where model capability stems from the richness and structure of training data rather than complex architecture. SITS-DECO paves the way for lightweight, multi-modal, multi-task EO modeling and sets a foundation for future generative EO models. 
<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.21813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks. However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models, where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future generative EO foundation models.

<div> LVLM, Gestura, free-form gesture, Landmark Processing Module, CoT reasoning strategy
Summary:
Gestura is introduced as an end-to-end system for understanding free-form gestures. It utilizes a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align dynamic gesture patterns with semantic concepts. A Landmark Processing Module is incorporated to enhance fine-grained hand movement capture. The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy improves semantic inference and interpretation of unconventional gestures. These components enable robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, an open-source dataset with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs is developed for free-form gesture intention reasoning and understanding. <div>
arXiv:2510.21814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images. Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair), appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia, moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model evaluation.

Summary:<br />
This research introduces a wavelet-based detection method to differentiate between images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and real ones. By utilizing discrete wavelet transform (DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer, the method effectively identifies subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Compared to a model trained on spatial data, the wavelet-based models using Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters achieved higher accuracy rates of 93.8 percent and 95.1 percent, respectively.

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations, which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8 percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints." The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

Deep Learning (DL) has great potential in medical imaging diagnostics, but lack of interpretability hinders clinical trust. A new framework utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet50 and DenseNet121) for brain tumor and pneumonia detection in MRI and chest X-ray images respectively achieved high accuracy. DenseNet121 outperformed ResNet50 for both conditions. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated for explainability, showing DenseNet121 focused on core pathological regions while ResNet50 sometimes scattered attention.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121. These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising 7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with 94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs. 84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121 consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable, interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel method to enhance the accuracy of chromosome classification, particularly in low-cost systems and low-quality image settings where high-quality training data may be lacking. By utilizing reliability thresholding metrics and engineered features, the proposed method significantly improves the precision of chromosome classification, achieving over 90% accuracy for chromosomes with common defects and translocations. The approach involves a deep learning model combined with SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and cascade pipelines for automated filtering of semi-straight chromosomes. Comparative analysis of the thresholding metrics determines the most effective one for accurate classification. The results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in improving classification accuracy even with low-quality G-banding databases, making it a valuable tool for karyotyping facilities in resource-constrained environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially. However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget pathological laboratories.

The STAR-64K dataset, containing 64K high-quality instruction samples, was created for experimentation.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability, and scalability.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework for multimodal medical data-based survival analysis, specifically addressing the issue of incomplete modality in real-world datasets. By combining a low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model, the proposed method aims to improve the robustness and reliability of modality reconstruction. The approach formulates the problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using whole slide images and genomic profiles, incorporating a class-specific flow for cross-modal distribution alignment. By leveraging the reversible structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow model, the framework effectively constructs a distribution-consistent latent space of the missing modality. Additionally, a lightweight Transformer architecture is designed to model intra-modal dependencies while mitigating overfitting in high-dimensional modality fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in complete modality settings and maintains robust accuracy in scenarios with incomplete modalities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete modalities scenario.

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3) a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs, ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical practice.

<div> PhysicsIQ Challenge, Perception Test Workshop, ICCV 2025, video generative models, physics understanding

Summary:
The report discusses the winning entry of the PhysicsIQ Challenge presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025. It highlights the limitations of current video generative models in understanding physics and producing plausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark emphasizes that visual realism does not equate to physics understanding. The study explores the potential of leveraging SSL-based video world models to enhance the physics plausibility of video generative models. By incorporating the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) into the MAGI-1 model, the researchers demonstrate a 6% improvement in physics plausibility. This approach suggests that SSL pretraining on natural videos can help in building intuitive physics understanding in video generative models. <div>

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025. State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet, intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process. We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated, multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds, RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by +0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 / +2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs, improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

<div> modal aphasia, multimodal models, visual concepts, writing difficulties, AI safety vulnerabilities
Summary:<br /><br />
The article discusses modal aphasia, a phenomenon where current multimodal models can accurately memorize visual concepts but struggle to articulate them in writing. Despite being trained on both images and text, these models exhibit a systematic dissociation. The study shows that leading models can reproduce movie artwork perfectly visually but falter when asked for textual descriptions. Controlled experiments on synthetic datasets across various architectures confirm the emergence of modal aphasia as an inherent characteristic of these models. This poses risks in AI safety frameworks, as protective measures applied to one modality may not cover harmful concepts in others. An example demonstrates how a text-aligned model can still generate unsafe images, highlighting the importance of addressing modal aphasia in current multimodal AI models. <div>

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks, as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions. To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference. Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Summary:
PFCM is a consistency-style model based on PFGM++ that has been successful in image generation and CT image denoising, but can only be trained through distillation. This study introduces PFCT, a method to train PFCM independently. By leveraging perturbation kernels, sinusoidal discretization schedule, and Beta noise distribution, PFCT improves sample quality and adaptability. Tested on low dose CT image denoising, PFCT demonstrated enhanced image quality in terms of LPIPS and SSIM, comparable to models like the Consistency Model. PFCT showcases its potential for generative modeling tasks with competitive results and offers more flexibility in model creation. Further research is needed to optimize PFCT and explore its applicability in diverse generative modeling scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT). The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

Summary: 
This paper presents a three-stage hybrid framework for automated interpretation of complex multi-view engineering drawings using modern detection and vision language models (VLMs). The framework includes layout segmentation, fine-grained detection of annotations, and semantic content parsing using OCR-free VLMs. Specialized datasets were developed for training and testing purposes. The Alphabetical VLM achieved a strong performance in extracting textual and categorical information, while the Numerical VLM excelled in interpreting quantitative data. The unified JSON output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases, providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis. This approach addresses the challenges of interpreting varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content in engineering drawings, offering potential benefits for manufacturing communication and production details. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware, fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&amp;T symbols, and surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&amp;T frames, and surface roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of 0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases, providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

Summary:
LSF-Animation is a novel framework for speech-driven 3D facial animation that eliminates the need for explicit emotion and identity feature representations. By extracting emotion information from speech and capturing identity features from a neutral facial mesh, the model improves generalization to unseen speakers and emotional states without requiring manual labels. The Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB) integrates emotional, motion-related, and identity-related cues through a fusion token, enhancing animation realism. Extensive experiments on the 3DMEAD dataset show that LSF-Animation outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in emotional expressiveness, identity generalization, and animation quality. The source code for LSF-Animation will be available on GitHub. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans. While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional, motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at: https://github.com/Dogter521/LSF-Animation.

Summary: 
The article introduces WM-MoE, a world model-based motion forecasting framework designed to address challenges in high-risk corner-case scenarios for autonomous vehicles (AVs). By unifying perception, temporal memory, and decision-making, WM-MoE constructs a scene representation to explain observations, anticipate future dynamics, and evaluate potential actions. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a lightweight temporal tokenizer enhances long-horizon reasoning by incorporating agent trajectories and contextual cues. The use of a mixture-of-experts (MoE) decomposes complex corner cases into subproblems and allocates capacity across scenario types, with specialized experts inferring agent intent through counterfactual rollouts. The introduction of the nuScenes-corner benchmark allows for rigorous evaluation, showing that WM-MoE outperforms existing baselines on various datasets and remains robust under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in fully autonomous vehicles. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.21867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics, and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban forests.

Summary: 
TernaryCLIP is a lightweight computational framework that converts the connection weights of vision and text encoders of CLIP into ternary format, allowing for low-cost and high-efficiency computations. The framework utilizes quantization-aware training and distillation modules to maintain precision and enable extreme quantization. TernaryCLIP achieves up to 99% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, resulting in significant compression, inference acceleration, storage reduction, memory optimization, and sparsity. Despite the extreme quantization, TernaryCLIP maintains promising performance on zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval tasks across multiple datasets. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying large multimodal models efficiently on resource-constrained devices. The model and code are available on Hugging Face and GitHub.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones. TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules, preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98 $\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$ storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models, supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices. The model and code can be accessed from Hugging Face and GitHub.

<br />
Summary:
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) offer high generative performance but training costs increase quadratically with sequence length. SPRINT, a method introduced in this study, allows for aggressive token dropping of up to 75% while maintaining quality by leveraging the roles of shallow and deep layers. The model undergoes a two-stage training process: masked pre-training for efficiency and full-token fine-tuning for quality. On ImageNet-1K 256x256 dataset, SPRINT achieves a 9.8x training savings with comparable FID/FDD scores. At inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG) reduces FLOPs by nearly half while improving quality. SPRINT is deemed a simple, effective solution for efficient DiT training, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing training costs while maintaining model performance. <div>
arXiv:2510.21986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost, yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG) nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting, even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia, (2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

<title>FlowOpt: Fast Optimization Through Whole Flow Processes for Training-Free Editing</title>

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks. Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process. As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free) optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box, enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size. We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.

Abstract: Sign languages play a crucial role in the communication of deaf communities, but they are often marginalized, limiting access to essential services such as healthcare and education. This study proposes an automatic sign language recognition system based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, using Mediapipe for gesture keypoint extraction. Developed with Python, TensorFlow and Streamlit, the system provides real-time gesture translation. The results show an average accuracy of 92\%, with very good performance for distinct gestures such as ``Hello'' and ``Thank you''. However, some confusions remain for visually similar gestures, such as ``Call'' and ``Yes''. This work opens up interesting perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare, education and public services.

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning (ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly towards developing robust ML models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic, model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly available decks from Zenodo (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

<title>Human-Centric Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos Using YOLO-World and Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World - an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking. Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials, with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages - demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

<title>Capturing Gaze Shifts for Guidance: Cross-Modal Fusion Enhancement for VLM Hallucination Mitigation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22067</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores. However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding, while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational overhead.

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets, including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to 0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall, our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

<title>Mitigating Coordinate Prediction Bias from Positional Encoding Failures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

<title>Discovering Latent Graphs with GFlowNets for Diverse Conditional Image Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition, leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images. Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from 2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work. % or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data, models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6 question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\% on BDD and 37.9\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all questions types, achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as BLINK.

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors, capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven approach.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight, we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling - assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses. Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence, arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of behavior, intent, and interaction.

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences. While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects (e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs). To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning (LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics while retaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network (ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories, which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation. While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling, I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical plausibility compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions, aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA, VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and 6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for VLMs.

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple, compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping. Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

<title>TrajGATFormer: A Graph-Based Transformer Approach for Worker and Obstacle Trajectory Prediction in Off-site Construction Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22205</link>

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns, they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions. TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3 m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m). Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless, existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces, allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce 4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786 animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound while using only 1% of the target annotations.

<title>Enpowering Your Pansharpening Models with Generalizability: Unified Distribution is All You Need</title>

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data, lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN). Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across diverse satellite sensors.

Abstract: Depression, as a typical mental disorder, has become a prevalent issue significantly impacting public health. However, the prevention and treatment of depression still face multiple challenges, including complex diagnostic procedures, ambiguous criteria, and low consultation rates, which severely hinder timely assessment and intervention. To address these issues, this study adopts voice as a physiological signal and leverages its frequency-time dual domain multimodal characteristics along with deep learning models to develop an intelligent assessment and diagnostic algorithm for depression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance in the classification task for depression diagnosis, offering new insights and approaches for the assessment, screening, and diagnosis of depression.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline. Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation. This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at https://github.com/jn-kim/two-stage-edald.

<title>DiffusionLane: Diffusion Model for Lane Detection</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection, called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly, we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors. Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane, Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18 surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets 81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and 97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second (FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. The code for this project is publicly available at https://github.com/STAmirr/ cgra4ml_semantic_segmentation

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However, these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS) Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available at: \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/stone96123/GSAlign}.

Abstract: Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our dataset construction pipeline employs various techniques, including filtering and deduplication, which have been shown to be effective in previous studies. To evaluate its effectiveness, we also construct WAON-Bench, a manually curated benchmark for Japanese cultural image classification, consisting of 374 classes. To assess the effectiveness of our dataset, we conduct experiments using both WAON and the Japanese subset of ReLAION, one of the most widely used vision-language datasets. We fine-tune SigLIP2, a strong multilingual model, on both datasets. The results demonstrate that WAON enhances model performance on WAON-Bench more efficiently than ReLAION and achieves higher accuracy across all evaluated benchmarks. Furthermore, the model fine-tuned on WAON achieves state-of-the-art performance on several Japanese cultural benchmarks. We release our dataset, model, and code at https://speed1313.github.io/WAON.

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem. However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce \textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban \textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines, improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators. This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

<title>GRPO-Guard: Mitigating Implicit Over-Optimization in Flow Matching via Regulated Clipping</title>

arXiv:2510.22319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions, preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g., SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving generation quality.

<title>Beyond Augmentation: Leveraging Inter-Instance Relation in Self-Supervised Representation Learning</title>

arXiv:2510.22322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances. Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/alijavidani/SSL-GraphNNCLR.

Recent diffusion-based methods typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \& product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately in image space. Traditional 3D editing approaches are time-consuming and demand specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy in geometric conditioning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric conditioning of 3D features in image generation. GeoDiffusion employs a class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various iterative design workflows.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.

<title>T2SMark: Balancing Robustness and Diversity in Noise-as-Watermark for Diffusion Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22366</link>

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/0xD009/T2SMark}{https://github.com/0xD009/T2SMark}.

<title>Efficient Large-Deformation Medical Image Registration via Recurrent Dynamic Correlation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22380</link>

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime, efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task. Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off, surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative high-performing method.

Abstract: We present a fully interpretable and flexible statistical method for background subtraction in roadside LiDAR data, aimed at enhancing infrastructure-based perception in automated driving. Our approach introduces both a Gaussian distribution grid (GDG), which models the spatial statistics of the background using background-only scans, and a filtering algorithm that uses this representation to classify LiDAR points as foreground or background. The method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and adapts to various configurations. Evaluated on the publicly available RCooper dataset, it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and flexibility, even with minimal background data. Its efficient implementation ensures reliable performance on low-resource hardware, enabling scalable real-world deployment.

<title>Top-Down Semantic Refinement for Image Captioning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22391</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR), which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization, and hallucination suppression.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems. Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under varying levels of snowfall

<title>Benchmarking Egocentric Multimodal Goal Inference for Assistive Wearable Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29 hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings, featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with 84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant modalities.

arXiv:2510.22454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging (SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view, leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

<title>Single-Teacher View Augmentation: Boosting Knowledge Distillation via Angular Diversity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22480</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss, which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover, the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be found at https://github.com/YangGaoUQ/GateFuseNet

arXiv:2510.22521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional, and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines, highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

<title>Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG): A Robust and Efficient Loop Closure Detection Method Under Perceptual Aliasing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency. However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments, such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the Bicocca25b dataset.

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning, coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution (SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in super-resolution.

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects, such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states (e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in VLM research.

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization capabilities on existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However, learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions. First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>Cross-View UAV Geo-Localization with Precision-Focused Efficient Design: A Hierarchical Distillation Approach with Multi-view Refinement</title>

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design (PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3 \times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for real-time UAV applications. The project is available at https://github.com/SkyEyeLoc/PFED

<title>PSScreen V2: Partially Supervised Multiple Retinal Disease Screening</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions, addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end, PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout), which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets, highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/boyiZheng99/PSScreen_V2.

<title>Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge for CT Reconstruction from Incomplete Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22605</link>

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work, we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score. In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and domain-shift evaluations.

<title>SWAN: Self-supervised Wavelet Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Unmixing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22607</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse, distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative, quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact network parameters for practical applications.

<title>Cross-Species Transfer Learning in Agricultural AI: Evaluating ZebraPose Adaptation for Dairy Cattle Pose Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock, especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations - a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments. While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87, PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures are important biomarkers of tumor aggressiveness in histopathology, yet reliable recognition remains challenging due to severe class imbalance and variability across imaging domains. We present a DenseNet-121-based framework tailored for atypical mitosis classification in the MIDOG 2025 (Track 2) setting. Our method integrates stain-aware augmentation (Macenko), geometric and intensity transformations, and imbalance-aware learning via weighted sampling with a hybrid objective combining class-weighted binary cross-entropy and focal loss. Trained end-to-end with AdamW and evaluated across multiple independent domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts, achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency. We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The code and datasets will be released soon.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features. Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs) are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components. First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components: Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof), or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban planning, and disaster preparedness.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks, including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation. The dataset and source code of this project will be publicly available soon.

<title>VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos. Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics, encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset (fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks. The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters, achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a 3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data curation pipeline.

Abstract: Lipreading has emerged as an increasingly important research area for developing robust speech recognition systems and assistive technologies for the hearing-impaired. However, non-English resources for visual speech recognition remain limited. We introduce LRW-Persian, the largest in-the-wild Persian word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over $414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource, LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional and dialectal coverage, and rich per-clip metadata including head pose, age, and gender. To ensure large-scale data quality, we establish a fully automated end-to-end curation pipeline encompassing transcription based on Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a critical gap in low-resource languages, LRW-Persian enables rigorous benchmarking, supports cross-lingual transfer, and provides a foundation for advancing multimodal speech research in underrepresented linguistic contexts. The dataset is publicly available at: https://lrw-persian.vercel.app.

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution, and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding. Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis, reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising directions for future research.

<title>ConMatFormer: A Multi-attention and Transformer Integrated ConvNext based Deep Learning Model for Enhanced Diabetic Foot Ulcer Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22743</link>

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities. Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy, reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by 4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical image analysis.

<title>Self-Calibrated Consistency can Fight Back for Adversarial Robustness in Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22785</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone, medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5 diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical readiness.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency, identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation. To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation. MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames. Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy, offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

<title>FairJudge: MLLM Judging for Social Attributes and Prompt Image Alignment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues, lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1]; constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions; unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions. We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes. Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability: Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025 workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

arXiv:2510.22838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR), a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD) for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning, visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency across diverse visual styles.

<title>FastJAM: a Fast Joint Alignment Model for Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss, that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality, while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

<title>Semantic Surgery: Zero-Shot Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

<title>Seeing the Unseen: Towards Zero-Shot Inspection for Wind Turbine Blades using Knowledge-Augmented Vision Language Models</title>

arXiv:2510.22868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance. Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed, comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting. Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm * 30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors (AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual, spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in a Kaggle competition that challenges the international Machine Learning community with the task of pasture biomass estimation. The dataset is available on the official Kaggle webpage: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/csiro-biomass

<title>Gen-LangSplat: Generalized Language Gaussian Splatting with Pre-Trained Feature Compression</title>

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments. State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat, that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive 3D AI applications.

arXiv:2510.22936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding (\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM reasoning.

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend this work to other biometrics in the future.

<title>Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization For Face Image Compression</title>

arXiv:2510.22943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes, such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

<title>LightBagel: A Light-weighted, Double Fusion Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and (2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME} for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings. Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing VE baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks. Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping, agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

<title>VALA: Learning Latent Anchors for Training-Free and Temporally Consistent</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22970</link>

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments, VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective. Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over prior methods.

<title>Scaling Up Occupancy-centric Driving Scene Generation: Dataset and Method</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving, enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation. Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark. Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation, and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases, and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images. While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and (ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a ``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator, highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films, and games.

<title>LoMix: Learnable Weighted Multi-Scale Logits Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22995</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22995</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final, highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations. Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication, concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales, mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures (i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency. Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/SLDGroup/LoMix.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for $\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation, enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video. CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second, in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video generation.

<title>UGAE: Unified Geometry and Attribute Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Point Clouds</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23009</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23009</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs; however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement (PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions. UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets: 8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29), UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with 56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it improved perceptual quality significantly.

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale, multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark. Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.}

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide a robust foundation for future research.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However, their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model, which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP) blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long, untrimmed videos.

Abstract: Deep learning based deformable registration methods have become popular in recent years. However, their ability to generalize beyond training data distribution can be poor, significantly hindering their usability. LUMIR brain registration challenge for Learn2Reg 2025 aims to advance the field by evaluating the performance of the registration on contrasts and modalities different from those included in the training set. Here we describe our submission to the challenge, which proposes a very simple idea for significantly improving robustness by transforming the images into MIND feature space before feeding them into the model. In addition, a special ensembling strategy is proposed that shows a small but consistent improvement.

arXiv:2510.23087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most 3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing 3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the 3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal understanding. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/JJJYmmm/Multimodal-RoPEs.

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides, they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/RDBM.

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and weights will be released under a permissive license.

<title>DeepSalt: Bridging Laboratory and Satellite Spectra through Domain Adaptation and Knowledge Distillation for Large-Scale Soil Salinity Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23124</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so, reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks. DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of the salinity variance.

<title>Note on the Construction of Structure Tensor</title>

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares (TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which, although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion, provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

Abstract: Tracer kinetic modeling serves a vital role in diagnosis, treatment planning, tracer development and oncology, but burdens practitioners with complex and invasive arterial input function estimation (AIF). We adopt a physics-informed CycleGAN showing promise in DCE-MRI quantification to dynamic PET quantification.

<title>DQ3D: Depth-guided Query for Transformer-Based 3D Object Detection in Traffic Scenarios</title>

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects. However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection (DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object. Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\% in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection Score (NDS).

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work, we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in 3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism. Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in complex industrial scenes.

<title>Finding 3D Scene Analogies with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies. In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from 3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in trajectory and waypoint transfer.

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating VLMs is publicly available at: https://github.com/pascalbenschopTU/VLLM_AnomalyRecognition

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders, class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii) halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at https://github.com/DavidePasero/deco/tree/main.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints, enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

<title>Accurate and Scalable Multimodal Pathology Retrieval via Attentive Vision-Language Alignment</title>

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1) mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination, and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence, and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF, DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake, referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques. Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods, intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

<title>Autoregressive Styled Text Image Generation, but Make it Reliable</title>

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing. A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones. Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the textual prompt, improving content adherence.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably, across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering (VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors.

arXiv:2510.23278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes. Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often overlook.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom.

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions. Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0 and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors (e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components: modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of 9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios, respectively.

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both global structure and local details.Project page: https://jiahao620.github.io/reconviagen.

Abstract: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis: the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations, presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep learning in medical imaging.
  Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain adaptation.

Abstract: Medical image analysis is central to drug discovery and preclinical evaluation, where scalable, objective readouts can accelerate decision-making. We address classification of paclitaxel (Taxol) exposure from phase-contrast microscopy of C6 glioma cells -- a task with subtle dose differences that challenges full-image models. We propose a simple tiling-and-aggregation pipeline that operates on local patches and combines tile outputs into an image label, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset and improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance model interpretability and point toward robustness-oriented directions for future medical image research. Code is released to facilitate reproduction and extension.

<title>PlanarTrack: A high-quality and challenging benchmark for large-scale planar object tracking</title>

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short- and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations, each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at https://github.com/HengLan/PlanarTrack

<title>An Efficient Remote Sensing Super Resolution Method Exploring Diffusion Priors and Multi-Modal Constraints for Crop Type Mapping</title>

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models, especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB) and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution, yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1: 0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision agriculture.

<title>VideoTG-R1: Boosting Video Temporal Grounding via Curriculum Reinforcement Learning on Reflected Boundary Annotations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23397</link>

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples. (1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically, we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at https://github.com/ldong1111/VideoTG-R1.

arXiv:2510.23414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples, enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and innovation in point cloud learning.

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms. It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

<title>Quality-controlled registration of urban MLS point clouds reducing drift effects by adaptive fragmentation</title>

arXiv:2510.23416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic city monitoring.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up, geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs, and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details. Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling: sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task. Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the reconstruction process.

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques, leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However, the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples, enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50. Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%, 80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain \textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and +2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker, which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability. Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions, they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable, limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments. Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12 infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection environment.

arXiv:2510.23479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality. To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency, surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in classification and MLLMs.

<title>On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention, indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

<title>Yesnt: Are Diffusion Relighting Models Ready for Capture Stage Compositing? A Hybrid Alternative to Bridge the Gap</title>

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric video relighting.

arXiv:2510.23497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages, including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac, exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods. Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification, particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships among visual entities.

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs, no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks.

<title>DPGLA: Bridging the Gap between Synthetic and Real Data for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However, we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M, a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at https://github.com/InternRobotics/EgoThinker.

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic degra- dation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation, starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a play- and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters. Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and im- prove the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves state-of- the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The code will be made available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/MERGE

<title>Lookahead Anchoring: Preserving Character Identity in Audio-Driven Human Animation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization, identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal conditioning across several different architectures.

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive (AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from 386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics. To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics.

arXiv:2510.23594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism, efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE (Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation. It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified. Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed, such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with 2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation, in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7% mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Accurate monitoring of pest population dynamics is crucial for informed decision-making in precision agriculture. Currently, mainstream image-based pest counting methods primarily rely on image processing combined with machine learning or deep learning for pest counting. However, these methods have limitations and struggle to handle situations involving pest occlusion. To address this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with trajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting in water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest counting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the distribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded individuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the impact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and selected the optimal trajectory for pest counting. Specifically, we designed six representative stirring trajectories, including circle, square, triangle, spiral, four small circles, and random lines, for the robotic arm to stir. And by comparing the overall average counting error and counting confidence of different stirring trajectories across various pest density scenarios, we determined the optimal trajectory. Finally, we proposed a counting confidence-driven closed-loop control system to achieve adaptive-speed stirring. It uses changes in pest counting confidence between consecutive frames as feedback to adjust the stirring speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to investigating the effects of different stirring trajectories on object counting in the dynamic liquid environment and to implement adaptive-speed stirring for this type of task. Experimental results show ...

Abstract: We introduce J-ORA, a novel multimodal dataset that bridges the gap in robot perception by providing detailed object attribute annotations within Japanese human-robot dialogue scenarios. J-ORA is designed to support three critical perception tasks, object identification, reference resolution, and next-action prediction, by leveraging a comprehensive template of attributes (e.g., category, color, shape, size, material, and spatial relations). Extensive evaluations with both proprietary and open-source Vision Language Models (VLMs) reveal that incorporating detailed object attributes substantially improves multimodal perception performance compared to without object attributes. Despite the improvement, we find that there still exists a gap between proprietary and open-source VLMs. In addition, our analysis of object affordances demonstrates varying abilities in understanding object functionality and contextual relationships across different VLMs. These findings underscore the importance of rich, context-sensitive attribute annotations in advancing robot perception in dynamic environments.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging aims to reproduce the wide range of brightness levels present in natural scenes, which the human visual system can perceive but conventional digital cameras often fail to capture due to their limited dynamic range. To address this limitation, we propose a deep learning-based multi-exposure fusion approach for HDR image generation. The method takes a set of differently exposed Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images, typically an underexposed and an overexposed image, and learns to fuse their complementary information using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The underexposed image preserves details in bright regions, while the overexposed image retains information in dark regions; the network effectively combines these to reconstruct a high-quality HDR output. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner, without relying on ground-truth HDR images, making it practical for real-world applications where such data is unavailable. We evaluate our results using the Multi-Exposure Fusion Structural Similarity Index Measure (MEF-SSIM) and demonstrate that our approach achieves superior visual quality compared to existing fusion methods. A customized loss function is further introduced to improve reconstruction fidelity and optimize model performance.

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image. The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture. First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second, introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification, with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from 12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L score.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms generally depends on data representation. That is why, much of the current effort in performing machine learning algorithms goes into the design of preprocessing frameworks and data transformations able to support effective machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods. The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to outperform competing methods in most cases.

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels, MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains, with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims at improving the perception or interpretability of an image captured in an environment with poor illumination. With the advent of deep learning, the LLIE technique has achieved significant breakthroughs. However, existing LLIE methods either ignore the important role of frequency domain information or fail to effectively promote the propagation and flow of information, limiting the LLIE performance. In this paper, we develop a novel frequency-spatial interaction-driven network (FSIDNet) for LLIE based on two-stage architecture. To be specific, the first stage is designed to restore the amplitude of low-light images to improve the lightness, and the second stage devotes to restore phase information to refine fine-grained structures. Considering that Frequency domain and spatial domain information are complementary and both favorable for LLIE, we further develop two frequency-spatial interaction blocks which mutually amalgamate the complementary spatial and frequency information to enhance the capability of the model. In addition, we construct the Information Exchange Module (IEM) to associate two stages by adequately incorporating cross-stage and cross-scale features to effectively promote the propagation and flow of information in the two-stage network structure. Finally, we conduct experiments on several widely used benchmark datasets (i.e., LOL-Real, LSRW-Huawei, etc.), which demonstrate that our method achieves the excellent performance in terms of visual results and quantitative metrics while preserving good model efficiency.

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for interpretable sentiment analysis. Ultimately, this work establishes the first benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, thus contributing a valuable resource to the broader advancement of multilingual NLP and explainable AI.

Abstract: Self-balancing exoskeletons offer a promising mobility solution for individuals with lower-limb disabilities. For reliable long-term operation, these exoskeletons require a perception system that is effective in changing environments. In this work, we introduce LT-Exosense, a vision-centric, multi-session mapping system designed to support long-term (semi)-autonomous navigation for exoskeleton users. LT-Exosense extends single-session mapping capabilities by incrementally fusing spatial knowledge across multiple sessions, detecting environmental changes, and updating a persistent global map. This representation enables intelligent path planning, which can adapt to newly observed obstacles and can recover previous routes when obstructions are removed. We validate LT-Exosense through several real-world experiments, demonstrating a scalable multi-session map that achieves an average point-to-point error below 5 cm when compared to ground-truth laser scans. We also illustrate the potential application of adaptive path planning in dynamically changing indoor environments.

Abstract: Machine learning in neurosurgery is limited by challenges in assembling large, high-quality imaging datasets. Synthetic data offers a scalable, privacy-preserving solution. We evaluated the feasibility of generating realistic lateral cervical spine radiographs using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) trained on 4,963 images from the Cervical Spine X-ray Atlas. Model performance was monitored via training/validation loss and Frechet inception distance, and synthetic image quality was assessed in a blinded "clinical Turing test" with six neuroradiologists and two spine-fellowship trained neurosurgeons. Experts reviewed 50 quartets containing one real and three synthetic images, identifying the real image and rating realism on a 4-point Likert scale. Experts correctly identified the real image in 29% of trials (Fleiss' kappa=0.061). Mean realism scores were comparable between real (3.323) and synthetic images (3.228, 3.258, and 3.320; p=0.383, 0.471, 1.000). Nearest-neighbor analysis found no evidence of memorization. We also provide a dataset of 20,063 synthetic radiographs. These results demonstrate that DDPM-generated cervical spine X-rays are statistically indistinguishable in realism and quality from real clinical images, offering a novel approach to creating large-scale neuroimaging datasets for ML applications in landmarking, segmentation, and classification.

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape, offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for all model participants.

<title>Hybrid-Vector Retrieval for Visually Rich Documents: Combining Single-Vector Efficiency and Multi-Vector Accuracy</title>

Abstract: Retrieval over visually rich documents is essential for tasks such as legal discovery, scientific search, and enterprise knowledge management. Existing approaches fall into two paradigms: single-vector retrieval, which is efficient but coarse, and multi-vector retrieval, which is accurate but computationally expensive. To address this trade-off, we propose HEAVEN, a two-stage hybrid-vector framework. In the first stage, HEAVEN efficiently retrieves candidate pages using a single-vector method over Visually-Summarized Pages (VS-Pages), which assemble representative visual layouts from multiple pages. In the second stage, it reranks candidates with a multi-vector method while filtering query tokens by linguistic importance to reduce redundant computations. To evaluate retrieval systems under realistic conditions, we also introduce ViMDOC, the first benchmark for visually rich, multi-document, and long-document retrieval. Across four benchmarks, HEAVEN attains 99.87% of the Recall@1 performance of multi-vector models on average while reducing per-query computation by 99.82%, achieving efficiency and accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/juyeonnn/HEAVEN

Abstract: Using risky text prompts, such as pornography and violent prompts, to test the safety of text-to-image (T2I) models is a critical task. However, existing risky prompt datasets are limited in three key areas: 1) limited risky categories, 2) coarse-grained annotation, and 3) low effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce T2I-RiskyPrompt, a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating safety-related tasks in T2I models. Specifically, we first develop a hierarchical risk taxonomy, which consists of 6 primary categories and 14 fine-grained subcategories. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct a pipeline to collect and annotate risky prompts. Finally, we obtain 6,432 effective risky prompts, where each prompt is annotated with both hierarchical category labels and detailed risk reasons. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation, we propose a reason-driven risky image detection method that explicitly aligns the MLLM with safety annotations. Based on T2I-RiskyPrompt, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight T2I models, nine defense methods, five safety filters, and five attack strategies, offering nine key insights into the strengths and limitations of T2I model safety. Finally, we discuss potential applications of T2I-RiskyPrompt across various research fields. The dataset and code are provided in https://github.com/datar001/T2I-RiskyPrompt.

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization, and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances. Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at \href{https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/DynaSolidGeo/}{DynaSolidGeo}.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining-driven Fused State Representation in Proximal Policy Optimization (BLIP-FusePPO), a novel multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) framework for autonomous lane-keeping (LK), in which semantic embeddings generated by a vision-language model (VLM) are directly fused with geometric states, LiDAR observations, and Proportional-Integral-Derivative-based (PID) control feedback within the agent observation space. The proposed method lets the agent learn driving rules that are aware of their surroundings and easy to understand by combining high-level scene understanding from the VLM with low-level control and spatial signals. Our architecture brings together semantic, geometric, and control-aware representations to make policy learning more robust. A hybrid reward function that includes semantic alignment, LK accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed regulation helps learning to be more efficient and generalizable. Our method is different from the approaches that only use semantic models to shape rewards. Instead, it directly embeds semantic features into the state representation. This cuts down on expensive runtime inference and makes sure that semantic guidance is always available. The simulation results show that the proposed model is better at LK stability and adaptability than the best vision-based and multimodal RL baselines in a wide range of difficult driving situations. We make our code publicly available.

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics. Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios, covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across 32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a 19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a 58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/HKUSTDial/VisJudgeBench.

Abstract: Image-to-image translation models have achieved notable success in converting images across visual domains and are increasingly used for medical tasks such as predicting post-operative outcomes and modeling disease progression. However, most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated images. This limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and hallucinations, undermining the reliability and interpretability of the predictions. These challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy. In this work, we present TraceTrans, a novel deformable image translation model designed for post-operative prediction that generates images aligned with the target distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the pre-operative input. The framework employs an encoder for feature extraction and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the translated image. The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints on the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source. Extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate that TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions, highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.

<title>Dynamic Dropout: Leveraging Conway's Game of Life for Neural Networks Regularization</title>

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different dropout techniques.

Abstract: Deep neural networks can convert ECG page images into analyzable waveforms, yet centralized training often conflicts with cross-institutional privacy and deployment constraints. A cross-silo federated digitization framework is presented that trains a full-model nnU-Net segmentation backbone without sharing images and aggregates updates across sites under realistic non-IID heterogeneity (layout, grid style, scanner profile, noise).
  The protocol integrates three standard server-side aggregators--FedAvg, FedProx, and FedAdam--and couples secure aggregation with central, user-level differential privacy to align utility with formal guarantees. Key features include: (i) end-to-end full-model training and synchronization across clients; (ii) secure aggregation so the server only observes a clipped, weighted sum once a participation threshold is met; (iii) central Gaussian DP with Renyi accounting applied post-aggregation for auditable user-level privacy; and (iv) a calibration-aware digitization pipeline comprising page normalization, trace segmentation, grid-leakage suppression, and vectorization to twelve-lead signals.
  Experiments on ECG pages rendered from PTB-XL show consistently faster convergence and higher late-round plateaus with adaptive server updates (FedAdam) relative to FedAvg and FedProx, while approaching centralized performance. The privacy mechanism maintains competitive accuracy while preventing exposure of raw images or per-client updates, yielding deployable, auditable guarantees suitable for multi-institution settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing creative task performance, such as long video generation. This study introduces three innovations to improve multi-agent collaboration. First, we propose OmniAgent, a hierarchical, graph-based multi-agent framework for long video generation that leverages a film-production-inspired architecture to enable modular specialization and scalable inter-agent collaboration. Second, inspired by context engineering, we propose hypergraph nodes that enable temporary group discussions among agents lacking sufficient context, reducing individual memory requirements while ensuring adequate contextual information. Third, we transition from directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to directed cyclic graphs with limited retries, allowing agents to reflect and refine outputs iteratively, thereby improving earlier stages through feedback from subsequent nodes. These contributions lay the groundwork for developing more robust multi-agent systems in creative tasks.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF) decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100 samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable, data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset generation, and performance-driven optimization.

Abstract: Exposure-agnostic video frame interpolation (VFI) is a challenging task that aims to recover sharp, high-frame-rate videos from blurry, low-frame-rate inputs captured under unknown and dynamic exposure conditions. Event cameras are sensors with high temporal resolution, making them especially advantageous for this task. However, existing event-guided methods struggle to produce satisfactory results on severely low-frame-rate blurry videos due to the lack of temporal constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel event-guided framework for exposure-agnostic VFI, addressing this limitation through two key components: a Target-adaptive Event Sampling (TES) and a Target-adaptive Importance Mapping (TIM). Specifically, TES samples events around the target timestamp and the unknown exposure time to better align them with the corresponding blurry frames. TIM then generates an importance map that considers the temporal proximity and spatial relevance of consecutive features to the target. Guided by this map, our framework adaptively blends consecutive features, allowing temporally aligned features to serve as the primary cues while spatially relevant ones offer complementary support. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in exposure-agnostic VFI scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced auditory speech recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR), and audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR). However, understanding of their internal dynamics under fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through a detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token, thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling rates.

Abstract: The misuse of advanced generative AI models has resulted in the widespread proliferation of falsified data, particularly forged human-centric audiovisual content, which poses substantial societal risks (e.g., financial fraud and social instability). In response to this growing threat, several works have preliminarily explored countermeasures. However, the lack of sufficient and diverse training data, along with the absence of a standardized benchmark, hinder deeper exploration. To address this challenge, we first build Mega-MMDF, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset for multimodal deepfake detection. Specifically, we employ 21 forgery pipelines through the combination of 10 audio forgery methods, 12 visual forgery methods, and 6 audio-driven face reenactment methods. Mega-MMDF currently contains 0.1 million real samples and 1.1 million forged samples, making it one of the largest and most diverse multimodal deepfake datasets, with plans for continuous expansion. Building on it, we present DeepfakeBench-MM, the first unified benchmark for multimodal deepfake detection. It establishes standardized protocols across the entire detection pipeline and serves as a versatile platform for evaluating existing methods as well as exploring novel approaches. DeepfakeBench-MM currently supports 5 datasets and 11 multimodal deepfake detectors. Furthermore, our comprehensive evaluations and in-depth analyses uncover several key findings from multiple perspectives (e.g., augmentation, stacked forgery). We believe that DeepfakeBench-MM, together with our large-scale Mega-MMDF, will serve as foundational infrastructures for advancing multimodal deepfake detection.

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies: (i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting (GS) struggles with degraded rendering quality on low-cost devices. To address this issue, we present edge collaborative GS (ECO-GS), where each user can switch between a local small GS model to guarantee timeliness and a remote large GS model to guarantee fidelity. However, deciding how to engage the large GS model is nontrivial, due to the interdependency between rendering requirements and resource conditions. To this end, we propose integrated rendering and communication (IRAC), which jointly optimizes collaboration status (i.e., deciding whether to engage large GS) and edge power allocation (i.e., enabling remote rendering) under communication constraints across different users by minimizing a newly-derived GS switching function. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose an efficient penalty majorization minimization (PMM) algorithm to obtain the critical point solution. Furthermore, we develop an imitation learning optimization (ILO) algorithm, which reduces the computational time by over 100x compared to PMM. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of PMM and the real-time execution capability of ILO.

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16 languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability. Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med, LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity, and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning, improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and explainable medical VLMs.

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) aims to segment instances in remote sensing images according to referring expressions. Unlike Referring Image Segmentation on general images, acquiring high-quality referring expressions in the remote sensing domain is particularly challenging due to the prevalence of small, densely distributed objects and complex backgrounds. This paper introduces a new learning paradigm, Weakly Referring Expression Learning (WREL) for RRSIS, which leverages abundant class names as weakly referring expressions together with a small set of accurate ones to enable efficient training under limited annotation conditions. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that mixed-referring training yields a provable upper bound on the performance gap relative to training with fully annotated referring expressions, thereby establishing the validity of this new setting. We also propose LRB-WREL, which integrates a Learnable Reference Bank (LRB) to refine weakly referring expressions through sample-specific prompt embeddings that enrich coarse class-name inputs. Combined with a teacher-student optimization framework using dynamically scheduled EMA updates, LRB-WREL stabilizes training and enhances cross-modal generalization under noisy weakly referring supervision. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark with varying weakly referring data ratios validate both the theoretical insights and the practical effectiveness of WREL and LRB-WREL, demonstrating that they can approach or even surpass models trained with fully annotated referring expressions.

Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) is attractive for unobtrusive and privacy-preserving monitoring, yet many CNN/RNN solutions remain too heavy for edge deployment, and even lightweight ViT/SSM variants often exceed practical compute and memory budgets. We introduce Neural-HAR, a dimension-gated CNN accelerator tailored for real-time radar HAR on resource-constrained platforms. At its core is GateCNN, a parameter-efficient Doppler-temporal network that (i) embeds Doppler vectors to emphasize frequency evolution over time and (ii) applies dual-path gated convolutions that modulate Doppler-aware content features with temporal gates, complemented by a residual path for stable training. On the University of Glasgow UoG2020 continuous radar dataset, GateCNN attains 86.4% accuracy with only 2.7k parameters and 0.28M FLOPs per inference, comparable to CNN-BiGRU at a fraction of the complexity. Our FPGA prototype on Xilinx Zynq-7000 Z-7007S reaches 107.5 $\mu$s latency and 15 mW dynamic power using LUT-based ROM and distributed RAM only (zero DSP/BRAM), demonstrating real-time, energy-efficient edge inference. Code and HLS conversion scripts are available at https://github.com/lab-emi/AIRHAR.

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues, this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction (InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable, adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method, we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler, therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation, we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial examples for the first time.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities, offering real-time, radiation-free assessment across diverse clinical domains. However, interpretation of ultrasound images remains challenging due to high noise levels, operator dependence, and limited field of view, resulting in substantial inter-observer variability. Current Deep Learning approaches are hindered by the scarcity of large labeled datasets and the domain gap between general and sonographic images, which limits the transferability of models pretrained on non-medical data. To address these challenges, we introduce the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), the first large-scale self-supervised MAE framework pretrained exclusively on ultrasound data. The model was pre-trained on 370,000 2D and 3D ultrasound images curated from 46 open-source datasets, collectively termed OpenUS-46, spanning over twenty anatomical regions. This curated dataset has been made publicly available to facilitate further research and reproducibility. Using a Vision Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, USF-MAE reconstructs masked image patches, enabling it to learn rich, modality-specific representations directly from unlabeled data. The pretrained encoder was fine-tuned on three public downstream classification benchmarks: BUS-BRA (breast cancer), MMOTU-2D (ovarian tumors), and GIST514-DB (gastrointestinal stromal tumors). Across all tasks, USF-MAE consistently outperformed conventional CNN and ViT baselines, achieving F1-scores of 81.6%, 79.6%, and 82.4%, respectively. Despite not using labels during pretraining, USF-MAE approached the performance of the supervised foundation model UltraSam on breast cancer classification and surpassed it on the other tasks, demonstrating strong cross-anatomical generalization.

Abstract: This paper introduces an intelligent water-saving irrigation system designed to address critical challenges in precision agriculture, such as inefficient water use and poor terrain adaptability. The system integrates advanced computer vision, robotic control, and real-time stabilization technologies via a multi-sensor fusion approach. A lightweight YOLO model, deployed on an embedded vision processor (K210), enables real-time plant container detection with over 96% accuracy under varying lighting conditions. A simplified hand-eye calibration algorithm-designed for 'handheld camera' robot arm configurations-ensures that the end effector can be precisely positioned, with a success rate exceeding 90%. The active leveling system, driven by the STM32F103ZET6 main control chip and JY901S inertial measurement data, can stabilize the irrigation platform on slopes up to 10 degrees, with a response time of 1.8 seconds. Experimental results across three simulated agricultural environments (standard greenhouse, hilly terrain, complex lighting) demonstrate a 30-50% reduction in water consumption compared to conventional flood irrigation, with water use efficiency exceeding 92% in all test cases.

Abstract: We present Seq-DeepIPC, a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model for legged robot navigation in realworld environments. Seq-DeepIPC advances intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas. Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we will release the codes to our GitHub repository at https://github.com/oskarnatan/Seq-DeepIPC.

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance, where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation: We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image, video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at enhancing representation quality.

Abstract: Despite their mechanical sophistication, surgical robots remain blind to their surroundings. This lack of spatial awareness causes collisions, system recoveries, and workflow disruptions, issues that will intensify with the introduction of distributed robots with independent interacting arms. Existing tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and reflective markers, providing only limited views of the surgical scene and adding hardware burden in crowded operating rooms. We present a marker-free proprioception method that enables precise localisation of surgical robots under their sterile draping despite associated obstruction of visual cues. Our method solely relies on lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning models. It builds on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset to date (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical in vivo studies). By tracking the entire robot and surgical scene, rather than individual markers, our approach provides a holistic view robust to occlusions, supporting surgical scene understanding and context-aware control. We demonstrate an example of potential clinical benefits during in vivo breathing compensation with access to tissue dynamics, unobservable under state of the art tracking, and accurately locate in multi-robot systems for future intelligent interaction. In addition, and compared with existing systems, our method eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25%. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However, progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data, a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions, visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models. Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model, trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5 languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for translating text directly from images.

Abstract: First Order Motion Model is a generative model that animates human heads based on very little motion information derived from keypoints. It is a promising solution for video communication because first it operates at very low bitrate and second its computational complexity is moderate compared to other learning based video codecs. However, it has strong limitations by design. Since it generates facial animations by warping source-images, it fails to recreate videos with strong head movements. This works concentrates on one specific kind of head movements, namely head rotations. We show that replacing the Jacobian transformations in FOMM by a global rotation helps the system to perform better on items with head-rotations while saving 40% to 80% of bitrate on P-frames. Moreover, we apply state-of-the-art normalization techniques to the discriminator to stabilize the adversarial training which is essential for generating visually appealing videos. We evaluate the performance by the learned metics LPIPS and DISTS to show the success our optimizations.

Abstract: The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments. As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify, since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts. Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup, resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's robotics landscape.

Abstract: Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills: low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban. Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world uncertainties.

Abstract: Trained generative models have shown remarkable performance as priors for inverse problems in imaging -- for example, Generative Adversarial Network priors permit recovery of test images from 5-10x fewer measurements than sparsity priors. Unfortunately, these models may be unable to represent any particular image because of architectural choices, mode collapse, and bias in the training dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that invertible neural networks, which have zero representation error by design, can be effective natural signal priors at inverse problems such as denoising, compressive sensing, and inpainting. Given a trained generative model, we study the empirical risk formulation of the desired inverse problem under a regularization that promotes high likelihood images, either directly by penalization or algorithmically by initialization. For compressive sensing, invertible priors can yield higher accuracy than sparsity priors across almost all undersampling ratios, and due to their lack of representation error, invertible priors can yield better reconstructions than GAN priors for images that have rare features of variation within the biased training set, including out-of-distribution natural images. We additionally compare performance for compressive sensing to unlearned methods, such as the deep decoder, and we establish theoretical bounds on expected recovery error in the case of a linear invertible model.

Abstract: Today's scene graph generation (SGG) task is still far from practical, mainly due to the severe training bias, e.g., collapsing diverse "human walk on / sit on / lay on beach" into "human on beach". Given such SGG, the down-stream tasks such as VQA can hardly infer better scene structures than merely a bag of objects. However, debiasing in SGG is not trivial because traditional debiasing methods cannot distinguish between the good and bad bias, e.g., good context prior (e.g., "person read book" rather than "eat") and bad long-tailed bias (e.g., "near" dominating "behind / in front of"). In this paper, we present a novel SGG framework based on causal inference but not the conventional likelihood. We first build a causal graph for SGG, and perform traditional biased training with the graph. Then, we propose to draw the counterfactual causality from the trained graph to infer the effect from the bad bias, which should be removed. In particular, we use Total Direct Effect (TDE) as the proposed final predicate score for unbiased SGG. Note that our framework is agnostic to any SGG model and thus can be widely applied in the community who seeks unbiased predictions. By using the proposed Scene Graph Diagnosis toolkit on the SGG benchmark Visual Genome and several prevailing models, we observed significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Long-Tailed Classification by Keeping the Good and Removing the Bad Momentum Causal Effect</title>

Abstract: As the class size grows, maintaining a balanced dataset across many classes is challenging because the data are long-tailed in nature; it is even impossible when the sample-of-interest co-exists with each other in one collectable unit, e.g., multiple visual instances in one image. Therefore, long-tailed classification is the key to deep learning at scale. However, existing methods are mainly based on re-weighting/re-sampling heuristics that lack a fundamental theory. In this paper, we establish a causal inference framework, which not only unravels the whys of previous methods, but also derives a new principled solution. Specifically, our theory shows that the SGD momentum is essentially a confounder in long-tailed classification. On one hand, it has a harmful causal effect that misleads the tail prediction biased towards the head. On the other hand, its induced mediation also benefits the representation learning and head prediction. Our framework elegantly disentangles the paradoxical effects of the momentum, by pursuing the direct causal effect caused by an input sample. In particular, we use causal intervention in training, and counterfactual reasoning in inference, to remove the "bad" while keep the "good". We achieve new state-of-the-arts on three long-tailed visual recognition benchmarks: Long-tailed CIFAR-10/-100, ImageNet-LT for image classification and LVIS for instance segmentation.

Abstract: In the recent years, there has been a shift in facial behavior analysis from the laboratory-controlled conditions to the challenging in-the-wild conditions due to the superior performance of deep learning based approaches for many real world applications.However, the performance of deep learning approaches relies on the amount of training data. One of the major problems with data acquisition is the requirement of annotations for large amount of training data. Labeling process of huge training data demands lot of human support with strong domain expertise for facial expressions or action units, which is difficult to obtain in real-time environments.Moreover, labeling process is highly vulnerable to ambiguity of expressions or action units, especially for intensities due to the bias induced by the domain experts. Therefore, there is an imperative need to address the problem of facial behavior analysis with weak annotations. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of weakly supervised learning (WSL) approaches for facial behavior analysis with both categorical as well as dimensional labels along with the challenges and potential research directions associated with it. First, we introduce various types of weak annotations in the context of facial behavior analysis and the corresponding challenges associated with it. We then systematically review the existing state-of-the-art approaches and provide a taxonomy of these approaches along with their insights and limitations. In addition, widely used data-sets in the reviewed literature and the performance of these approaches along with evaluation principles are summarized. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and opportunities along with the potential research directions in order to apply facial behavior analysis with weak labels in real life situations.

<title>Revisiting Transformation Invariant Geometric Deep Learning: An Initial Representation Perspective</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved great success in the last decade. When designing neural networks to handle the ubiquitous geometric data such as point clouds and graphs, it is critical that the model can maintain invariance towards various transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. Most existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches can only maintain permutation-invariance, failing to guarantee invariance with respect to other transformations. Besides GNNs, other works design sophisticated transformation-invariant layers, which are computationally expensive and difficult to be extended. In this paper, we revisit why general neural networks cannot maintain transformation invariance. Our findings show that transformation-invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations are sufficient to achieve transformation invariance rather than needing sophisticated neural layer designs. Motivated by these findings, we propose Transformation Invariant Neural Networks (TinvNN), a straightforward and general plug-in for geometric data. Specifically, we realize transformation invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations by modifying multi-dimensional scaling and feed the representations into existing neural networks. We prove that TinvNN can strictly guarantee transformation invariance, being general and flexible enough to be combined with the existing neural networks. Extensive experimental results on point cloud analysis and combinatorial optimization demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of our method. We also extend our method into equivariance cases. Based on the results, we advocate that TinvNN should be considered as an essential baseline for further studies of transformation-invariant geometric deep learning.

Abstract: Biometric recognition as an efficient and hard-to-forge way of identification and verification has become an indispensable part of the current digital world. The fast evolution of this technology has been a strong incentive for integration into many applications. Meanwhile, blockchain, the decentralized ledger technology, has been widely received by both research and industry in the past few years, and it is being increasingly deployed today in many different applications, such as money transfer, IoT, healthcare, or logistics. Recently, researchers have started to speculate on the pros and cons and what the best applications would be when these two technologies cross paths. This paper provides a survey of the research literature on the combination of blockchain and biometrics and includes a first legal analysis of this integration based on GDPR to shed light on challenges and potentials. Although the integration of blockchain technology into the biometric sector is still in its infancy, with a growing body of literature discussing specific applications and advanced technological setups, this paper aims to provide a holistic understanding of blockchain applicability in biometrics. Based on published studies, this article discusses, among others, practical examples combining blockchain and biometrics for novel applications in PKI systems, distributed trusted services, and identity management. Challenges and limitations when combining blockchain and biometrics that motivate future work will also be discussed; e.g., blockchain networks at their current stage may not be efficient or economical for some real-time biometric applications. Finally, we also discuss key legal aspects of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) related to this combination of technologies (blockchain and biometrics); for example, accountability, immutability, anonymity, and data protection elements.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) technology has made significant strides with the emergence of deep learning. Typically, most existing FR models are built upon Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and take RGB face images as the model's input. In this work, we take a closer look at existing FR paradigms from high-efficiency, security, and precision perspectives, and identify the following three problems: (i) CNN frameworks are vulnerable in capturing global facial features and modeling the correlations between local facial features. (ii) Selecting RGB face images as the model's input greatly degrades the model's inference efficiency, increasing the extra computation costs. (iii) In the real-world FR system that operates on RGB face images, the integrity of user privacy may be compromised if hackers successfully penetrate and gain access to the input of this model. To solve these three issues, we propose two novel FR frameworks, i.e., TransFace and TransFace++, which successfully explore the feasibility of applying ViTs and image bytes to FR tasks, respectively. Experiments on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TransFace and TransFace++. Code is available at https://github.com/DanJun6737/TransFace_pp.

Abstract: Humans excel at forming mental maps of their surroundings, equipping them to understand object relationships and navigate based on language queries. Our previous work, SI Maps (Nanwani L, Agarwal A, Jain K, et al. Instance-level semantic maps for vision language navigation. In: 2023 32nd IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN). IEEE; 2023 Aug.), showed that having instance-level information and the semantic understanding of an environment helps significantly improve performance for language-guided tasks. We extend this instance-level approach to 3D while increasing the pipeline's robustness and improving quantitative and qualitative results. Our method leverages foundational models for object recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction. We propose a representation that results in a 3D point cloud map with instance-level embeddings, which bring in the semantic understanding that natural language commands can query. Quantitatively, the work improves upon the success rate of language-guided tasks. At the same time, we qualitatively observe the ability to identify instances more clearly and leverage the foundational models and language and image-aligned embeddings to identify objects that, otherwise, a closed-set approach wouldn't be able to identify.

We propose an equivariant attention mechanism that operates on features extracted by steerable convolutions. Operating in Fourier space, our network utilizes Fourier space non-linearities. Our experiments in both two and three dimensions show that adding steerable transformer layers to steerable convolutional networks enhances performance.

Abstract: Referring understanding is a fundamental task that bridges natural language and visual content by localizing objects described in free-form expressions. However, existing works are constrained by limited language expressiveness, lacking the capacity to model object dynamics in spatial numbers and temporal states. To address these limitations, we introduce a new and general referring understanding task, termed referring multi-object tracking (RMOT). Its core idea is to employ a language expression as a semantic cue to guide the prediction of multi-object tracking, comprehensively accounting for variations in object quantity and temporal semantics. Along with RMOT, we introduce a RMOT benchmark named Refer-KITTI-V2, featuring scalable and diverse language expressions. To efficiently generate high-quality annotations covering object dynamics with minimal manual effort, we propose a semi-automatic labeling pipeline that formulates a total of 9,758 language prompts. In addition, we propose TempRMOT, an elegant end-to-end Transformer-based framework for RMOT. At its core is a query-driven Temporal Enhancement Module that represents each object as a Transformer query, enabling long-term spatial-temporal interactions with other objects and past frames to efficiently refine these queries. TempRMOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Refer-KITTI and Refer-KITTI-V2, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The source code and dataset is available at https://github.com/zyn213/TempRMOT.

Abstract: Refusal behavior by Large Language Models is increasingly visible in content moderation, yet little is known about how refusals vary by the identity of the user making the request. This study investigates refusal as a sociotechnical outcome through a counterfactual persona design that varies gender identity--including male, female, non-binary, and transgender personas--while keeping the classification task and visual input constant. Focusing on a vision-language model (GPT-4V), we examine how identity-based language cues influence refusal in binary gender classification tasks. We find that transgender and non-binary personas experience significantly higher refusal rates, even in non-harmful contexts. Our findings also provide methodological implications for equity audits and content analysis using LLMs. Our findings underscore the importance of modeling identity-driven disparities and caution against uncritical use of AI systems for content coding. This study advances algorithmic fairness by reframing refusal as a communicative act that may unevenly regulate epistemic access and participation.

<title>RealCustom++: Representing Images as Real Textual Word for Real-Time Customization</title>

Abstract: Given a text and an image of a specific subject, text-to-image customization aims to generate new images that align with both the text and the subject's appearance. Existing works follow the pseudo-word paradigm, which represents the subject as a non-existent pseudo word and combines it with other text to generate images. However, the pseudo word causes semantic conflict from its different learning objective and entanglement from overlapping influence scopes with other texts, resulting in a dual-optimum paradox where subject similarity and text controllability cannot be optimal simultaneously. To address this, we propose RealCustom++, a novel real-word paradigm that represents the subject with a non-conflicting real word to firstly generate a coherent guidance image and corresponding subject mask, thereby disentangling the influence scopes of the text and subject for simultaneous optimization. Specifically, RealCustom++ introduces a train-inference decoupled framework: (1) during training, it learns a general alignment between visual conditions and all real words in the text; and (2) during inference, a dual-branch architecture is employed, where the Guidance Branch produces the subject guidance mask and the Generation Branch utilizes this mask to customize the generation of the specific real word exclusively within subject-relevant regions. In contrast to previous methods that excel in either controllability or similarity, RealCustom++ achieves superior performance in both, with improvements of 7.48% in controllability, 3.04% in similarity, and 76.43% in generation quality. For multi-subject customization, RealCustom++ further achieves improvements of 4.6% in controllability and 6.34% in multi-subject similarity. Our work has been applied in JiMeng of ByteDance, and codes are released at https://github.com/bytedance/RealCustom.

Abstract: Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Detection (MIAD), which utilizes 3D point clouds and 2D RGB images to identify abnormal regions in products, plays a crucial role in industrial quality inspection. However, traditional MIAD settings assume that all 2D and 3D modalities are paired, ignoring the fact that multimodal data collected from the real world is often imperfect due to missing modalities. Additionally, models trained on modality-incomplete data are prone to overfitting. Therefore, MIAD models that demonstrate robustness against modality-incomplete data are highly desirable in practice. To address this, we introduce a pioneering study that comprehensively investigates Modality-Incomplete Industrial Anomaly Detection (MIIAD), and under the guidance of experts, we construct the MIIAD Bench with rich modality-missing settings to account for imperfect learning environments with incomplete multimodal information. As expected, we find that most existing MIAD methods perform poorly on the MIIAD Bench, leading to significant performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel two-stage Robust modAlity-aware fusing and Detecting framewoRk, abbreviated as RADAR. Specifically: i) We propose Modality-incomplete Instruction to guide the multimodal Transformer to robustly adapt to various modality-incomplete scenarios, and implement adaptive parameter learning based on HyperNetwork. ii) Then, we construct a Double-Pseudo Hybrid Module to highlight the uniqueness of modality combinations, mitigating overfitting issues and further enhancing the robustness of the MIIAD model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RADAR significantly outperforms traditional MIAD methods on our newly created MIIAD dataset, proving its practical application value.

Abstract: Reconstruction of High Dynamic Range (HDR) from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images is an important computer vision task. There is a significant amount of research utilizing both conventional non-learning methods and modern data-driven approaches, focusing on using both single-exposed and multi-exposed LDR for HDR image reconstruction. However, most current state-of-the-art methods require high-quality paired {LDR;HDR} datasets with limited literature use of unpaired datasets, that is, methods that learn the LDR-HDR mapping between domains. This paper proposes CycleHDR, a method that integrates self-supervision into a modified semantic- and cycle-consistent adversarial architecture that utilizes unpaired LDR and HDR datasets for training. Our method introduces novel artifact- and exposure-aware generators to address visual artifact removal. It also puts forward an encoder and loss to address semantic consistency, another under-explored topic. CycleHDR is the first to use semantic and contextual awareness for the LDR-HDR reconstruction task in a self-supervised setup. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark datasets and reconstructs high-quality HDR images.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in generating photorealistic images, but challenges remain in ensuring precise semantic alignment with input prompts. Optimizing the initial noisy latent offers a more efficient alternative to modifying model architectures or prompt engineering for improving semantic alignment. A latest approach, InitNo, refines the initial noisy latent by leveraging attention maps; however, these maps capture only limited information, and the effectiveness of InitNo is highly dependent on the initial starting point, as it tends to converge on a local optimum near this point. To this end, this paper proposes leveraging the language comprehension capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to guide the optimization of the initial noisy latent, and introduces the Noise Diffusion process, which updates the noisy latent to generate semantically faithful images while preserving distribution consistency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the condition under which the update improves semantic faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our framework, consistently enhancing semantic alignment across various diffusion models.

Abstract: Face-swapping techniques have advanced rapidly with the evolution of deep learning, leading to widespread use and growing concerns about potential misuse, especially in cases of fraud. While many efforts have focused on detecting swapped face images or videos, these methods are insufficient for tracing the malicious users behind fraudulent activities. Intrusive watermark-based approaches also fail to trace unmarked identities, limiting their practical utility. To address these challenges, we introduce FaceTracer, the first non-intrusive framework specifically designed to trace the identity of the source person from swapped face images or videos. Specifically, FaceTracer leverages a disentanglement module that effectively suppresses identity information related to the target person while isolating the identity features of the source person. This allows us to extract robust identity information that can directly link the swapped face back to the original individual, aiding in uncovering the actors behind fraudulent activities. Extensive experiments demonstrate FaceTracer's effectiveness across various face-swapping techniques, successfully identifying the source person in swapped content and enabling the tracing of malicious actors involved in fraudulent activities. Additionally, FaceTracer shows strong transferability to unseen face-swapping methods including commercial applications and robustness against transmission distortions and adaptive attacks.Our code is available at: https://github.com/zzy224/FaceTracer.

Abstract: We present GS-ProCams, the first Gaussian Splatting-based framework for projector-camera systems (ProCams). GS-ProCams is not only view-agnostic but also significantly enhances the efficiency of projection mapping (PM) that requires establishing geometric and radiometric mappings between the projector and the camera. Previous CNN-based ProCams are constrained to a specific viewpoint, limiting their applicability to novel perspectives. In contrast, NeRF-based ProCams support view-agnostic projection mapping, however, they require an additional co-located light source and demand significant computational and memory resources. To address this issue, we propose GS-ProCams that employs 2D Gaussian for scene representations, and enables efficient view-agnostic ProCams applications. In particular, we explicitly model the complex geometric and photometric mappings of ProCams using projector responses, the projection surface's geometry and materials represented by Gaussians, and the global illumination component. Then, we employ differentiable physically-based rendering to jointly estimate them from captured multi-view projections. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, our GS-ProCams eliminates the need for additional devices, achieving superior ProCams simulation quality. It also uses only 1/10 of the GPU memory for training and is 900 times faster in inference speed. Please refer to our project page for the code and dataset: https://realqingyue.github.io/GS-ProCams/.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced photorealistic novel view synthesis, but their reliance on photometric reconstruction introduces artifacts, commonly known as "floaters". These artifacts degrade novel view quality, especially in areas unseen by the training cameras. We present a fast, post-hoc NeRF cleanup method that eliminates such artifacts by enforcing our Free Space Prior, effectively minimizing floaters without disrupting the NeRF's representation of observed regions. Unlike existing approaches that rely on either Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation to fit the data or a complex, local data-driven prior, our method adopts a Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) approach, selecting the optimal model parameters under a simple global prior assumption that unseen regions should remain empty. This enables our method to clean artifacts in both seen and unseen areas, enhancing novel view quality even in challenging scene regions. Our method is comparable with existing NeRF cleanup models while being 2.5x faster in inference time, requires no additional memory beyond the original NeRF, and achieves cleanup training in less than 30 seconds. Our code will be made publically available.

Abstract: Automatic prohibited item detection in X-ray images is crucial for public safety. However, most existing detection methods either rely on expensive box annotations to achieve high performance or use weak annotations but suffer from limited accuracy. To balance annotation cost and detection performance, we study Weakly Semi-Supervised X-ray Prohibited Item Detection with Points (WSSPID-P) and propose a novel \textbf{B}oundary-\textbf{C}ategory \textbf{R}efinement \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{BCR-Net}) that requires only a few box annotations and a large number of point annotations. BCR-Net is built based on Group R-CNN and introduces a new Boundary Refinement (BR) module and a new Category Refinement (CR) module. The BR module develops a dual attention mechanism to focus on both the boundaries and salient features of prohibited items. Meanwhile, the CR module incorporates contrastive branches into the heads of RPN and ROI by introducing a scale- and rotation-aware contrastive loss, enhancing intra-class consistency and inter-class separability in the feature space. Based on the above designs, BCR-Net effectively addresses the closely related problems of imprecise localization and inaccurate classification. Experimental results on public X-ray datasets show the effectiveness of BCR-Net, achieving significant performance improvements to state-of-the-art methods under limited annotations.

<title>NVS-SQA: Exploring Self-Supervised Quality Representation Learning for Neurally Synthesized Scenes without References</title>

Abstract: Neural View Synthesis (NVS), such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, effectively creates photorealistic scenes from sparse viewpoints, typically evaluated by quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. However, these full-reference methods, which compare synthesized views to reference views, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of neurally synthesized scenes (NSS), particularly due to the limited availability of dense reference views. Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder the creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, we propose NVS-SQA, a NSS quality assessment method to learn no-reference quality representations through self-supervision without reliance on human labels. Traditional self-supervised learning predominantly relies on the "same instance, similar representation" assumption and extensive datasets. However, given that these conditions do not apply in NSS quality assessment, we employ heuristic cues and quality scores as learning objectives, along with a specialized contrastive pair preparation process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. The results show that NVS-SQA outperforms 17 no-reference methods by a large margin (i.e., on average 109.5% in SRCC, 98.6% in PLCC, and 91.5% in KRCC over the second best) and even exceeds 16 full-reference methods across all evaluation metrics (i.e., 22.9% in SRCC, 19.1% in PLCC, and 18.6% in KRCC over the second best).

Abstract: Video causal reasoning aims to achieve a high-level understanding of videos from a causal perspective. However, it exhibits limitations in its scope, primarily executed in a question-answering paradigm and focusing on brief video segments containing isolated events and basic causal relations, lacking comprehensive and structured causality analysis for videos with multiple interconnected events. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task and dataset, Multi-Event Causal Discovery (MECD). It aims to uncover the causal relations between events distributed chronologically across long videos. Given visual segments and textual descriptions of events, MECD identifies the causal associations between these events to derive a comprehensive and structured event-level video causal graph explaining why and how the result event occurred. To address the challenges of MECD, we devise a novel framework inspired by the Granger Causality method, incorporating an efficient mask-based event prediction model to perform an Event Granger Test. It estimates causality by comparing the predicted result event when premise events are masked versus unmasked. Furthermore, we integrate causal inference techniques such as front-door adjustment and counterfactual inference to mitigate challenges in MECD like causality confounding and illusory causality. Additionally, context chain reasoning is introduced to conduct more robust and generalized reasoning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in reasoning complete causal relations, outperforming GPT-4o and VideoChat2 by 5.77% and 2.70%, respectively. Further experiments demonstrate that causal relation graphs can also contribute to downstream video understanding tasks such as video question answering and video event prediction.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved significant advances through rectified flow techniques, but issues like unsmooth motion and misalignment between videos and prompts persist. In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation model. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models. These include two training-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video quality needs.

Abstract: Multimodal models often experience a significant performance drop when one or more modalities are missing during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality without requiring explicit modality generation or auxiliary networks. To efficiently learn these approximations with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning. The code for this paper is available at: https://github.com/CSIPlab/Cross-Modal-Proxy-Tokens.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks are widely used to evaluate model robustness, and in black-box scenarios, the transferability of these attacks becomes crucial. Existing generator-based attacks have excellent generalization and transferability due to their instance-agnostic nature. However, when training generators for multi-target tasks, the success rate of transfer attacks is relatively low due to the limitations of the model's capacity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Flow framework for multi-target instance-agnostic adversarial attacks, utilizing Cascading Distribution Shift Training to develop an adversarial velocity function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dual-Flow significantly improves transferability over previous multi-target generative attacks. For example, it increases the success rate from Inception-v3 to ResNet-152 by 34.58\%. Furthermore, our attack method shows substantially stronger robustness against defense mechanisms, such as adversarially trained models. The code of Dual-Flow is available at: $\href{https://github.com/Chyxx/Dual-Flow}{https://github.com/Chyxx/Dual-Flow}$.

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely employed in safety-critical applications yet remain susceptible to adversarial attacks -- imperceptible perturbations that can significantly degrade model performance. Conventional defense mechanisms predominantly focus on either enhancing model robustness or detecting adversarial inputs independently. In this work, we propose an Unsupervised adversarial detection via Contrastive Auxiliary Networks (U-CAN) to uncover adversarial behavior within auxiliary feature representations, without the need for adversarial examples. U-CAN is embedded within selected intermediate layers of the target model. These auxiliary networks, comprising projection layers and ArcFace-based linear layers, refine feature representations to more effectively distinguish between benign and adversarial inputs. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, Mammals, and a subset of ImageNet) and architectures (ResNet-50, VGG-16, and ViT) demonstrate that our method surpasses existing unsupervised adversarial detection techniques, achieving superior F1 scores against four distinct attack methods. The proposed framework provides a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the security and reliability of deep learning systems.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that diffusion models can achieve font-controllable multilingual text rendering using just raw images without font label annotations.Visual text rendering remains a significant challenge. While recent methods condition diffusion on glyphs, it is impossible to retrieve exact font annotations from large-scale, real-world datasets, which prevents user-specified font control. To address this, we propose a data-driven solution that integrates the conditional diffusion model with a text segmentation model, utilizing segmentation masks to capture and represent fonts in pixel space in a self-supervised manner, thereby eliminating the need for any ground-truth labels and enabling users to customize text rendering with any multilingual font of their choice. The experiment provides a proof of concept of our algorithm in zero-shot text and font editing across diverse fonts and languages, providing valuable insights for the community and industry toward achieving generalized visual text rendering.

Abstract: Zero-shot object counting aims to count instances of arbitrary object categories specified by text descriptions. Existing methods typically rely on vision-language models like CLIP, but often exhibit limited sensitivity to text prompts. We present T2ICount, a diffusion-based framework that leverages rich prior knowledge and fine-grained visual understanding from pretrained diffusion models. While one-step denoising ensures efficiency, it leads to weakened text sensitivity. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic Correction Module that progressively refines text-image feature alignment, and a Representational Regional Coherence Loss that provides reliable supervision signals by leveraging the cross-attention maps extracted from the denosing U-Net. Furthermore, we observe that current benchmarks mainly focus on majority objects in images, potentially masking models' text sensitivity. To address this, we contribute a challenging re-annotated subset of FSC147 for better evaluation of text-guided counting ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across different benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/cha15yq/T2ICount.

Abstract: Neural networks are regularly employed in high-stakes decision-making, where understanding and transparency is key. Attribution methods have been developed to gain understanding into which input features neural networks use for a specific prediction. Although widely used in computer vision, these methods often result in unspecific saliency maps that fail to identify the relevant information that led to a decision, supported by different benchmarks results. Here, we revisit the common attribution pipeline and identify one cause for the lack of specificity in attributions as the computation of attribution of isolated logits. Instead, we suggest to combine attributions of multiple class logits in analogy to how the softmax combines the information across logits. By computing probability distributions of attributions over classes for each spatial location in the image, we unleash the true capabilities of existing attribution methods, revealing better object- and instance-specificity and uncovering discriminative as well as shared features between classes. On common benchmarks, including the grid-pointing game and randomization-based sanity checks, we show that this reconsideration of how and where we compute attributions across the network improves established attribution methods while staying agnostic to model architectures. We make the code publicly available: https://github.com/nilspwalter/var.

Abstract: Inversion-based image editing is rapidly gaining momentum while suffering from significant computation overhead, hindering its application in real-time interactive scenarios. In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

Abstract: Despite promising performance on open-source large vision-language models (LVLMs), transfer-based targeted attacks often fail against closed-source commercial LVLMs. Analyzing failed adversarial perturbations reveals that the learned perturbations typically originate from a uniform distribution and lack clear semantic details, resulting in unintended responses. This critical absence of semantic information leads commercial black-box LVLMs to either ignore the perturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing the attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we propose to refine semantic clarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus ensuring the capture of finer-grained features and inter-model transferability, and by concentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying them uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective baseline: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly by a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the target image in the embedding space. While the naive source-target matching method has been utilized before in the literature, we are the first to provide a tight analysis, which establishes a close connection between perturbation optimization and semantics. Experimental results confirm our hypothesis. Our adversarial examples crafted with local-aggregated perturbations focused on crucial regions exhibit surprisingly good transferability to commercial LVLMs, including GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Claude-3.5/3.7-sonnet, and even reasoning models like o1, Claude-3.7-thinking and Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking. Our approach achieves success rates exceeding 90% on GPT-4.5, 4o, and o1, significantly outperforming all prior state-of-the-art attack methods with lower $\ell_1/\ell_2$ perturbations.

<title>Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models have enhanced video editing, but it remains challenging to handle instructional editing and diverse tasks (e.g., adding, removing, changing) within a unified framework. In this paper, we introduce VEGGIE, a Video Editor with Grounded Generation from Instructions, a simple end-to-end framework that unifies video concept editing, grounding, and reasoning based on diverse user instructions. Specifically, given a video and text query, VEGGIE first utilizes an MLLM to interpret user intentions in instructions and ground them to the video contexts, generating frame-specific grounded task queries for pixel-space responses. A diffusion model then renders these plans and generates edited videos that align with user intent. To support diverse tasks and complex instructions, we employ a curriculum learning strategy: first aligning the MLLM and video diffusion model with large-scale instructional image editing data, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning on high-quality multitask video data. Additionally, we introduce a novel data synthesis pipeline to generate paired instructional video editing data for model training. It transforms static image data into diverse, high-quality video editing samples by leveraging Image-to-Video models to inject dynamics. VEGGIE shows strong performance in instructional video editing with different editing skills, outperforming the best instructional baseline as a versatile model, while other models struggle with multi-tasking. VEGGIE also excels in video object grounding and reasoning segmentation, where other baselines fail. We further reveal how the multiple tasks help each other and highlight promising applications like zero-shot multimodal instructional and in-context video editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality and temporal coherence. Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics. Our project page are publicly available at https://quanhaol.github.io/magicmotion-site.

Abstract: Prior work using Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) typically relies on random patch masking based on the assumption that images have significant redundancies across different channels, allowing for the reconstruction of masked content using cross-channel correlations. However, this assumption does not hold in Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI), where channels may provide complementary information with minimal feature overlap. Thus, these MAEs primarily learn local structures within individual channels from patch reconstruction, failing to fully leverage cross-channel interactions and limiting their MCI effectiveness. In this paper, we present ChA-MAEViT, an MAE-based method that enhances feature learning across MCI channels via four key strategies: (1) dynamic channel-patch masking, which compels the model to reconstruct missing channels in addition to masked patches, thereby enhancing cross-channel dependencies and improving robustness to varying channel configurations; (2) memory tokens, which serve as long-term memory aids to promote information sharing across channels, addressing the challenges of reconstructing structurally diverse channels; (3) hybrid token fusion module, which merges fine-grained patch tokens with a global class token to capture richer representations; and (4) Channel-Aware Decoder, a lightweight decoder utilizes channel tokens to effectively reconstruct image patches. Experiments on satellite and microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, show that ChA-MAEViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MCI-ViTs by 3.0-21.5%, highlighting the importance of cross-channel interactions in MCI.

Abstract: We introduce ORIGEN, the first zero-shot method for 3D orientation grounding in text-to-image generation across multiple objects and diverse categories. While previous work on spatial grounding in image generation has mainly focused on 2D positioning, it lacks control over 3D orientation. To address this, we propose a reward-guided sampling approach using a pretrained discriminative model for 3D orientation estimation and a one-step text-to-image generative flow model. While gradient-ascent-based optimization is a natural choice for reward-based guidance, it struggles to maintain image realism. Instead, we adopt a sampling-based approach using Langevin dynamics, which extends gradient ascent by simply injecting random noise--requiring just a single additional line of code. Additionally, we introduce adaptive time rescaling based on the reward function to accelerate convergence. Our experiments show that ORIGEN outperforms both training-based and test-time guidance methods across quantitative metrics and user studies.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary querying in 3D space is crucial for enabling more intelligent perception in applications such as robotics, autonomous systems, and augmented reality. However, most existing methods rely on 2D pixel-level parsing, leading to multi-view inconsistencies and poor 3D object retrieval. Moreover, they are limited to static scenes and struggle with dynamic scenes due to the complexities of motion modeling. In this paper, we propose Segment then Splat, a 3D-aware open vocabulary segmentation approach for both static and dynamic scenes based on Gaussian Splatting. Segment then Splat reverses the long established approach of "segmentation after reconstruction" by dividing Gaussians into distinct object sets before reconstruction. Once reconstruction is complete, the scene is naturally segmented into individual objects, achieving true 3D segmentation. This design eliminates both geometric and semantic ambiguities, as well as Gaussian-object misalignment issues in dynamic scenes. It also accelerates the optimization process, as it eliminates the need for learning a separate language field. After optimization, a CLIP embedding is assigned to each object to enable open-vocabulary querying. Extensive experiments one various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in both static and dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Personalized facial expression recognition (FER) involves adapting a machine learning model using samples from labeled sources and unlabeled target domains. Given the challenges of recognizing subtle expressions with considerable interpersonal variability, state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods focus on the multi-source UDA (MSDA) setting, where each domain corresponds to a specific subject, and improve model accuracy and robustness. However, when adapting to a specific target, the diverse nature of multiple source domains translates to a large shift between source and target data. State-of-the-art MSDA methods for FER address this domain shift by considering all the sources to adapt to the target representations. Nevertheless, adapting to a target subject presents significant challenges due to large distributional differences between source and target domains, often resulting in negative transfer. In addition, integrating all sources simultaneously increases computational costs and causes misalignment with the target. To address these issues, we propose a progressive MSDA approach that gradually introduces information from subjects based on their similarity to the target subject. This will ensure that only the most relevant sources from the target are selected, which helps avoid the negative transfer caused by dissimilar sources. We first exploit the closest sources to reduce the distribution shift with the target and then move towards the furthest while only considering the most relevant sources based on the predetermined threshold. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting caused by the incremental introduction of source subjects, we implemented a density-based memory mechanism that preserves the most relevant historical source samples for adaptation.

Abstract: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have become one of the fundamental architectural component in point cloud analysis due to its effective feature learning mechanism. However, when processing complex geometric structures in point clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture local geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and high model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate their efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the model's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature Processing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and global context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and overall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the Global Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive field gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric information of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and computational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the PointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN outperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning task. Additionally, PointKAN achieves substantial reductions in parameter counts and computational complexity (FLOPs). This work highlights the potential of KANs-based architectures in 3D vision and opens new avenues for research in point cloud understanding.

Abstract: Event cameras offer a promising avenue for multi-view stereo depth estimation and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) due to their ability to detect blur-free 3D edges at high-speed and over broad illumination conditions. However, traditional deep learning frameworks designed for conventional cameras struggle with the asynchronous, stream-like nature of event data, as their architectures are optimized for discrete, image-like inputs. We propose a scalable, flexible and adaptable framework for pixel-wise depth estimation with event cameras in both monocular and stereo setups. The 3D scene structure is encoded into disparity space images (DSIs), representing spatial densities of rays obtained by back-projecting events into space via known camera poses. Our neural network processes local subregions of the DSIs combining 3D convolutions and a recurrent structure to recognize valuable patterns for depth prediction. Local processing enables fast inference with full parallelization and ensures constant ultra-low model complexity and memory costs, regardless of camera resolution. Experiments on standard benchmarks (MVSEC and DSEC datasets) demonstrate unprecedented effectiveness: (i) using purely monocular data, our method achieves comparable results to existing stereo methods; (ii) when applied to stereo data, it strongly outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, reducing the mean absolute error by at least 42%; (iii) our method also allows for increases in depth completeness by more than 3-fold while still yielding a reduction in median absolute error of at least 30%. Given its remarkable performance and effective processing of event-data, our framework holds strong potential to become a standard approach for using deep learning for event-based depth estimation and SLAM.

Abstract: Emotion understanding is a critical yet challenging task. Most existing approaches rely heavily on identity-sensitive information, such as facial expressions and speech, which raises concerns about personal privacy. To address this, we introduce the De-identity Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning (DEEMO), a novel task designed to enable emotion understanding using de-identified video and audio inputs. The DEEMO dataset consists of two subsets: DEEMO-NFBL, which includes rich annotations of Non-Facial Body Language (NFBL), and DEEMO-MER, an instruction dataset for Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning using identity-free cues. This design supports emotion understanding without compromising identity privacy. In addition, we propose DEEMO-LLaMA, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates de-identified audio, video, and textual information to enhance both emotion recognition and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that DEEMO-LLaMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, outperforming existing MLLMs by a significant margin, achieving 74.49% accuracy and 74.45% F1-score in de-identity emotion recognition, and 6.20 clue overlap and 7.66 label overlap in de-identity emotion reasoning. Our work contributes to ethical AI by advancing privacy-preserving emotion understanding and promoting responsible affective computing.

Abstract: Disparity compensation represents the primary strategy in stereo video compression (SVC) for exploiting cross-view redundancy. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized into two types: one that employs explicit horizontal shifting, and another that utilizes an implicit cross-attention mechanism to reduce cross-view disparity redundancy. In this work, we propose a hybrid disparity compensation (HDC) strategy that leverages explicit pixel displacement as a robust prior feature to simplify optimization and perform implicit cross-attention mechanisms for subsequent warping operations, thereby capturing a broader range of disparity information. Specifically, HDC first computes a similarity map by fusing the horizontally shifted cross-view features to capture pixel displacement information. This similarity map is then normalized into an "explicit pixel-wise attention score" to perform the cross-attention mechanism, implicitly aligning features from one view to another. Building upon HDC, we introduce a novel end-to-end optimized neural stereo video compression framework, which integrates HDC-based modules into key coding operations, including cross-view feature extraction and reconstruction (HDC-FER) and cross-view entropy modeling (HDC-EM). Extensive experiments on SVC benchmarks, including KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, and Nagoya, which cover both autonomous driving and general scenes, demonstrate that our framework outperforms both neural and traditional SVC methodologies.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong results in video understanding, yet a key question remains: do they truly comprehend visual content or only learn shallow correlations between vision and language? Real visual understanding, especially of physics and common sense, is essential for AI systems that interact with the physical world. Current evaluations mostly use real-world videos similar to training data, so high benchmark scores may not reflect real reasoning ability. To address this, we propose negative-control tests using videos that depict physically impossible or logically inconsistent events. We introduce VideoHallu, a synthetic dataset of physics- and commonsense-violating scenes generated with Veo2, Sora, and Kling. It includes expert-annotated question-answer pairs across four categories of violations. Tests of leading VLMs (Qwen-2.5-VL, Video-R1, VideoChat-R1) show that, despite strong results on benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU, they often miss these violations, exposing gaps in visual reasoning. Reinforcement learning fine-tuning on VideoHallu improves recognition of such violations without reducing standard benchmark performance. Our data is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.git.

<title>Learning Knowledge-based Prompts for Robust 3D Mask Presentation Attack Detection</title>

Abstract: 3D mask presentation attack detection is crucial for protecting face recognition systems against the rising threat of 3D mask attacks. While most existing methods utilize multimodal features or remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals to distinguish between real faces and 3D masks, they face significant challenges, such as the high costs associated with multimodal sensors and limited generalization ability. Detection-related text descriptions offer concise, universal information and are cost-effective to obtain. However, the potential of vision-language multimodal features for 3D mask presentation attack detection remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-based prompt learning framework to explore the strong generalization capability of vision-language models for 3D mask presentation attack detection. Specifically, our approach incorporates entities and triples from knowledge graphs into the prompt learning process, generating fine-grained, task-specific explicit prompts that effectively harness the knowledge embedded in pre-trained vision-language models. Furthermore, considering different input images may emphasize distinct knowledge graph elements, we introduce a visual-specific knowledge filter based on an attention mechanism to refine relevant elements according to the visual context. Additionally, we leverage causal graph theory insights into the prompt learning process to further enhance the generalization ability of our method. During training, a spurious correlation elimination paradigm is employed, which removes category-irrelevant local image patches using guidance from knowledge-based text features, fostering the learning of generalized causal prompts that align with category-relevant local patches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art intra- and cross-scenario detection performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method to integrate online policy gradient reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original number of inference steps, significantly improving sampling efficiency without sacrificing performance. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For compositional generation, RL-tuned SD3.5-M generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, increasing GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, greatly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.

Abstract: Introduction: Timely identification of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) subtypes on non-contrast computed tomography is critical for prognosis prediction and therapeutic decision-making, yet remains challenging due to low contrast and blurring boundaries. This study evaluates the performance of zero-shot multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) compared to traditional deep learning methods in ICH binary classification and subtyping. Methods: We utilized a dataset provided by RSNA, comprising 192 NCCT volumes. The study compares various MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2, with conventional deep learning models, including ResNet50 and Vision Transformer. Carefully crafted prompts were used to guide MLLMs in tasks such as ICH presence, subtype classification, localization, and volume estimation. Results: The results indicate that in the ICH binary classification task, traditional deep learning models outperform MLLMs comprehensively. For subtype classification, MLLMs also exhibit inferior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, with Gemini 2.0 Flash achieving an macro-averaged precision of 0.41 and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.31. Conclusion: While MLLMs excel in interactive capabilities, their overall accuracy in ICH subtyping is inferior to deep networks. However, MLLMs enhance interpretability through language interactions, indicating potential in medical imaging analysis. Future efforts will focus on model refinement and developing more precise MLLMs to improve performance in three-dimensional medical image processing.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in multimodal tasks, with multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) further enhancing performance and interpretability. Recent MCoT methods fall into two categories: (i) Textual-MCoT (T-MCoT), which takes multimodal input and produces textual output; and (ii) Interleaved-MCoT (I-MCoT), which generates interleaved image-text outputs. Despite advances in both approaches, the mechanisms driving these improvements are not fully understood. To fill this gap, we first reveal that MCoT boosts LVLMs by incorporating visual thoughts, which convey image information to the reasoning process regardless of the MCoT format, depending only on clarity and conciseness of expression. Furthermore, to explore visual thoughts systematically, we define four distinct forms of visual thought expressions and analyze them comprehensively. Our findings demonstrate that these forms differ in clarity and conciseness, yielding varying levels of MCoT improvement. Additionally, we explore the internal nature of visual thoughts, finding that visual thoughts serve as intermediaries between the input image and reasoning to deeper transformer layers, enabling more advanced visual information transmission. We hope that the visual thoughts can inspire further breakthroughs for future MCoT research.

Abstract: The use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) such as Stable Diffusion has significantly improved the perceptual quality of All-in-One image Restoration (AiOR) methods, while also enhancing their generalization capabilities. However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach for image generation, performs scale-space autoregression and achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. Moreover, our analysis reveals that coarse scales in VAR primarily capture degradations while finer scales encode scene detail, simplifying the restoration process. Motivated by this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel VAR-based generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $10\times$ faster inference. To optimally exploit the advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enabled promising applications in medical tasks, such as report generation and visual question answering. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench, a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements, computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance, enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases, each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 12 evaluated LVLMs struggle with structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/GRE.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in understanding complex real-world scenarios and supporting data-driven decision-making processes. However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack (VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking, hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/Trustworthy-AI-Group/VMA.

Abstract: Real-world objects are composed of distinctive, object-specific parts. Identifying these parts is key to performing fine-grained, compositional reasoning-yet, large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to perform this seemingly straightforward task. In this work, we introduce PARTONOMY, an LMM benchmark designed for pixel-level part grounding. We construct PARTONOMY from existing part datasets and our own rigorously annotated set of images, encompassing 862 part labels and 534 object labels for evaluation. Unlike existing datasets that simply ask models to identify generic parts, PARTONOMY uses specialized concepts (e.g., agricultural airplane), and challenges models to compare objects' parts, consider part-whole relationships, and justify textual predictions with visual segmentations. Our experiments demonstrate significant limitations in state-of-the-art LMMs (e.g., LISA-13B achieves only 5.9% gIoU), highlighting a critical gap in their part grounding abilities. We note that existing segmentation-enabled LMMs (segmenting LMMs) have two key architectural shortcomings: they use special [SEG] tokens not seen during pretraining which induce distribution shift, and they discard predicted segmentations instead of using past predictions to guide future ones. To address these deficiencies, we train several part-centric LMMs and propose PLUM, a novel segmenting LMM that uses span tagging instead of segmentation tokens and that conditions on prior predictions in a feedback loop. We find that pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on reasoning segmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination benchmarks. In addition, PLUM finetuned on our proposed Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive with segmenting LMMs trained on significantly more segmentation data. Our work opens up new avenues towards enabling fine-grained, grounded visual understanding in LMMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual understanding, but their application to long-term Earth observation analysis remains limited, primarily focusing on single-temporal or bi-temporal imagery. To address this gap, we introduce DVL-Suite, a comprehensive framework for analyzing long-term urban dynamics through remote sensing imagery. Our suite comprises 14,871 high-resolution (1.0m) multi-temporal images spanning 42 major cities in the U.S. from 2005 to 2023, organized into two components: DVL-Bench and DVL-Instruct. The DVL-Bench includes six urban understanding tasks, from fundamental change detection (pixel-level) to quantitative analyses (regional-level) and comprehensive urban narratives (scene-level), capturing diverse urban dynamics including expansion/transformation patterns, disaster assessment, and environmental challenges. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal their limitations in long-term temporal understanding and quantitative analysis. These challenges motivate the creation of DVL-Instruct, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset designed to enhance models' capabilities in multi-temporal Earth observation. Building upon this dataset, we develop DVLChat, a baseline model capable of both image-level question-answering and pixel-level segmentation, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of city dynamics through language interactions.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient method to combine multiple single-task fine-tuned models. The merged model can enjoy multi-task capabilities without expensive training. While promising, merging into a single model often suffers from an accuracy gap with respect to the fine-tuned models. On the other hand, deploying all individual fine-tuned models incurs high storage costs. We propose FlexMerge, a novel data-free model merging framework that: (a) flexibly generates merged models of varying sizes, spanning the full spectrum from a single merged model to retaining all fine-tuned models; and (b) supports multiple merging algorithms in a unified framework. Using FlexMerge, we systematically characterize the accuracy-size trade-off of different algorithms. Our study reveals two key findings: first, even modestly larger merged models can yield steep accuracy gains (up to 13.5% when just doubling the size); second, algorithm rankings are not consistent as size increases, with some methods overtaking others beyond the one-model regime. These results uncover a new design dimension for model merging: developing and comparing algorithms across the full spectrum of sizes rather than only at the single-model limit. Extensive experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks, with up to 30 tasks, confirm the generality and practicality of FlexMerge.

Abstract: We introduce an inference-time scene optimization algorithm utilizing triangle soup, a collection of disconnected translucent triangle primitives, as the representation for the geometry and appearance of a scene. Unlike full-rank Gaussian kernels, triangles are a natural, locally-flat proxy for surfaces that can be connected to achieve highly complex geometry. When coupled with per-vertex Spherical Harmonics (SH), triangles provide a rich visual representation without incurring an expensive increase in primitives. We leverage our new representation to incorporate optimization objectives and enforce spatial regularization directly on the underlying primitives. The main differentiator of our approach is the definition and enforcement of soft connectivity forces between triangles during optimization, encouraging explicit, but soft, surface continuity in 3D. Experiments on representative 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis datasets show improvements in geometric accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art algorithms without sacrificing visual fidelity.

Abstract: We propose a method for discovering and visualizing the differences between two learned representations, enabling more direct and interpretable model comparisons. We validate our method, which we call Representational Differences Explanations (RDX), by using it to compare models with known conceptual differences and demonstrate that it recovers meaningful distinctions where existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques fail. Applied to state-of-the-art models on challenging subsets of the ImageNet and iNaturalist datasets, RDX reveals both insightful representational differences and subtle patterns in the data. Although comparison is a cornerstone of scientific analysis, current tools in machine learning, namely post hoc XAI methods, struggle to support model comparison effectively. Our work addresses this gap by introducing an effective and explainable tool for contrasting model representations.

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings (e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image 3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization. Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches, establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation.

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes each private image into a concise textual description using image to text models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images, greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers - the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps (Darcet et al., 2024). We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models, yielding cleaner attention-based, text-to-image attribution. Finally, we outline a simple mathematical model that reflects the observed behavior of register neurons and high norm tokens. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering groups pixels into clusters without labeled data, which is an important yet challenging task. For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jhqi/SSGCO-EGAEL.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for clinical decision support, yet existing efforts primarily focus on 2D imaging with limited task diversity. This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset encompasses six diverse VQA tasks: anomaly detection, image observation, medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language models (VLMs), especially medical VLMs exhibit limited generalization, particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world 3D diagnostic reasoning. To drive future advancements, we release a high-quality training set 3D-RAD-T of 136,195 expert-aligned samples, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset could significantly enhance model performance. Our dataset and code, aiming to catalyze multimodal medical AI research and establish a robust foundation for 3D medical visual understanding, are publicly available at https://github.com/Tang-xiaoxiao/3D-RAD.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Image-based cell profiling aims to create informative representations of cell images. This technique is critical in drug discovery and has greatly advanced with recent improvements in computer vision. Inspired by recent developments in non-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), this paper provides an initial exploration into training a generalizable feature extractor for cell images using such methods. However, there are two major challenges: 1) Unlike typical scenarios where each representation is based on a single image, cell profiling often involves multiple input images, making it difficult to effectively fuse all available information; and 2) There is a large difference between the distributions of cell images and natural images, causing the view-generation process in existing SSL methods to fail. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised framework with local aggregation to improve cross-site consistency of cell representations. We introduce specialized data augmentation and representation post-processing methods tailored to cell images, which effectively address the issues mentioned above and result in a robust feature extractor. With these improvements, the proposed framework won the Cell Line Transferability challenge at CVPR 2025.

Abstract: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0% gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress, existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.8% and FPR@95 by 9.4% over the second best.

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge. Our code is available at https://github.com/rain152/IPVG.

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples, computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared, higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16 different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness. The code for THUNDER is publicly available at https://github.com/MICS-Lab/thunder.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel direction to build an image tokenizer directly on top of a frozen vision foundation model, which is a largely underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation -- achieving a gFID of 1.36 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code is available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/VFMTok.

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced data, we aim to improve the diversity and fidelity of tail class images without compromising the quality of head class images. We achieve this by introducing two simple but highly effective loss functions. Firstly, we employ an Unsupervised Contrastive Loss (UCL) utilizing negative samples to increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images. Such regularization is coupled with a standard trick of batch resampling to further diversify tail-class images. Our second loss is an Alignment Loss (AL) that aligns class-conditional generation with unconditional generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. We successfully leverage contrastive learning and conditional-unconditional alignment for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our framework is easy to implement as demonstrated on both U-Net based architecture and Diffusion Transformer. Our method outperforms vanilla denoising diffusion probabilistic models, score-based diffusion model, and alternative methods for class-imbalanced image generation across various datasets, in particular ImageNet-LT with 256x256 resolution.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation space by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal understanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix, PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry, semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage, we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer. Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without additional training costs. Our code is available at https://jus1mple.github.io/Image2CaptionAttack.

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information and global context, effectively mitigating interference from category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we propose S$^2$Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for V-DMs that leverages Salient data and Sparse token distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs. Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6 quantization, S$^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering $3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will be available at https://github.com/wlfeng0509/s2q-vdit.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits. We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses this trilemma through two key innovations. First, Selective Canny Control applies structural guidance from a Canny ControlNet only to the unedited regions, preserving the original image's details while allowing for precise, text-driven changes in the specified editable area. Second, Dual-Prompt Guidance utilizes both a local prompt for the specific edit and a global prompt for overall scene coherence. Through this synergistic approach, these components enable controllable local editing for object addition, replacement, and removal, achieving a superior trade-off among text adherence, context fidelity, and editing seamlessness compared to current region-based methods. Beyond this, CannyEdit offers exceptional flexibility: it operates effectively with rough masks or even single-point hints in addition tasks. Furthermore, the framework can seamlessly integrate with vision-language models in a training-free manner for complex instruction-based editing that requires planning and reasoning. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate CannyEdit's strong performance against leading instruction-based editors in complex object addition scenarios.

Abstract: The field of visual and audio generation is burgeoning with new state-of-the-art methods. This rapid proliferation of new techniques underscores the need for robust solutions for detecting synthetic content in videos. In particular, when fine-grained alterations via localized manipulations are performed in visual, audio, or both domains, these subtle modifications add challenges to the detection algorithms. This paper presents solutions for the problems of deepfake video classification and localization. The methods were submitted to the ACM 1M Deepfakes Detection Challenge, achieving the best performance in the temporal localization task and a top four ranking in the classification task for the TestA split of the evaluation dataset.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection models: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12, followed by development of a custom model derived from YOLOv8 with added structures for challenging surveillance contexts. The proposed model outperformed the others, achieving a recall of 78.90 percent and mAP at 50 of 83.70 percent, delivering optimal object detection across varied environments. Performance evaluation on multiple edge devices using multithreaded operations showed the Jetson Xavier NX processed data at 52 to 97 milliseconds per inference, establishing its suitability for time-sensitive operations. This system offers a robust and adaptable platform for monitoring public safety and enabling automatic regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Abstract: Audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to detect event categories and their temporal boundaries in videos, typically under weak supervision. Existing methods mainly focus on (i) improving temporal modeling using attention-based architectures or (ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to address the absence of frame-level annotations. However, attention-based models often overfit noisy pseudo-labels, leading to cumulative training errors, while pseudo-label generation approaches distribute attention uniformly across frames, weakening temporal localization accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose TEn-CATG, a text-enriched AVVP framework that combines semantic calibration with category-aware temporal reasoning. More specifically, we design a bi-directional text fusion (BiT) module by leveraging audio-visual features as semantic anchors to refine text embeddings, which departs from conventional text-to-feature alignment, thereby mitigating noise and enhancing cross-modal consistency. Furthermore, we introduce the category-aware temporal graph (CATG) module to model temporal relationships by selecting multi-scale temporal neighbors and learning category-specific temporal decay factors, enabling effective event-dependent temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TEn-CATG achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple evaluation metrics on benchmark datasets LLP and UnAV-100, highlighting its robustness and superior ability to capture complex temporal and semantic dependencies in weakly supervised AVVP tasks.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research introduces ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel multimodal deep learning framework that classifies musculoskeletal risk using both visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. A custom multimodal dataset (MusDis-Sports) was created by combining images and skeletal coordinates, with each sample labeled into eight risk categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) system. ViSK-GAT integrates two innovative modules: the Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which refines inter-modal features via cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal alignment between image features and coordinates. The model achieved robust performance, with all key metrics exceeding 93%. Regression results also indicated a low RMSE of 0.1205 and MAE of 0.0156. ViSK-GAT consistently outperformed nine popular transfer learning backbones and showed its potential to advance AI-driven musculoskeletal risk assessment and enable early, impactful interventions in sports.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours, post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit 6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and neurodegenerative disorders. Although SA-UNet introduces spatial attention in the bottleneck, it underuses attention in skip connections and does not address the severe foreground-background imbalance. We propose SA-UNetv2, a lightweight model that injects cross-scale spatial attention into all skip connections to strengthen multi-scale feature fusion and adopts a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) loss to improve robustness to class imbalance. On the public DRIVE and STARE datasets, SA-UNetv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1.2MB memory and 0.26M parameters (less than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592 x 592 x 3 images, demonstrating strong efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained, CPU-only settings.

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet, conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive, contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset. Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness. Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models, attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods offer superior generalization capability and real-time deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine spatial positions. This dependence results in reconstruction quality being heavily influenced by input view density. Performance degrades in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.To address these limitations, we reduce dependency on inter-view geometric constraints by exploiting spatial information within individual views. We propose an image-plane decoding framework with three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder, Affine Compensation Module, and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder. These modules decode three-dimensional structural information encoded in images through physical imaging processes. The framework effectively preserves spatial geometric features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures. It significantly enhances view-invariant reconstruction.Experiments on indoor scene reconstruction datasets confirm superior reconstruction stability. Our method maintains nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. It achieves a coefficient of variation of 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%, and maximum performance drop of 0.42%. These results demonstrate that exploiting intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited scenarios in practical applications.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image. However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content manipulation across frames.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels, binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image, InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method, termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes, and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved. Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability, as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized, spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations, and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes, including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning. Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks. Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of our model's outputs.

Abstract: AI-based talking-head videoconferencing systems reduce bandwidth by sending a compact pose-expression latent and re-synthesizing RGB at the receiver, but this latent can be puppeteered, letting an attacker hijack a victim's likeness in real time. Because every frame is synthetic, deepfake and synthetic video detectors fail outright. To address this security problem, we exploit a key observation: the pose-expression latent inherently contains biometric information of the driving identity. Therefore, we introduce the first biometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video: a pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent identity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and expression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit identity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple talking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms existing puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

<title>One Stone with Two Birds: A Null-Text-Null Frequency-Aware Diffusion Models for Text-Guided Image Inpainting</title>

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile, serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion models.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features. This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline, from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets. Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set, achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations. Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability. Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction. In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored. Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce VisualToolBench, a visual tool-use reasoning benchmark that rigorously evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under the think-with-images paradigm. VisualToolBench comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with images, VisualToolBench offers critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential. Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77% on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings. Reproducible codes and results are made publicly accessible at https://github.com/DeeptimaanB/ExpressNet-MoE.

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic, identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This "Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured photos.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks. These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving multi-object image generation.

Abstract: Generative models, such as GANs, learn an explicit low-dimensional representation of a particular class of images, and so they may be used as natural image priors for solving inverse problems such as image restoration and compressive sensing. GAN priors have demonstrated impressive performance on these tasks, but they can exhibit substantial representation error for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution images, because of the mismatch between the learned, approximate image distribution and the data generating distribution. In this paper, we demonstrate a method for reducing the representation error of GAN priors by modeling images as the linear combination of a GAN prior with a Deep Decoder. The deep decoder is an underparameterized and most importantly unlearned natural signal model similar to the Deep Image Prior. No knowledge of the specific inverse problem is needed in the training of the GAN underlying our method. For compressive sensing and image superresolution, our hybrid model exhibits consistently higher PSNRs than both the GAN priors and Deep Decoder separately, both on in-distribution and out-of-distribution images. This model provides a method for extensibly and cheaply leveraging both the benefits of learned and unlearned image recovery priors in inverse problems.

Abstract: Contrastive Learning first extracts features from unlabeled data, followed by linear probing with labeled data. Adversarial Contrastive Learning (ACL) integrates Adversarial Training into the first phase to enhance feature robustness against attacks in the probing phase. While ACL has shown strong empirical results, its theoretical understanding remains limited. Furthermore, while a fair amount of theoretical works analyze how the unsupervised loss can support the supervised loss in the probing phase, none has examined its role to the robust supervised loss. To fill this gap, our work develops rigorous theories to identify which components in the unsupervised training can help improve the robust supervised loss. Specifically, besides the adversarial contrastive loss, we reveal that the benign one, along with a global divergence between benign and adversarial examples can also improve robustness. Proper experiments are conducted to justify our findings.

Abstract: Recent rehearsal-free continual learning (CL) methods guided by prompts achieve strong performance on vision tasks with non-stationary data but remain resource-intensive, hindering real-world edge deployment. We introduce resource-efficient prompting (REP), which improves the computational and memory efficiency of prompt-based rehearsal-free continual learning methods while minimizing accuracy trade-offs. Our approach employs swift prompt selection to refine input data using a carefully provisioned model and introduces adaptive token merging (AToM) and adaptive layer dropping (ALD) for efficient prompt updates. AToM and ALD selectively skip data and model layers while preserving task-specific features during the learning of new tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets demonstrate REP's superior resource efficiency over state-of-the-art rehearsal-free CL methods.

Abstract: Improving connectivity and completeness are the most challenging aspects of liver vessel segmentation, especially for small vessels. These challenges require both learning the continuous vessel geometry, and focusing on small vessel detection. However, current methods do not explicitly address these two aspects and cannot generalize well when constrained by inconsistent annotations. Here, we take advantage of the generalization of the diffusion model and explicitly integrate connectivity and completeness in our diffusion-based segmentation model. Specifically, we use a graph-attention module that adds knowledge about vessel geometry, and thus adds continuity. Additionally, we perform the graph-attention at multiple-scales, thus focusing on small liver vessels. Our method outperforms eight state-of-the-art medical segmentation methods on two public datasets: 3D-ircadb-01 and LiVS. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhangXiaotong015/GATSegDiff.

Abstract: The human brain is a complex system requiring both macroscopic and microscopic components for comprehensive understanding. However, mapping nonlinear relationships between these scales remains challenging due to technical limitations and the high cost of multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisition. To address this, we introduce Macro2Micro, a deep learning framework that predicts brain microstructure from macrostructure using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Based on the hypothesis that microscale structural information can be inferred from macroscale structures, Macro2Micro explicitly encodes multiscale brain information into distinct processing branches. To enhance artifact elimination and output quality, we propose a simple yet effective auxiliary discriminator and learning objective. Extensive experiments demonstrated that Macro2Micro faithfully translates T1-weighted MRIs into corresponding Fractional Anisotropy (FA) images, achieving a 6.8\% improvement in the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) compared to previous methods, while retaining the individual biological characteristics of the brain. With an inference time of less than 0.01 seconds per MR modality translation, Macro2Micro introduces the potential for real-time multimodal rendering in medical and research applications. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Dynamic MRI reconstruction, one of inverse problems, has seen a surge by the use of deep learning techniques. Especially, the practical difficulty of obtaining ground truth data has led to the emergence of unsupervised learning approaches. A recent promising method among them is implicit neural representation (INR), which defines the data as a continuous function that maps coordinate values to the corresponding signal values. This allows for filling in missing information only with incomplete measurements and solving the inverse problem effectively. Nevertheless, previous works incorporating this method have faced drawbacks such as long optimization time and the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose Dynamic-Aware INR (DA-INR), an INR-based model for dynamic MRI reconstruction that captures the spatial and temporal continuity of dynamic MRI data in the image domain and explicitly incorporates the temporal redundancy of the data into the model structure. As a result, DA-INR outperforms other models in reconstruction quality even at extreme undersampling ratios while significantly reducing optimization time and requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Achieving high model robustness under adversarial settings is widely recognized as demanding considerable training samples. Recent works propose semi-supervised adversarial training (SSAT) methods with external unlabeled or synthetically generated data, which are the current state-of-the-art. However, SSAT requires substantial extra data to attain high robustness, resulting in prolonged training time and increased memory usage. In this paper, we propose unlabeled data reduction strategies to improve the efficiency of SSAT. Specifically, we design novel latent clustering-based techniques to select or generate a small critical subset of data samples near the model's decision boundary. While focusing on boundary-adjacent points, our methods maintain a balanced ratio between boundary and non-boundary data points to avoid overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our methods can significantly reduce SSAT's data requirement and computation costs while preserving its strong robustness advantages. In particular, our latent-space selection scheme based on k-means clustering and our guided DDPM fine-tuning approach with LCG-KM are the most effective, achieving nearly identical robust accuracies with 5x to 10x less unlabeled data and approximately 4x less total runtime.

Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is a powerful framework for unsupervised learning of structured and explainable representations that can support reasoning about objects and actions, including in surgical videos. While conventional object-centric methods for videos leverage recurrent processing to achieve efficiency, they often struggle with maintaining long-range temporal coherence required for long videos in surgical applications. On the other hand, fully parallel processing of entire videos enhances temporal consistency but introduces significant computational overhead, making it impractical for implementation on hardware in medical facilities. We present Slot-BERT, a bidirectional long-range model that learns object-centric representations in a latent space while ensuring robust temporal coherence. Slot-BERT scales object discovery seamlessly to long videos of unconstrained lengths. A novel slot contrastive loss further reduces redundancy and improves the representation disentanglement by enhancing slot orthogonality.

Abstract: The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research.

<title>Task-Oriented Feature Compression for Multimodal Understanding via Device-Edge Co-Inference</title>

Abstract: With the rapid development of large multimodal models (LMMs), multimodal understanding applications are emerging. As most LMM inference requests originate from edge devices with limited computational capabilities, the predominant inference pipeline involves directly forwarding the input data to an edge server which handles all computations. However, this approach introduces high transmission latency due to limited uplink bandwidth of edge devices and significant computation latency caused by the prohibitive number of visual tokens, thus hindering delay-sensitive tasks and degrading user experience. To address this challenge, we propose a task-oriented feature compression (TOFC) method for multimodal understanding in a device-edge co-inference framework, where visual features are merged by clustering and encoded by a learnable and selective entropy model before feature projection. Specifically, we employ density peaks clustering based on K nearest neighbors to reduce the number of visual features, thereby minimizing both data transmission and computational complexity. Subsequently, a learnable entropy model with hyperprior is utilized to encode and decode merged features, further reducing transmission overhead. To enhance compression efficiency, multiple entropy models are adaptively selected based on the characteristics of the visual features, enabling a more accurate estimation of the probability distribution. Comprehensive experiments on seven visual question answering benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFC method. Results show that TOFC achieves up to 52% reduction in data transmission overhead and 63% reduction in system latency while maintaining identical task performance, compared with neural compression ELIC.

<title>Measuring the (Un)Faithfulness of Concept-Based Explanations</title>

Abstract: Post-hoc, unsupervised concept-based explanation methods (U-CBEMs) translate a vision model's internal reasoning into human-understandable concepts, leading to interpretable explanations. However, we find that many state-of-the-art (SOTA) U-CBEMs are not faithful: their concepts seem interpretable but fail to reproduce the model's predictions. We argue that this deficiency has gone unnoticed due to fragmented evaluation - each paper proposes its own faithfulness measure, with no measure-over-measure comparison or broad benchmarking. We close this gap by (i) organizing prior metrics in a unified framework, discussing their limitations, and identifying desiderata for a faithfulness measure; (ii) introducing the Surrogate Faithfulness (SURF) measure, which quantifies faithfulness via the predictive loss of a surrogate that maps explanations to the model's outputs; and (iii) delivering the first comprehensive U-CBEM faithfulness benchmark across diverse tasks and architectures. In a controlled setting, SURF outperforms prior faithfulness measures in measure-over-measure comparisons, and applying SURF to SOTA U-CBEMs reveals that many visually appealing U-CBEMs are surprisingly unfaithful. We demonstrate SURF applicability in two downstream settings - (i) faithfulness versus the number of concepts used in the explanation and (ii) U-CBEM robustness to adversarial attacks - underscoring SURF's value as a reliable faithfulness measure. Code to be released.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding, the ability to map natural language instructions to specific actions on graphical user interfaces, remains a critical bottleneck in computer use agent development. Current benchmarks oversimplify grounding tasks as short referring expressions, failing to capture the complexity of real-world interactions that require software commonsense, layout understanding, and fine-grained manipulation capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce OSWorld-G, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 564 finely annotated samples across diverse task types including text matching, element recognition, layout understanding, and precise manipulation. Additionally, we synthesize and release the largest computer use grounding dataset Jedi, which contains 4 million examples through multi-perspective decoupling of tasks. Our multi-scale models trained on Jedi demonstrate its effectiveness by outperforming existing approaches on ScreenSpot-v2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and our OSWorld-G. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improved grounding with Jedi directly enhances agentic capabilities of general foundation models on complex computer tasks, improving from 5% to 27% on OSWorld. Through detailed ablation studies, we identify key factors contributing to grounding performance and verify that combining specialized data for different interface elements enables compositional generalization to novel interfaces. All benchmark, data, checkpoints, and code are open-sourced and available at https://osworld-grounding.github.io.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) can mitigate the causal confusion and distribution shift inherent to imitation learning (IL). However, applying RL to end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) remains an open problem for its training difficulty, and IL is still the mainstream paradigm in both academia and industry. Recently Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have demonstrated promising results in neural planning; however, these methods typically require privileged information as input rather than raw sensor data. We fill this gap by designing Raw2Drive, a dual-stream MBRL approach. Initially, we efficiently train an auxiliary privileged world model paired with a neural planner that uses privileged information as input. Subsequently, we introduce a raw sensor world model trained via our proposed Guidance Mechanism, which ensures consistency between the raw sensor world model and the privileged world model during rollouts. Finally, the raw sensor world model combines the prior knowledge embedded in the heads of the privileged world model to effectively guide the training of the raw sensor policy. Raw2Drive is so far the only RL based end-to-end method on CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, and Bench2Drive and it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<title>First SFT, Second RL, Third UPT: Continual Improving Multi-Modal LLM Reasoning via Unsupervised Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Improving Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), which require expensive and manually annotated multi-modal data--an ultimately unsustainable resource. This limitation has motivated a growing interest in unsupervised paradigms as a third stage of post-training after SFT and RL. While recent efforts have explored this direction, their methods are complex and difficult to iterate. To address this, we propose MM-UPT, a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs, enabling continual self-improvement without any external supervision. The training method of MM-UPT builds upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments demonstrate that such training method effectively improves the reasoning ability of Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3\%$\rightarrow$72.9\% on MathVista, 62.9\%$\rightarrow$68.7\% on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth labels. To further explore scalability, we extend our framework to a data self-generation setting, designing two strategies that prompt the MLLM to synthesize new training samples on its own. Additional experiments show that combining these synthetic data with the unsupervised training method can also boost performance, highlighting a promising approach for scalable self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for autonomous enhancement of MLLMs, serving as a critical third step after initial SFT and RL in the absence of external supervision.

<title>CMIE: Combining MLLM Insights with External Evidence for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection</title>

arXiv:2505.23449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

<title>Psi-Sampler: Initial Particle Sampling for SMC-Based Inference-Time Reward Alignment in Score Models</title>

arXiv:2506.01320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as demonstrated in our experiments.

<title>Are Pixel-Wise Metrics Reliable for Sparse-View Computed Tomography Reconstruction?</title>

Abstract: Widely adopted evaluation metrics for sparse-view CT reconstruction--such as Structural Similarity Index Measure and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio--prioritize pixel-wise fidelity but often fail to capture the completeness of critical anatomical structures, particularly small or thin regions that are easily missed. To address this limitation, we propose a suite of novel anatomy-aware evaluation metrics designed to assess structural completeness across anatomical structures, including large organs, small organs, intestines, and vessels. Building on these metrics, we introduce CARE, a Completeness-Aware Reconstruction Enhancement framework that incorporates structural penalties during training to encourage anatomical preservation of significant structures. CARE is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into analytical, implicit, and generative methods. When applied to these methods, CARE substantially improves structural completeness in CT reconstructions, achieving up to +32% improvement for large organs, +22% for small organs, +40% for intestines, and +36% for vessels.

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority. In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy under ambient illumination.

Abstract: We study unsupervised clustering of documents at both the category and template levels using frozen multimodal encoders and classical clustering algorithms. We systematize a model-agnostic pipeline that (i) projects heterogeneous last-layer states from text-layout-vision encoders into token-type-aware document vectors and (ii) performs clustering with centroid- or density-based methods, including an HDBSCAN + $k$-NN assignment to eliminate unlabeled points. We evaluate eight encoders (text-only, layout-aware, vision-only, and vision-language) with $k$-Means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN + $k$-NN, and BIRCH on five corpora spanning clean synthetic invoices, their heavily degraded print-and-scan counterparts, scanned receipts, and real identity and certificate documents. The study reveals modality-specific failure modes and a robustness-accuracy trade-off, with vision features nearly solving template discovery on clean pages while text dominates under covariate shift, and fused encoders offering the best balance. We detail a reproducible, oracle-free tuning protocol and the curated evaluation settings to guide future work on unsupervised document organization.

Abstract: We introduce ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset linking free-text findings to pixel-level 3D segmentations in chest CT scans. The dataset includes 3,142 non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from CT-RATE. Construction followed a structured three-stage pipeline. First, GPT-4 was used to extract and standardize findings, descriptors, and metadata from reports originally written in Turkish and machine-translated into English. Second, GPT-4o-mini categorized each finding into a hierarchical ontology of lung and pleural abnormalities. Third, 3D annotations were produced for all CT volumes: the training set was quality-assured by board-certified radiologists, and the validation and test sets were fully annotated by board-certified radiologists. Additionally, a complementary chain-of-thought dataset was created to provide step-by-step hierarchical anatomical reasoning for localizing findings within the CT volume, using GPT-4o and localization coordinates derived from organ segmentation models. ReXGroundingCT contains 16,301 annotated entities across 8,028 text-to-3D-segmentation pairs, covering diverse radiological patterns from 3,142 non-contrast CT scans. About 79% of findings are focal abnormalities and 21% are non-focal. The dataset includes a public validation set of 50 cases and a private test set of 100 cases, both annotated by board-certified radiologists. The dataset establishes a foundation for enabling free-text finding segmentation and grounded radiology report generation in CT imaging. Model performance on the private test set is hosted on a public leaderboard at https://rexrank.ai/ReXGroundingCT. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXGroundingCT.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval. These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end, we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference. To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e., Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.

arXiv:2508.16359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example, they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology, and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

arXiv:2509.15328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion. Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs \textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase, gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

Abstract: Smartphone-based iris recognition in the visible spectrum (VIS) remains difficult due to illumination variability, pigmentation differences, and the absence of standardized capture controls. This work presents a compact end-to-end pipeline that enforces ISO/IEC 29794-6 quality compliance at acquisition and demonstrates that accurate VIS iris recognition is feasible on commodity devices. Using a custom Android application performing real-time framing, sharpness evaluation, and feedback, we introduce the CUVIRIS dataset of 752 compliant images from 47 subjects. A lightweight MobileNetV3-based multi-task segmentation network (LightIrisNet) is developed for efficient on-device processing, and a transformer matcher (IrisFormer) is adapted to the VIS domain. Under a standardized protocol and comparative benchmarking against prior CNN baselines, OSIRIS attains a TAR of 97.9% at FAR=0.01 (EER=0.76%), while IrisFormer, trained only on UBIRIS.v2, achieves an EER of 0.057% on CUVIRIS. The acquisition app, trained models, and a public subset of the dataset are released to support reproducibility. These results confirm that standardized capture and VIS-adapted lightweight models enable accurate and practical iris recognition on smartphones.

Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility (e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data. Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.

<br />
Summary: In the context of training powerful image generators with adapters for personalized text-to-image synthesis, a common issue is the entanglement of target attributes with incidental factors in the input image. This problem limits generalization and adherence to the input text prompt. A solution proposed in this work is Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training, where confounding factors are separated through auxiliary modules during training to prevent the adapter from internalizing them. These auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. This approach improves generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence in tasks like facial and full-body identity injection. The study suggests that establishing shortcuts for what should not be learned can lead to more disentangled representations in large models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training, confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what should NOT be learned.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new approach called Video-As-Prompt (VAP) for semantic-controlled video generation, aiming to address the challenge of unified, generalizable semantic control. VAP leverages a reference video as a semantic prompt to guide a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) through a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This approach prevents catastrophic forgetting and eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval. The authors also introduce VAP-Data, the largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation, containing over 100K paired videos across 100 semantic conditions. VAP achieves a user preference rate of 38.7%, competing with leading condition-specific commercial models. It demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and supports various downstream applications, marking a significant advancement in general-purpose, controllable video generation. <div>

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval. To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

<div> Keywords: medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks, transformers, focal modulation, bidirectional feature fusion<br />
Summary:<br />
Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, providing vital information for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have advanced segmentation tasks, capturing global context and long-range dependencies remains a challenge due to their local operation. To address this, a novel approach is proposed - the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network (FM-BFF-Net), which combines CNNs and transformers. The network utilizes a focal modulation attention mechanism for refined context awareness and a bidirectional feature fusion module for efficient encoder-decoder representation interaction across scales. FM-BFF-Net excels in boundary precision and robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the network's superior performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and Dice coefficient. The adaptability and effectiveness of FM-BFF-Net make it a promising solution for various medical imaging scenarios.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges. To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection, skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse medical imaging scenarios.

<div> Keywords: point tracking, uncertainty, generative model, multi-modality, occlusions

Summary: 
The article introduces Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a novel generative framework for tracking points in videos. This framework addresses the limitations of current discriminative models by capturing multi-modality in point trajectories. GenPT is trained using a flow matching formulation that combines iterative refinement, window-dependent priors, and a variance schedule specific to point coordinates. During inference, GenPT leverages its generative capabilities by employing a best-first search strategy on generated samples guided by its confidence in predictions. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GenPT outperforms existing discriminative trackers in tracking accuracy, particularly on occluded points. It excels in capturing the uncertainty and appearance changes that often challenge point tracking tasks in videos, making it a promising solution for real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions. Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers, a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference, guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant discriminative point trackers.

arXiv:2510.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning" ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1) the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4) clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over 450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy, providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways, 3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<div> self-supervised learning, computer vision, adaptation, object-centric videos, VESSA<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces VESSA, a novel self-supervised adaptation method for visual foundation models that leverages multi-view object-centric videos for domain adaptation without annotations. VESSA utilizes a self-distillation paradigm and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques to prevent forgetting pretrained knowledge. By incorporating object observations from different frames in videos, VESSA learns robustness to various capture conditions. Through experiments with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA consistently outperforms base models and previous adaptation methods in downstream classification tasks. This approach addresses the challenge of distribution shifts and scarce labels in domains where supervised fine-tuning is impractical, offering a promising solution for model adaptation in computer vision tasks. The code for VESSA is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation. Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes. Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

Summary: 
ZING-3D is a new framework designed for generating structured scene representations in complex 3D environments. It utilizes pretrained foundation models to achieve open-vocabulary recognition and create a detailed semantic scene graph without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. The framework supports incremental updates as new observations are made and provides explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for robotics applications. By leveraging VLM reasoning, ZING-3D generates a rich 2D scene graph that is then grounded in 3D using depth information. Nodes in the scene graph represent objects with features, 3D locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic relationships between objects along with inter-object distances. Experimental results on Replica and HM3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ZING-3D in capturing spatial and relational knowledge without task-specific training.

arXiv:2510.21069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D, a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

Summary:
WaveSeg introduces a novel decoder architecture that optimizes feature refinement in both spatial and wavelet domains. The model first learns high-frequency components from input images to enhance boundary details. A Dual Domain Operation (DDO) mechanism is used for multi-scale fusion, along with the Spectrum Decomposition Attention (SDA) block for long-range modeling. Reparameterized convolutions are applied to preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. A residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features and boundary-aware representations to produce rich feature maps. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show that WaveSeg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and precision in semantic segmentation tasks. <div>

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically, high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

Summary: <br />
Hirschsprung's disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in parts of the colon, causing obstruction. Accurate diagnosis and treatment rely on identifying regions of the myenteric plexus on tissue slides. Traditional deep learning approaches lack interpretability for physicians. A new framework integrating textual concepts from expert sources into a vision-language model shows promise. By aligning semantic cues with visual features, the model achieved superior classification performance compared to CNN-based models like VGG-19 and ResNet. The proposed model obtained an accuracy of 83.9%, precision of 86.6%, and specificity of 87.6%. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and emphasizes the importance of incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant outputs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources (e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models, including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

HistRetinex is a novel histogram-based low-light image enhancement method that extends the Retinex model to the histogram domain. It introduces the histogram location matrix and count matrix to establish relationships among illumination, reflectance, and low-light image histograms.

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively. Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

<div> Keywords: Visual reasoning, Multimodal large language models, Active Visual Reasoning, Interactive environments, Embodied reasoning

Summary: 
The article introduces the Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, which extends visual reasoning to interactive environments where information is incomplete or occluded. Inspired by human capabilities, AVR requires agents to actively acquire information through physical actions, integrate observations across multiple steps, and adjust decisions based on visual feedback. The CLEVR-AVR benchmark and the AVR-152k dataset are introduced to evaluate reasoning correctness and information-gathering efficiency. The PhysVLM-AVR model, an MLLM, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various visual reasoning tasks. However, the analysis reveals that current embodied MLLMs struggle to actively acquire and integrate new information through interaction, indicating a gap in active reasoning capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception, reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR, embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath, Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap in active reasoning capabilities.

<title>Urban 3D Change Detection Using LiDAR Sensor for HD Map Maintenance and Smart Mobility</title>

<div> Keywords: HD maps, LiDAR, change detection, object-centric, uncertainty-aware.

Summary: 
An object-centric, uncertainty-aware pipeline for city-scale LiDAR data is proposed for high-definition mapping and change detection. The method aligns LiDAR data from different time points, normalizes height, and uses geometry proxies for cross-epoch associations. It employs semantic and instance segmentation with bipartite assignment to handle splits and merges while preserving class information. Tiled processing limits memory usage without compromising detection accuracy. Instance-level decisions are based on 3D overlap, normal direction displacement, and height and volume differences, with a histogram distance gate. The method achieves high accuracy, mF1, and mIoU on Subiaco blocks, outperforming existing approaches, with a significant improvement on detecting 'Decreased' areas. Uncertainty estimation and object-level detection calibration enhance the reliability of change detection in urban environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins, and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height, and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes. Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes, and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement, and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2% accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

<div> dynamic priors, fine-tuning paradigm, segmentation tasks, Controllable-LPMoE, object segmentation

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel fine-tuning paradigm, Controllable-LPMoE, for adapting large-scale foundation models to specific object segmentation tasks efficiently. Traditional full-parameter fine-tuning processes lead to high computational overhead due to updating numerous parameters. The proposed Controllable-LPMoE approach reduces trainable parameters by dynamically modulating frozen models with local priors, enhancing fine-grained perception for segmentation tasks. This is achieved through a dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures diverse local priors and a gating network to output expert priors for fine-tuning. Additionally, a bi-directional interaction adapter utilizing deformable attention and adaptive scale enhancement facilitates efficient interaction and restructuring between frozen and trainable features. Extensive experiments showcase the superior segmentation performance of Controllable-LPMoE compared to 31 state-of-the-art methods and its adaptability across multiple binary object segmentation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our \href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE} approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object segmentation tasks.

<div> Keywords: image safety, SafetyPairs, counterfactual pairs, vision-language models, data augmentation

Summary:
SafetyPairs is introduced as a framework for generating pairs of images that differ only in safety-relevant features, allowing for the systematic study of fine-grained image safety distinctions. By leveraging image editing models, targeted changes can be made to images to flip their safety labels while keeping safety-irrelevant details intact. A new safety benchmark, consisting of over 3,020 SafetyPair images across 9 safety categories, is constructed to evaluate the abilities of vision-language models in distinguishing subtly different images. The benchmark not only highlights weaknesses in these models but also serves as a data augmentation strategy to enhance the training efficiency of lightweight guard models. This comprehensive resource provides a systematic approach to understanding and evaluating image safety, offering valuable insights into the complexities of identifying unsafe images. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020 SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety distinctions.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Multimodal Large Language Models, NoisyGRPO, Bayesian Framework 

Summary: 
NoisyGRPO is a novel multimodal reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the general Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by introducing controllable noise into visual inputs for improved exploration and by explicitly modeling the advantage estimation process through a Bayesian framework. The framework consists of a Noise-Injected Exploration Policy, which perturbs visual inputs with Gaussian noise to encourage exploration, and a Bayesian Advantage Estimation method that formulates advantage estimation as a Bayesian inference problem. By incorporating both noise-based exploration and Bayesian advantage estimation, NoisyGRPO improves the generalization and robustness of MLLMs in various CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks, especially in settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL 3B. This approach effectively guides MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones, leading to significant performance enhancements in RL tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.21122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning, existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1) \textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones. Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

Summary:<br />
- Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is crucial for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases, but its use of iodinated contrast agents carries risks.
- A new method, Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA), generated from Non-Contrast CT scans using CycleGAN, showed superior performance in image quality and vessel enhancement.

- DCCTPA demonstrated valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity, and preservation of structures.
- Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than between NCCT and CTPA, particularly for small vessels.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on 249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics (For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE: 165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization, demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70, 0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

Summary:<br />
The article addresses the challenge of integrating and verifying spatial intelligence in foundation models. It introduces the Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG) as a structured schema to encode object layouts and relations, providing a faithful representation of scene structure. SIG-informed evaluation metrics quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, separating spatial capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with multimodal LLMs, SIG yields larger, more stable gains compared to VQA-only representations. The article also presents SIGBench, a benchmark dataset for machine VSI tasks and attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.<br /> <div>

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence (VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured, grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text, SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench, a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework that improves high-fidelity data generation. BFM partitions the generative trajectory into smaller specialized velocity blocks, increasing efficiency and sample quality. The framework incorporates a Semantic Feature Guidance module to condition velocity blocks on semantically rich features. A Feature Residual Approximation strategy is proposed to reduce inference cost while preserving semantic quality. Experiments on ImageNet 256x256 show that BFM outperforms existing Flow Matching methods, achieving accelerations in inference complexity with comparable generation performance. The code for implementing BFM is available on GitHub. <div>
arXiv:2510.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data. Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval, improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

<div> Keywords: TokenCLIP, anomaly detection, zero-shot learning, dynamic alignment, optimal transport problem

Summary:<br /><br />
TokenCLIP is a framework proposed for anomaly detection on unseen objects in a zero-shot manner. Unlike existing methods that rely on a single textual space for alignment, TokenCLIP allows for dynamic alignment between visual and textual spaces at a token-wise level. By assigning each token to a customized textual subspace based on its visual characteristics, TokenCLIP enables fine-grained anomaly learning. The framework expands the token-agnostic textual space into orthogonal subspaces and dynamically assigns tokens to subspaces guided by semantic similarity, improving efficiency and customization. This dynamic alignment is formulated as an optimal transport problem, ensuring optimization across subspaces and encouraging focus on different semantics. The resulting transport plan adaptsively assigns tokens to semantically relevant subspaces and sparsifies the plan to specialize subspaces for distinct visual regions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenCLIP in anomaly detection tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.21171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TokenCLIP.

By using graph formulation, KBE can represent static or dynamic VQA samples and incorporate multimodal knowledge for a more reliable assessment. KBE allows for the reconstruction of questions by selecting visual information and expanding questions with external textual knowledge, enabling difficulty-controllable evaluation through question exploration.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially, KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge. It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.

<div> Guidance, Frequency Bias, Self-Consistency, Curvy Flow Trajectories, iSM <br />
Summary: <br />
Shortcut models offer a new approach to generative modeling but have faced performance issues. This paper addresses five key challenges limiting the adoption of shortcut models. Firstly, compounding guidance flaws causing image artifacts are tackled. Secondly, inflexible fixed guidance is resolved with Intrinsic Guidance providing dynamic control. Thirdly, Frequency Bias is mitigated with a Multi-Level Wavelet Loss to restore high-frequency details. Fourthly, divergent self-consistency is addressed through a Twin EMA strategy. Finally, curvy flow trajectories hindering convergence are tackled using Scaling Optimal Transport (sOT). The proposed iSM framework includes these key improvements, resulting in substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut models on ImageNet 256 x 256, making shortcut models a competitive option for generative modeling. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts; (2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4) divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5) curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges, we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

<div> Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner, 3D meshes, Discrete Diffusion Models, parallel generation <br />
Summary: <br />
Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR) is introduced as a method for generating high-quality 3D artist-style meshes based on Discrete Diffusion Models (DDMs). TSSR enables parallel generation by allowing all mesh tokens to be seen concurrently, enhancing efficiency and control. Three key innovations are implemented: Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which separates generation into topology sculpting and shape refinement stages; an Improved Hourglass Architecture with bidirectional attention and Rotational Positional Embeddings for richer contextual information; and a Connection Loss for topological constraint. TSSR produces high-quality 3D meshes with up to 10,000 faces at a spatial resolution of $1024^3, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on complex datasets. The code for TSSR will be available at the provided GitHub link. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1) Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes, capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of $1024^3$. The code will be released at: https://github.com/psky1111/Tencent-TSSR.

<br />Summary: SAGE-3D introduces a new paradigm called Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments for 3D Navigation, enhancing 3D Gaussian Splatting for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). By adding fine-grained object annotations and physics-aware execution jointing, SAGE-3D improves the realism and executability of 3DGS scenes. The InteriorGS dataset offers 1K object-annotated indoor scenes, while the SAGE-Bench benchmark provides 2M VLN data for evaluation. Experiment results show that 3DGS data is challenging yet offers strong generalizability, boosting performance by 31% on the VLN-CE Unseen task. Access to the data and code will be available soon. <br /> <div>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this, we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable, semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components: (1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data. Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Summary:<br /><br />The article introduces \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement learning framework for segmenting extremely small objects in high-resolution images. The framework consists of Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual Refinement (LPR) stages for precise object localization. A locate-informed retrospective reward couples the stages for more robust exploration. Additionally, a new dataset \textsc{FineRS}-4k is presented for evaluating MLLMs on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. % Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle, small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on \textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

<div> - Keywords: vision-language models, interpretability, alignment, sparse autoencoder, multi-modal representations

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces VL-SAE, a sparse autoencoder that enhances the interpretability of vision-language representations in current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By mapping representations into a unified concept set, VL-SAE correlates each hidden neuron to a specific concept represented by similar images and texts. This alignment is achieved through explicit cosine similarity-based alignment and consistent neuron activations during training. VL-SAE outperforms existing VLMs like CLIP and LLaVA in both interpretation and enhancement of vision-language alignment. The interpretability aspect allows for understanding representation semantics through concepts, while the enhancement aspect strengthens alignment at the concept level. This leads to improved performance in tasks like zero-shot image classification and reducing hallucinations. The code for VL-SAE is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities. However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training. First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second, we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA) demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination.

Summary:<br />
- The article introduces FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced changes in three-dimensional cellular structure.
- FORM consists of a morphology encoder and a diffusion-based perturbation trajectory module, trained on a large-scale dataset of 3D cell volumes.
- It supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and conditional simulation of perturbed cell states, as well as predicting downstream signalling activity and simulating combinatorial perturbation effects.
- An evaluation benchmarking suite, MorphoEval, quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural, statistical, and biological dimensions.

arXiv:2510.21337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000 multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural, statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology, perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions, poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions. Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12% on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural applications.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate localization information from the template. The limitation results in suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/zxyyxzz/DSATrack.

Summary:
This work introduces a gaze-regularized framework to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for egocentric understanding tasks. By incorporating human gaze during training, a gaze-regularized attention mechanism aligns model focus with visual gaze, improving semantic prediction scores for future event prediction and current activity understanding. Compared to baseline models trained without gaze regularization, the proposed approach achieves up to 11 improvement in future event prediction and around 7 improvement in current activity understanding. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using human gaze to enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world applications such as assistive robots and human-machine collaboration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular, allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like assistive robots and human-machine collaboration.

Summary: 
The study presented a unified pipeline for generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI and CBCT images using a 2.5D U-Net++ model with a ResNet-34 encoder. The model was trained on normalized, body-masked inputs with a combination of pixel-wise L1 loss and perceptual losses. Training utilized patch-based inputs with random flipping and no post-processing. Test-time augmentation and five-fold ensembling were used for final predictions. The study compared two registration strategies, Elastix and IMPACT, finding that IMPACT-based registration resulted in more accurate and anatomically consistent alignments and improved sCT synthesis on local test sets. However, models trained with Elastix-aligned data performed better on the public validation set due to a registration bias in the evaluation pipeline. The study highlighted the importance of anatomically consistent alignment in sCT synthesis models to mitigate bias and improve overall performance and anatomical fidelity. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder, trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256 for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information, consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures. On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment, IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and generalizable sCT synthesis models.

In this work, a novel framework is proposed to enhance the generation quality of diffusion models based on real-time network bandwidth constraints. Traditional diffusion models typically produce high-fidelity images without consideration for downstream transmission limitations, resulting in wasted computation and loss of fine textures during heavy compression. The proposed approach introduces a joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model adjusts its denoising process according to the available bandwidth, enabling early-stop sampling to maintain visual quality appropriate for the transmission condition. By incorporating a lightweight quality embedding, the model learns to modulate the denoising trajectory efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in visual fidelity compared to naive early-stopping, promising efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios, limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments.

TerraGen is a unified layout-to-image generation framework designed to address the challenges of generating remote sensing imagery for various vision tasks. It introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder, multi-scale injection scheme, and mask-weighted loss to encode spatial constraints and details. A large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset is constructed to evaluate TerraGen, showing superior image quality across tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple, interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction. Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

This paper presents a novel depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method to address ghosting and misalignment issues caused by large parallax in multi-perspective image synthesis. The proposed method utilizes a multi-stage mechanism with global depth regularization constraints for accurate alignment across different depth ranges. An optimal stitching seam is determined through graph-based computation, and a soft-seam region is diffused to locate transition areas precisely, ensuring natural and seamless stitching results.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in the stitched results. To address this, we propose a depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos, tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance) and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3) Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base, Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and reranking.

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods.

Summary: 
The paper introduces ArtiLatent, a generative framework for synthesizing human-made 3D objects with detailed geometry and realistic appearance. It uses a variational autoencoder to model part geometry and articulation dynamics, embedding them into a unified latent space. A latent diffusion model allows for diverse and physically plausible sampling. An articulation-aware Gaussian decoder reconstructs photorealistic 3D shapes by considering articulation-dependent visibility changes. This method improves visual realism by assigning texture features to occluded regions based on articulation state. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArtiLatent achieves superior results in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity compared to existing approaches. This framework offers a scalable solution for creating and manipulating articulated 3D objects.

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and manipulation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the utilization of table look-up for implementing image restoration CNNs, aiming to achieve competitive image quality with enhanced speed and resource efficiency. The main challenge lies in effectively managing the table size without restricting the receptive field. Current strategies involve reusing tables for small pixel patches of various orientations and fusing the results through average pooling, which is not ideal for anisotropic signal structures. The study explores anisotropic pooling methods as an alternative to average pooling, introducing generalized median pooling and data-dependent pooling coefficients for adaptively weighing contributions from different orientations. Experimental results on various restoration benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed anisotropic pooling strategy significantly improves the performance of existing LUT-realizable CNN methods, yielding perceptually and numerically superior results. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.21437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First, we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Summary: <br />
Modeling hierarchical structures in 3D objects and scenes is crucial for autonomous agents. Existing methods struggle with implicit representations due to increased inference time or poor generalization with predefined hierarchies. To address this, OpenHype introduces a novel approach using a continuous hyperbolic latent space. Leveraging hyperbolic geometry, it encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies. OpenHype outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, showcasing superior efficiency and adaptability in 3D scene understanding. <div>

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data, especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties. To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin, synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art method, i.e., PhysTwin.

<div> Keywords: Video Anomaly Detection, Online VAD, Large Language Models, Memory-based scoring queue, Training-free

Summary:  
MoniTor is a novel online Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for real-time anomaly detection. The system utilizes a Memory-based scoring queue to process streaming input efficiently and incorporate a prediction mechanism inspired by LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies. By dynamically storing recent scores and incorporating an anomaly prior, MoniTor effectively distinguishes between normal and abnormal behaviors in surveillance videos. Evaluation on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets shows that MoniTor outperforms existing methods and achieves competitive performance without the need for explicit training. The code for MoniTor is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.  <div>
arXiv:2510.21449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame. Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available at https://github.com/YsTvT/MoniTor.

<div> image-to-video priors, temporal consistency, video inpainting, spatial coherence, motion stability

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called VidSplice for video inpainting. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by decoupling the inpainting process into multi-frame consistent image inpainting and masked area motion propagation. This approach uses spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with spatiotemporal cues. The framework includes a CoSpliced Module for first-frame propagation and a context controller module for encoding coherent priors and controlling content distortion. VidSplice improves spatial coherence, foreground alignment, and motion stability, outperforming existing approaches in diverse video inpainting scenarios. The framework effectively controls content distortion during generation, resulting in more stable and coherent inpainted videos. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the competitive performance of VidSplice across various scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2510.21461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism. Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover, its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion stability, outperforming existing approaches.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces CXR-LanIC, a framework for interpretability in deep learning models for chest X-ray diagnosis. The framework uses transcoder-based sparse autoencoders to extract interpretable visual patterns from medical image representations. By training on multimodal embeddings from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, the framework discovers approximately 5,000 monosemantic patterns related to cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact categories. Each pattern shows consistent activation behavior across images with similar radiological features, allowing for transparent attributions in predictions. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on key findings and lays the foundation for natural language explanations. Notably, the framework extracts features from a classifier trained on specific diagnostic objectives, ensuring relevance to clinical decision-making. This approach demonstrates that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable, supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded explanations. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent, verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings, ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making, demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable, supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded explanations.

Summary:
Accurate interpretation of histopathological images requires integration of information across different scales, from cellular textures to overall tissue organization. Current pathology models lack cell-level feature modeling, hindering fine-grained tasks like cancer subtype classification. To address this limitation, a dual-stream architecture is proposed to capture the interplay between tissue features and cellular representations. A receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model efficiently aggregates information from large cell sets, while a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module enables mutual attention between cellular cues and the surrounding tissue environment. Experimental results on four subtype classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models, highlighting the importance of cell-level aggregation and tissue-cell interaction in computational pathology.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns. Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method, ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly available.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety. Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience, leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n), based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a 13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding significant clinical application value.

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA, and OCR understanding.

<title>Towards a Golden Classifier-Free Guidance Path via Foresight Fixed Point Iterations</title>

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance (FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of adaptive design.

<title>Head Pursuit: Probing Attention Specialization in Multimodal Transformers</title>

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes. Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation, as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning. Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing large-scale generative models.

<title>Foley Control: Aligning a Frozen Latent Text-to-Audio Model to Video</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21581</link>

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio modalities (e.g., speech).

<title>Sample By Step, Optimize By Chunk: Chunk-Level GRPO For Text-to-Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21583</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

<title>MATrack: Efficient Multiscale Adaptive Tracker for Real-Time Nighttime UAV Operations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21586</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities, but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties, researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and 4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS. Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability, demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search and rescue and border patrol.

<title>Restore Text First, Enhance Image Later: Two-Stage Scene Text Image Super-Resolution with Glyph Structure Guidance</title>

arXiv:2510.21590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER} (\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm. \textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement: it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}). Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving overall image quality.

<title>Automated interictal epileptic spike detection from simple and noisy annotations in MEG data</title>

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

arXiv:2510.21605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000 high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities. However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

<title>DAP-MAE: Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder for Effective Cross-Domain Learning</title>

arXiv:2510.21635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE) pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE), an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks, reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial expression recognition on Bosphorus.

<title>A Dynamic Knowledge Distillation Method Based on the Gompertz Curve</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework, Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation. Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human motion capture in the wild.

arXiv:2510.21657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1 accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51% baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion, motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss), demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for 'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse structure.

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models, UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate, false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability. This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in slide-level representation learning.

arXiv:2510.21682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world -- large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance. Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation. Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset, WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world models.

arXiv:2510.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping (HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii) faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box" predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation monitoring.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images. Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training, offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without relying on reference images or additional training.

<title>Visual Diffusion Models are Geometric Solvers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one. The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving. Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object detector.

Abstract: Developing embodied AI agents requires scalable training environments that balance content diversity with physics accuracy. World simulators provide such environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning, while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images, addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials. These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation for advancing physics-based world simulators. Seed3D 1.0 is now available on https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/experience/vision?modelId=doubao-seed3d-1-0-250928&amp;tab=Gen3D

Abstract: The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy. Even trained neurologists find detecting IEDs difficult, leading many practitioners to turn to machine learning for help. While existing machine learning algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over existing approaches.

Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) represents a critical diagnostic challenge, with approximately 64,000 TBI-related deaths annually in the United States. Current diagnostic modalities including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have significant limitations: high cost, limited availability, and infrastructure dependence, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This study investigates machine learning approaches for automated ICH detection using Ultrasound Tissue Pulsatility Imaging (TPI), a portable technique measuring tissue displacement from hemodynamic forces during cardiac cycles. We analyze ultrasound TPI signals comprising 30 temporal frames per cardiac cycle with recording angle information, collected from TBI patients with CT-confirmed ground truth labels. Our preprocessing pipeline employs z-score normalization and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, retaining components explaining 95% of cumulative variance. We systematically evaluate multiple classification algorithms spanning probabilistic, kernel-based, neural network, and ensemble learning approaches across three feature representations: original 31-dimensional space, reduced subset, and PCA-transformed space. Results demonstrate that PCA transformation substantially improves classifier performance, with ensemble methods achieving 98.0% accuracy and F1-score of 0.890, effectively balancing precision and recall despite class imbalance. These findings establish the feasibility of machine learning-based ICH detection in TBI patients using portable ultrasound devices, with applications in emergency medicine, rural healthcare, and military settings where traditional imaging is unavailable.

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: Computer-aided detection systems for chest radiographs are widely used, and concurrent reader displays, such as bounding-box (BB) highlights, may influence the reading process. This pilot study used eye tracking to conduct a preliminary experiment to quantify which aspects of visual search were affected. Materials and Methods: We sampled 180 chest radiographs from the VinDR-CXR dataset: 120 with solitary pulmonary nodules or masses and 60 without. The BBs were configured to yield an overall display sensitivity and specificity of 80%. Three radiologists (with 11, 5, and 1 years of experience, respectively) interpreted each case twice - once with BBs visible and once without - after a washout of >= 2 weeks. Eye movements were recorded using an EyeTech VT3 Mini. Metrics included interpretation time, time to first fixation on the lesion, lesion dwell time, total gaze-path length, and lung-field coverage ratio. Outcomes were modeled using a linear mixed model, with reading condition as a fixed effect and case and reader as random intercepts. The primary analysis was restricted to true positives (n=96). Results: Concurrent BB display prolonged interpretation time by 4.9 s (p<0.001) and increased lesion dwell time by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Total gaze-path length increased by 2,076 pixels (p<0.001), and lung-field coverage ratio increased by 10.5% (p<0.001). Time to first fixation on the lesion was reduced by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Conclusion: Eye tracking captured measurable alterations in search behavior associated with concurrent BB displays during chest radiograph interpretation. These findings support the feasibility of this approach and highlight the need for larger studies to confirm effects and explore implications across modalities and clinical contexts.

Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerabilities of autonomous navigation and landing systems in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Specifically, it focuses on Trojan attacks that target deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Trojan attacks work by embedding covert triggers within a model's training data. These triggers cause specific failures under certain conditions, while the model continues to perform normally in other situations. We assessed the vulnerability of Urban Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAAVs) using the DroNet framework. Our experiments showed a significant drop in accuracy, from 96.4% on clean data to 73.3% on data triggered by Trojan attacks. To conduct this study, we collected a custom dataset and trained models to simulate real-world conditions. We also developed an evaluation framework designed to identify Trojan-infected models. This work demonstrates the potential security risks posed by Trojan attacks and lays the groundwork for future research on enhancing the resilience of UAM systems.

<title>More Than Memory Savings: Zeroth-Order Optimization Mitigates Forgetting in Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning (CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge, particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Abstract: Meningiomas represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors, comprising nearly one-third of all diagnosed cases. Accurate delineation of these tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet remains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of meningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency. Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets, demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context prefilling, confirming its practical viability.

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain adaptation scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/hyeongyu-kim/Buffer_TTA.

Abstract: Kinetic modeling enables \textit{in vivo} quantification of tracer uptake and glucose metabolism in [${}^{18}$F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([${}^{18}$F]FDG) dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) imaging of mice. However, kinetic modeling requires the accurate determination of the arterial input function (AIF) during imaging, which is time-consuming and invasive. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of using deep learning to directly predict the input function, surpassing established methods such as the image-derived input function (IDIF). In this work, we trained a physics-informed deep learning-based input function prediction model (PIDLIF) to estimate the AIF directly from the PET images, incorporating a kinetic modeling loss during training. The proposed method uses a two-tissue compartment model over two regions, the myocardium and brain of the mice, and is trained on a dataset of 70 [${}^{18}$F]FDG dPET images of mice accompanied by the measured AIF during imaging. The proposed method had comparable performance to the network without a physics-informed loss, and when sudden movement causing blurring in the images was simulated, the PIDLIF model maintained high performance in severe cases of image degradation. The proposed physics-informed method exhibits an improved robustness that is promoted by physically constraining the problem, enforcing consistency for out-of-distribution samples. In conclusion, the PIDLIF model offers insight into the effects of leveraging physiological distribution mechanics in mice to guide a deep learning-based AIF prediction network in images with severe degradation as a result of blurring due to movement during imaging.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen (https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias, a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global style and objects.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition (HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and, in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased. Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities.

Abstract: Free space ground segmentation is essential to navigate robots and autonomous vehicles, recognize drivable zones, and traverse efficiently. Fine-grained features remain challenging for existing segmentation models, particularly for robots in indoor and structured environments. These difficulties arise from ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement (AURASeg), a ground-plane semantic segmentation model that maintains high segmentation accuracy while improving border precision. Our method uses CSP-Darknet backbone by adding a Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for accurate edge delineation and an Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder (APUD) for strong feature integration. We also incorporate a lightweight Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) module to ensure multi-scale context extraction without compromising real-time performance. The proposed model beats benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 metrics when tested on the Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) Dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor dataset. Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to state-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise border refinement with minimal effect on inference speed.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion. We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data. We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) relies on the powerful LLM to perform multimodal tasks, showing amazing emergent abilities in recent studies, such as writing poems based on an image. However, it is difficult for these case studies to fully reflect the performance of MLLM, lacking a comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we fill in this blank, presenting the first comprehensive MLLM Evaluation benchmark MME. It measures both perception and cognition abilities on a total of 14 subtasks. In order to avoid data leakage that may arise from direct use of public datasets for evaluation, the annotations of instruction-answer pairs are all manually designed. The concise instruction design allows us to fairly compare MLLMs, instead of struggling in prompt engineering. Besides, with such an instruction, we can also easily carry out quantitative statistics. A total of 30 advanced MLLMs are comprehensively evaluated on our MME, which not only suggests that existing MLLMs still have a large room for improvement, but also reveals the potential directions for the subsequent model optimization. The data are released at the project page https://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Models/tree/Evaluation.

Abstract: Multispectral pedestrian detection achieves better visibility in challenging conditions and thus is essential to autonomous driving, for which both the accuracy and computational cost are of paramount importance. Most existing approaches treat RGB and infrared modalities equally. They typically adopt two symmetrical backbones for multimodal feature extraction, which ignore the substantial differences between modalities and bring great difficulty for the reduction of the computational cost as well as effective crossmodal fusion. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient framework named Wavelet-context Cooperative Network (WCCNet) that is able to differentially extract complementary features of different spectra with lower computational complexity, and further fuse these diverse features based on their spatially relevant crossmodal semantics. In particular, WCCNet simultaneously explore wavelet context and RGB textures within a cooperative dual-stream backbone, which is composed of adaptive discrete wavelet transform (ADWT) layers and heavyweight neural layers. The ADWT layers extract frequency components for infrared modality, while neural layers handle RGB modality features. Since ADWT layers are lightweight and extract complementary features, this cooperative structure not only significantly reduces the computational complexity, but also facilitates the subsequent crossmodal fusion. To further fuse these infrared and RGB features with significant semantic differences, we elaborately design the crossmodal rearranging fusion module (CMRF), which can mitigate spatial misalignment and merge semantically complementary features in spatially-related local regions to amplify the crossmodal reciprocal information. Experimental results on KAIST and FLIR benchmarks indicate that WCCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods with considerable efficiency and competitive accuracy.

<title>Circle Representation for Medical Instance Object Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Recently, circle representation has been introduced for medical imaging, designed specifically to enhance the detection of instance objects that are spherically shaped (e.g., cells, glomeruli, and nuclei). Given its outstanding effectiveness in instance detection, it is compelling to consider the application of circle representation for segmenting instance medical objects. In this study, we introduce CircleSnake, a simple end-to-end segmentation approach that utilizes circle contour deformation for segmenting ball-shaped medical objects at the instance level. The innovation of CircleSnake lies in these three areas: (1) It substitutes the complex bounding box-to-octagon contour transformation with a more consistent and rotation-invariant bounding circle-to-circle contour adaptation. This adaptation specifically targets ball-shaped medical objects. (2) The circle representation employed in CircleSnake significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to two, compared to eight in the octagon representation. This reduction enhances both the robustness of the segmentation performance and the rotational consistency of the method. (3) CircleSnake is the first end-to-end deep instance segmentation pipeline to incorporate circle representation, encompassing consistent circle detection, circle contour proposal, and circular convolution in a unified framework. This integration is achieved through the novel application of circular graph convolution within the context of circle detection and instance segmentation. In practical applications, such as the detection of glomeruli, nuclei, and eosinophils in pathological images, CircleSnake has demonstrated superior performance and greater rotation invariance when compared to benchmarks. The code has been made publicly available: https://github.com/hrlblab/CircleSnake.

Abstract: The field of face recognition (FR) has undergone significant advancements with the rise of deep learning. Recently, the success of unsupervised learning and graph neural networks has demonstrated the effectiveness of data structure information. Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space. As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space. To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE. Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model. To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples. Experimental results on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopoFR over the state-of-the-art methods. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/modelscope/facechain/tree/main/face_module/TopoFR.

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification. Those works test how much a trained DNN relies on specific image cues like texture. The present study shifts the focus to understanding the cue influence during training, analyzing what DNNs can learn from shape, texture, and color cues in absence of the others; investigating their individual and combined influence on the learning success. We analyze these cue influences at multiple levels by decomposing datasets into cue-specific versions. Addressing semantic segmentation, we learn the given task from these reduced cue datasets, creating cue experts. Early fusion of cues is performed by constructing appropriate datasets. This is complemented by a late fusion of experts which allows us to study cue influence location-dependent on pixel level. Experiments on Cityscapes, PASCAL Context, and a synthetic CARLA dataset show that while no single cue dominates, the shape + color expert predominantly improves the prediction of small objects and border pixels. The cue performance order is consistent for the tested convolutional and transformer architecture, indicating similar cue extraction capabilities, although pre-trained transformers are said to be more biased towards shape than convolutional neural networks.

Abstract: Point cloud synthesis, i.e. the generation of novel point clouds from an input distribution, remains a challenging task, for which numerous complex machine learning models have been devised. We develop a novel method that encodes geometrical-topological characteristics of point clouds using inner products, leading to a highly-efficient point cloud representation with provable expressivity properties. Integrated into deep learning models, our encoding exhibits high quality in typical tasks like reconstruction, generation, and interpolation, with inference times orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Abstract: We present InfiniDreamer, a novel framework for arbitrarily long human motion generation. InfiniDreamer addresses the limitations of current motion generation methods, which are typically restricted to short sequences due to the lack of long motion training data. To achieve this, we first generate sub-motions corresponding to each textual description and then assemble them into a coarse, extended sequence using randomly initialized transition segments. We then introduce an optimization-based method called Segment Score Distillation (SSD) to refine the entire long motion sequence. SSD is designed to utilize an existing motion prior, which is trained only on short clips, in a training-free manner. Specifically, SSD iteratively refines overlapping short segments sampled from the coarsely extended long motion sequence, progressively aligning them with the pre-trained motion diffusion prior. This process ensures local coherence within each segment, while the refined transitions between segments maintain global consistency across the entire sequence. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the superiority of our framework, showcasing its ability to generate coherent, contextually aware motion sequences of arbitrary length.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promising potential for parameter-efficient scaling across domains. However, their application to image classification remains limited, often requiring billion-scale datasets to be competitive. In this work, we explore the integration of MoE layers into image classification architectures using open datasets. We conduct a systematic analysis across different MoE configurations and model scales. We find that moderate parameter activation per sample provides the best trade-off between performance and efficiency. However, as the number of activated parameters increases, the benefits of MoE diminish. Our analysis yields several practical insights for vision MoE design. First, MoE layers most effectively strengthen tiny and mid-sized models, while gains taper off for large-capacity networks and do not redefine state-of-the-art ImageNet performance. Second, a Last-2 placement heuristic offers the most robust cross-architecture choice, with Every-2 slightly better for Vision Transform (ViT), and both remaining effective as data and model scale increase. Third, larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-21k) allow more experts, up to 16, for ConvNeXt to be utilized effectively without changing placement, as increased data reduces overfitting and promotes broader expert specialization. Finally, a simple linear router performs best, suggesting that additional routing complexity yields no consistent benefit.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal training have significantly improved the integration of image understanding and generation within a unified model. This study investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understanding tasks, focusing on how visual information is processed and transferred to the textual domain. We compare native multimodal VLMs, models trained from scratch on multimodal data to generate both text and images, and non-native multimodal VLMs, models adapted from pre-trained large language models or capable of generating only text, highlighting key differences in information flow. We find that in native multimodal VLMs, image and text embeddings are more separated within the residual stream. Moreover, VLMs differ in how visual information reaches text: non-native multimodal VLMs exhibit a distributed communication pattern, where information is exchanged through multiple image tokens, whereas models trained natively for joint image and text generation tend to rely on a single post-image token that acts as a narrow gate for visual information. We show that ablating this single token significantly deteriorates image-understanding performance, whereas targeted, token-level interventions reliably steer image semantics and downstream text with fine-grained control.

<title>DynamicPAE: Generating Scene-Aware Physical Adversarial Examples in Real-Time</title>

Abstract: Physical adversarial examples (PAEs) are regarded as whistle-blowers of real-world risks in deep-learning applications, thus worth further investigation. However, current PAE generation studies show limited adaptive attacking ability to diverse and varying scenes, revealing the urgent requirement of dynamic PAEs that are generated in real time and conditioned on the observation from the attacker. The key challenge in generating dynamic PAEs is learning the sparse relation between PAEs and the observation of attackers under the noisy feedback of attack training. To address the challenge, we present DynamicPAE, the first generative framework that enables scene-aware real-time physical attacks. Specifically, to address the noisy feedback problem that obfuscates the exploration of scene-related PAEs, we introduce the residual-guided adversarial pattern exploration technique. Residual-guided training, which relaxes the attack training with a reconstruction task, is proposed to enrich the feedback information, thereby achieving a more comprehensive exploration of PAEs. To address the alignment problem between the trained generator and the real-world scenario, we introduce the distribution-matched attack scenario alignment, consisting of the conditional-uncertainty-aligned data module and the skewness-aligned objective re-weighting module. The former aligns the training environment with the incomplete observation of the real-world attacker. The latter facilitates consistent stealth control across different attack targets with the skewness controller. Extensive digital and physical evaluations demonstrate the superior attack performance of DynamicPAE, attaining a 2.07 $\times$ boost (58.8% average AP drop under attack) on representative object detectors (e.g., DETR) over state-of-the-art static PAE generating methods. Overall, our work opens the door to end-to-end modeling of dynamic PAEs.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in text and image generation but suffer from slow generation due to the token-by-token process. We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to generate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would significantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice that existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple tokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the conditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for few-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which uses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network to distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the training data of the original AR model, making it more practical. We evaluate DD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on ImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step generation (6.3$\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19 to 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an 217.8$\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In both cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID>100. DD also excels on text-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for LlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to demonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD challenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens up new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that exhibit transferability across various models. Numerous approaches are proposed to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples, including advanced optimization, data augmentation, and model modifications. However, these methods still show limited transferability, particularly in cross-architecture scenarios, such as from CNN to ViT. To achieve high transferability, we propose a technique termed Spatial Adversarial Alignment (SAA), which employs an alignment loss and leverages a witness model to fine-tune the surrogate model. Specifically, SAA consists of two key parts: spatial-aware alignment and adversarial-aware alignment. First, we minimize the divergences of features between the two models in both global and local regions, facilitating spatial alignment. Second, we introduce a self-adversarial strategy that leverages adversarial examples to impose further constraints, aligning features from an adversarial perspective. Through this alignment, the surrogate model is trained to concentrate on the common features extracted by the witness model. This facilitates adversarial attacks on these shared features, thereby yielding perturbations that exhibit enhanced transferability. Extensive experiments on various architectures on ImageNet show that aligned surrogate models based on SAA can provide higher transferable adversarial examples, especially in cross-architecture attacks.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have typically focused on integrating visual and textual modalities, with less emphasis placed on the role of speech in enhancing interaction. However, speech plays a crucial role in multimodal dialogue systems, and implementing high-performance in both vision and speech tasks remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental modality differences. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed multi-stage training methodology that progressively trains LLM to understand both visual and speech information, ultimately enabling fluent vision and speech interaction. Our approach not only preserves strong vision-language capacity, but also enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities without separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodal end-to-end response speed. By comparing our method against state-of-the-art counterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, we demonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speech capabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA), which aims at automatic and fair evaluation of athletic performance, has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, athletes are often in rapid movement and the corresponding visual appearance variances are subtle, making it challenging to capture fine-grained pose differences and leading to poor estimation performance. Furthermore, most common AQA tasks, such as diving in sports, are usually divided into multiple sub-actions, each of which contains different durations. However, existing methods focus on segmenting the video into fixed frames, which disrupts the temporal continuity of sub-actions resulting in unavoidable prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel action quality assessment method through hierarchically pose-guided multi-stage contrastive regression. Firstly, we introduce a multi-scale dynamic visual-skeleton encoder to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal visual and skeletal features. Then, a procedure segmentation network is introduced to separate different sub-actions and obtain segmented features. Afterwards, the segmented visual and skeletal features are both fed into a multi-modal fusion module as physics structural priors, to guide the model in learning refined activity similarities and variances. Finally, a multi-stage contrastive learning regression approach is employed to learn discriminative representations and output prediction results. In addition, we introduce a newly-annotated FineDiving-Pose Dataset to improve the current low-quality human pose labels. In experiments, the results on FineDiving and MTL-AQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach. Our source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Lumos0507/HP-MCoRe.

Abstract: We present RigAnything, a novel autoregressive transformer-based model, which makes 3D assets rig-ready by probabilistically generating joints and skeleton topologies and assigning skinning weights in a template-free manner. Unlike most existing auto-rigging methods, which rely on predefined skeleton templates and are limited to specific categories like humanoid, RigAnything approaches the rigging problem in an autoregressive manner, iteratively predicting the next joint based on the global input shape and the previous prediction. While autoregressive models are typically used to generate sequential data, RigAnything extends its application to effectively learn and represent skeletons, which are inherently tree structures. To achieve this, we organize the joints in a breadth-first search (BFS) order, enabling the skeleton to be defined as a sequence of 3D locations and the parent index. Furthermore, our model improves the accuracy of position prediction by leveraging diffusion modeling, ensuring precise and consistent placement of joints within the hierarchy. This formulation allows the autoregressive model to efficiently capture both spatial and hierarchical relationships within the skeleton. Trained end-to-end on both RigNet and Objaverse datasets, RigAnything demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse object types, including humanoids, quadrupeds, marine creatures, insects, and many more, surpassing prior methods in quality, robustness, generalizability, and efficiency. It achieves significantly faster performance than existing auto-rigging methods, completing rigging in under a few seconds per shape.

Abstract: Visual generative and understanding models typically rely on distinct tokenizers to process images, presenting a key challenge for unifying them within a single framework. Recent studies attempt to address this by connecting the training of VQVAE (for autoregressive generation) and CLIP (for understanding) to build a unified tokenizer. However, directly combining these training objectives has been observed to cause severe loss conflicts. In this paper, we show that reconstruction and semantic supervision do not inherently conflict. Instead, the underlying bottleneck stems from limited representational capacity of discrete token space. Building on these insights, we introduce UniTok, a unified tokenizer featuring a novel multi-codebook quantization mechanism that effectively scales up the vocabulary size and bottleneck dimension. In terms of final performance, UniTok sets a new record of 0.38 rFID and 78.6% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet. Besides, UniTok can be seamlessly integrated into MLLMs to unlock native visual generation capability, without compromising the understanding performance. Additionally, we show that UniTok favors cfg-free generation, reducing gFID from 14.6 to 2.5 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 benchmark. GitHub: https://github.com/FoundationVision/UniTok.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on large-scale datasets in machine learning poses significant privacy and ethical challenges, particularly in sensitive domains such as face recognition. Synthetic data generation offers a promising alternative; however, most existing methods depend heavily on external datasets or pre-trained models, increasing complexity and resource demands. In this paper, we introduce AugGen, a self-contained synthetic augmentation technique. AugGen strategically samples from a class-conditional generative model trained exclusively on the target FR dataset, eliminating the need for external resources. Evaluated across 8 FR benchmarks, including IJB-C and IJB-B, our method achieves 1-12% performance improvements, outperforming models trained solely on real data and surpassing state-of-the-art synthetic data generation approaches, while using less real data. Notably, these gains often exceed those from architectural enhancements, underscoring the value of synthetic augmentation in data-limited scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that carefully integrated synthetic data can both mitigate privacy constraints and substantially enhance recognition performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing object detection (RSOD) often suffers from degradations such as low spatial resolution, sensor noise, motion blur, and adverse illumination. These factors diminish feature distinctiveness, leading to ambiguous object representations and inadequate foreground-background separation. Existing RSOD methods exhibit limitations in robust detection of low-quality objects. To address these pressing challenges, we introduce LEGNet, a lightweight backbone network featuring a novel Edge-Gaussian Aggregation (EGA) module specifically engineered to enhance feature representation derived from low-quality remote sensing images. EGA module integrates: (a) orientation-aware Scharr filters to sharpen crucial edge details often lost in low-contrast or blurred objects, and (b) Gaussian-prior-based feature refinement to suppress noise and regularize ambiguous feature responses, enhancing foreground saliency under challenging conditions. EGA module alleviates prevalent problems in reduced contrast, structural discontinuities, and ambiguous feature responses prevalent in degraded images, effectively improving model robustness while maintaining computational efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across five benchmarks (DOTA-v1.0, v1.5, DIOR-R, FAIR1M-v1.0, and VisDrone2019) demonstrate that LEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in detecting low-quality objects.The code is available at https://github.com/AeroVILab-AHU/LEGNet.

Abstract: Rapid evolution of territories due to climate change and human impact requires prompt and effective updates to geospatial databases maintained by the National Mapping Agency. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of change detection methods tailored for the operational updating of large-scale geographic databases. This review first outlines the fundamental definition of change, emphasizing its multifaceted nature, from temporal to semantic characterization. It categorizes automatic change detection methods into four main families: rule-based, statistical, machine learning, and simulation methods. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of every family are discussed in the context of various input data. Then, key applications for National Mapping Agencies are identified, particularly the optimization of geospatial database updating, change-based phenomena, and dynamics monitoring. Finally, the paper highlights the current challenges for leveraging change detection such as the variability of change definition, the missing of relevant large-scale datasets, the diversity of input data, the unstudied no-change detection, the human in the loop integration and the operational constraints. The discussion underscores the necessity for ongoing innovation in change detection techniques to address the future needs of geographic information systems for national mapping agencies.

<title>Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Generation and Rollover Budget Forcing</title>

Abstract: We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.

Abstract: Despite domain-adaptive object detectors based on CNN and transformers have made significant progress in cross-domain detection tasks, it is regrettable that domain adaptation for real-time transformer-based detectors has not yet been explored. Directly applying existing domain adaptation algorithms has proven to be suboptimal. In this paper, we propose RT-DATR, a simple and efficient real-time domain adaptive detection transformer. Building on RT-DETR as our base detector, we first introduce a local object-level feature alignment module to significantly enhance the feature representation of domain invariance during object transfer. Additionally, we introduce a scene semantic feature alignment module designed to boost cross-domain detection performance by aligning scene semantic features. Finally, we introduced a domain query and decoupled it from the object query to further align the instance feature distribution within the decoder layer, reduce the domain gap, and maintain discriminative ability. Experimental results on various cross-domian benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/Jeremy-lf/RT-DATR.

Abstract: Idling vehicle detection (IVD) uses surveillance video and multichannel audio to localize and classify vehicles in the last frame as moving, idling, or engine-off in pick-up zones. IVD faces three challenges: (i) modality heterogeneity between visual cues and audio patterns; (ii) large box scale variation requiring multi-resolution detection; and (iii) training instability due to coupled detection heads. The previous end-to-end (E2E) model with simple CBAM-based bi-modal attention fails to handle these issues and often misses vehicles. We propose HAVT-IVD, a heterogeneity-aware network with a visual feature pyramid and decoupled heads. Experiments show HAVT-IVD improves mAP by 7.66 over the disjoint baseline and 9.42 over the E2E baseline.

Abstract: Multimodal agents, which integrate a controller e.g., a vision language model) with external tools, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex multimodal tasks. Existing approaches for training these agents, both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, depend on extensive human-annotated task-answer pairs and tool trajectories. However, for complex multimodal tasks, such annotations are prohibitively expensive or impractical to obtain. In this paper, we propose an iterative tool usage exploration method for multimodal agents without any pre-collected data, namely SPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of tool usage. Our method enables multimodal agents to autonomously discover effective tool usage strategies through self-exploration and optimization, eliminating the bottleneck of human annotation. SPORT has four iterative components: task synthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. We first synthesize multimodal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel trajectory exploration scheme, where step sampling and step verification are executed alternately to solve synthesized tasks. In step sampling, the agent tries different tools and obtains corresponding results. In step verification, we employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference data. The data is subsequently used to update the controller for tool usage through preference tuning, producing a SPORT agent. By interacting with real environments, the SPORT agent gradually evolves into a more refined and capable system. Evaluation in the GTA and GAIA benchmarks shows that the SPORT agent achieves 6.41% and 3.64% improvements, underscoring the generalization and effectiveness introduced by our method.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly excel at perception, understanding, and reasoning. However, current benchmarks inadequately evaluate their ability to perform these tasks continuously in dynamic, real-world environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce RTV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for MLLM real-time video analysis. RTV-Bench uses three key principles: (1) Multi-Timestamp Question Answering (MTQA), where answers evolve with scene changes; (2) Hierarchical Question Structure, combining basic and advanced queries; and (3) Multi-dimensional Evaluation, assessing the ability of continuous perception, understanding, and reasoning. RTV-Bench contains 552 diverse videos (167.2 hours) and 4,631 high-quality QA pairs. We evaluated leading MLLMs, including proprietary (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0), open-source offline (Qwen2.5-VL, VideoLLaMA3), and open-source real-time (VITA-1.5, InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive) models. Experiment results show open-source real-time models largely outperform offline ones but still trail top proprietary models. Our analysis also reveals that larger model size or higher frame sampling rates do not significantly boost RTV-Bench performance, sometimes causing slight decreases. This underscores the need for better model architectures optimized for video stream processing and long sequences to advance real-time video analysis with MLLMs. Our benchmark toolkit is available at: https://github.com/LJungang/RTV-Bench.

<title>Register and [CLS] tokens yield a decoupling of local and global features in large ViTs</title>

Abstract: Recent work has shown that the attention maps of the widely popular DINOv2 model exhibit artifacts, which hurt both model interpretability and performance on dense image tasks. These artifacts emerge due to the model repurposing patch tokens with redundant local information for the storage of global image information. To address this problem, additional register tokens have been incorporated in which the model can store such information instead. We carefully examine the influence of these register tokens on the relationship between global and local image features, showing that while register tokens yield cleaner attention maps, these maps do not accurately reflect the integration of local image information in large models. Instead, global information is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading to a disconnect between local and global features. Inspired by these findings, we show that the [CLS] token itself leads to a very similar phenomenon in models without explicit register tokens. Our work shows that care must be taken when interpreting attention maps of large ViTs. Further, by clearly attributing the faulty behavior to register and [CLS] tokens, we show a path towards more interpretable vision models.

<title>MELLM: Exploring LLM-Powered Micro-Expression Understanding Enhanced by Subtle Motion Perception</title>

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs), brief and low-intensity facial movements revealing concealed emotions, are crucial for affective computing. Despite notable progress in ME recognition, existing methods are largely confined to discrete emotion classification, lacking the capacity for comprehensive ME Understanding (MEU), particularly in interpreting subtle facial dynamics and underlying emotional cues. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential for MEU with their advanced reasoning abilities, they still struggle to perceive such subtle facial affective behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a ME Large Language Model (MELLM) that integrates optical flow-based sensitivity to subtle facial motions with the powerful inference ability of LLMs. Specifically, an iterative, warping-based optical-flow estimator, named MEFlowNet, is introduced to precisely capture facial micro-movements. For its training and evaluation, we construct MEFlowDataset, a large-scale optical-flow dataset with 54,611 onset-apex image pairs spanning diverse identities and subtle facial motions. Subsequently, we design a Flow-Guided Micro-Expression Understanding paradigm. Under this framework, the optical flow signals extracted by MEFlowNet are leveraged to build MEU-Instruct, an instruction-tuning dataset for MEU. MELLM is then fine-tuned on MEU-Instruct, enabling it to translate subtle motion patterns into human-readable descriptions and generate corresponding emotional inferences. Experiments demonstrate that MEFlowNet significantly outperforms existing optical flow methods in facial and ME-flow estimation, while MELLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and generalization across multiple ME benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents two key contributions: MEFlowNet as the first dedicated ME flow estimator, and MELLM as the first LLM tailored for MEU.

<title>Breaking the Batch Barrier (B3) of Contrastive Learning via Smart Batch Mining</title>

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) is a prevalent technique for training embedding models, which pulls semantically similar examples (positives) closer in the representation space while pushing dissimilar ones (negatives) further apart. A key source of negatives are 'in-batch' examples, i.e., positives from other examples in the batch. Effectiveness of such models is hence strongly influenced by the size and quality of training batches. In this work, we propose 'Breaking the Batch Barrier' (B3), a novel batch construction strategy designed to curate high-quality batches for CL. Our approach begins by using a pretrained teacher embedding model to rank all examples in the dataset, from which a sparse similarity graph is constructed. A community detection algorithm is then applied to this graph to identify clusters of examples that serve as strong negatives for one another. The clusters are then used to construct batches that are rich in in-batch negatives. Empirical results on the MMEB multimodal embedding benchmark (36 tasks) demonstrate that our method sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous best methods by +1.3 and +2.9 points at the 7B and 2B model scales, respectively. Notably, models trained with B3 surpass existing state-of-the-art results even with a batch size as small as 64, which is 4-16x smaller than that required by other methods. Moreover, experiments show that B3 generalizes well across domains and tasks, maintaining strong performance even when trained with considerably weaker teachers.

Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales. These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate SSR substantially improves depth utilization and enhances spatial reasoning, thereby advancing VLMs toward more human-like multi-modal understanding.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data. The code is available at https://github.com/bryanwong17/HiVE-MIL.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding in videos remains a major challenge for current Video Large Multimodal Models (Video LMMs). Addressing this challenge requires mastering two core capabilities: video referring understanding, which captures the semantics of video regions, and video grounding, which segments object regions based on natural language descriptions. However, most existing approaches tackle these tasks in isolation, limiting progress toward unified, referentially grounded video interaction. We identify a key bottleneck in the lack of high-quality, unified video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating referentially grounded video chat. To address these challenges, we contribute in three core aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce SAMA-239K, a large-scale dataset comprising 15K videos specifically curated to enable joint learning of video referring understanding, grounding, and multi-turn video chat. Second, we propose the SAMA model, which incorporates a versatile spatio-temporal context aggregator and a Segment Anything Model to jointly enhance fine-grained video comprehension and precise grounding capabilities. Finally, we establish SAMA-Bench, a meticulously designed benchmark consisting of 5,067 questions from 522 videos, to comprehensively evaluate the integrated capabilities of Video LMMs in multi-turn, spatio-temporal referring understanding and grounded dialogue. Extensive experiments and benchmarking results show that SAMA not only achieves strong performance on SAMA-Bench but also sets a new state-of-the-art on general grounding benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive performance on standard visual understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Properly evaluating the ability of Video-Language Models (VLMs) to understand long videos remains a challenge. We propose a long-context video understanding benchmark, Causal2Needles, that assesses two crucial abilities insufficiently addressed by existing benchmarks: (1) extracting information from two separate locations (two needles) in a long video and understanding them jointly, and (2) modeling the world in terms of cause and effect in human behaviors. Causal2Needles evaluates these abilities using noncausal one-needle, causal one-needle, and causal two-needle questions. The most complex question type, causal two-needle questions, require extracting information from both the cause and effect events from a long video and the associated narration text. To prevent textual bias, we introduce two complementary question formats: locating the video clip containing the answer, and verbal description of a visual detail from that video clip. Our experiments reveal that models excelling on existing benchmarks struggle with causal 2-needle questions, and the model performance is negatively correlated with the distance between the two needles. These findings highlight critical limitations in current VLMs. The dataset is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/causal2needles/Causal2Needles

Abstract: Controllability, temporal coherence, and detail synthesis remain the most critical challenges in video generation. In this paper, we focus on a commonly used yet underexplored cinematic technique known as Frame In and Frame Out. Specifically, starting from image-to-video generation, users can control the objects in the image to naturally leave the scene or provide breaking new identity references to enter the scene, guided by a user-specified motion trajectory. To support this task, we introduce a new dataset that is curated semi-automatically, an efficient identity-preserving motion-controllable video Diffusion Transformer architecture, and a comprehensive evaluation protocol targeting this task. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive applications such as virtual and augmented reality, where a first-person (egocentric) view captured by head-mounted cameras serves as key input. While this view offers fine-grained cues about user attention and hand-object interactions, its narrow field of view and lack of global context often lead to failures on spatially or contextually demanding queries. To address this, we introduce a framework that augments egocentric inputs with third-person (exocentric) views, providing complementary information such as global scene layout and object visibility to LVLMs. We present E3VQA, the first benchmark for multi-view question answering with 4K high-quality question-answer pairs grounded in synchronized ego-exo image pairs. Additionally, we propose M3CoT, a training-free prompting technique that constructs a unified scene representation by integrating scene graphs from three complementary perspectives. M3CoT enables LVLMs to reason more effectively across views, yielding consistent performance gains (4.84% for GPT-4o and 5.94% for Gemini 2.0 Flash) over a recent CoT baseline. Our extensive evaluation reveals key strengths and limitations of LVLMs in multi-view reasoning and highlights the value of leveraging both egocentric and exocentric inputs.

Abstract: The success of the machine learning field has reliably depended on training on large datasets. While effective, this trend comes at an extraordinary cost. This is due to two deeply intertwined factors: the size of models and the size of datasets. While promising research efforts focus on reducing the size of models, the other half of the equation remains fairly mysterious. Indeed, it is surprising that the standard approach to training remains to iterate over and over, uniformly sampling the training dataset. In this paper we explore a series of alternative training paradigms that leverage insights from hard-data-mining and dropout, simple enough to implement and use that can become the new training standard. The proposed Progressive Data Dropout reduces the number of effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of the baseline. This savings actually do not come at any cost for accuracy. Surprisingly, the proposed method improves accuracy by up to 4.82%. Our approach requires no changes to model architecture or optimizer, and can be applied across standard training pipelines, thus posing an excellent opportunity for wide adoption.

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches for river discharge forecasting have improved the accuracy and efficiency in flood forecasting, enabling more reliable early warning systems for risk management. Nevertheless, existing deep learning approaches in hydrology remain largely confined to local-scale applications and do not leverage the inherent spatial connections of bodies of water. Thus, there is a strong need for new deep learning methodologies that are capable of modeling spatio-temporal relations to improve river discharge and flood forecasting for scientific and operational applications. To address this, we present RiverMamba, a novel deep learning model that is pretrained with long-term reanalysis data and that can forecast global river discharge and floods on a $0.05^\circ$ grid up to $7$ days lead time, which is of high relevance in early warning. To achieve this, RiverMamba leverages efficient Mamba blocks that enable the model to capture spatio-temporal relations in very large river networks and enhance its forecast capability for longer lead times. The forecast blocks integrate ECMWF HRES meteorological forecasts, while accounting for their inaccuracies through spatio-temporal modeling. Our analysis demonstrates that RiverMamba provides reliable predictions of river discharge across various flood return periods, including extreme floods, and lead times, surpassing both AI- and physics-based models. The source code and datasets are publicly available at the project page https://hakamshams.github.io/RiverMamba.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as an efficient representation for rendering 3D scenes from 2D images and has been extended to images, videos, and dynamic 4D content. However, applying style transfer to GS-based representations, especially beyond simple color changes, remains challenging. In this work, we introduce CLIPGaussian, the first unified style transfer framework that supports text- and image-guided stylization across multiple modalities: 2D images, videos, 3D objects, and 4D scenes. Our method operates directly on Gaussian primitives and integrates into existing GS pipelines as a plug-in module, without requiring large generative models or retraining from scratch. The CLIPGaussian approach enables joint optimization of color and geometry in 3D and 4D settings, and achieves temporal coherence in videos, while preserving the model size. We demonstrate superior style fidelity and consistency across all tasks, validating CLIPGaussian as a universal and efficient solution for multimodal style transfer.

Abstract: Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated representations require features that are jointly informative across clients while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models, while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.

Abstract: The Arrow of Time (AoT)-time's irreversible flow shaping physical events-is fundamental to video comprehension, yet remains a significant challenge for modern large multimodal models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to perceive and utilize temporal directionality in video when responding to language queries, obstructing deeper temporal understanding. We tackle this deficiency by first providing a critical analysis of existing benchmarks and models. We then introduce ArrowRL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training strategy with an innovative reverse reward that instills AoT awareness by encouraging divergent video interpretations between forward and reversed visual frames. For rigorous evaluation, we additionally develop AoTBench, a new multi-faceted benchmark probing temporally challenging questions. Experiments show ArrowRL greatly advances temporal perception: it not only achieves substantial improvements on our challenging AoTBench but also demonstrably boosts performance on standard video question answering (VQA) benchmarks (with peak accuracy gains reaching over 20% and 10% respectively). This validates ArrowRL's effectiveness and highlights the critical need for dedicated AoT understanding in LMMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding, emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning. First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy.

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and $68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial settings. The code repository is available at https://github.com/rohban-lab/PatchGuard .

Abstract: Cutting-edge works have demonstrated that text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models can generate adversarial patches that mislead state-of-the-art object detectors in the physical world, revealing detectors' vulnerabilities and risks. However, these methods neglect the T2I patches' attack effectiveness when observed from different views in the physical world (i.e., angle robustness of the T2I adversarial patches). In this paper, we study the angle robustness of T2I adversarial patches comprehensively, revealing their angle-robust issues, demonstrating that texts affect the angle robustness of generated patches significantly, and task-specific linguistic instructions fail to enhance the angle robustness. Motivated by the studies, we introduce Angle-Robust Concept Learning (AngleRoCL), a simple and flexible approach that learns a generalizable concept (i.e., text embeddings in implementation) representing the capability of generating angle-robust patches. The learned concept can be incorporated into textual prompts and guides T2I models to generate patches with their attack effectiveness inherently resistant to viewpoint variations. Through extensive simulation and physical-world experiments on five SOTA detectors across multiple views, we demonstrate that AngleRoCL significantly enhances the angle robustness of T2I adversarial patches compared to baseline methods. Our patches maintain high attack success rates even under challenging viewing conditions, with over 50% average relative improvement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles. This research advances the understanding of physically angle-robust patches and provides insights into the relationship between textual concepts and physical properties in T2I-generated contents. We released our code at https://github.com/tsingqguo/anglerocl.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is increasingly used in machine learning for training and data augmentation. Yet, current strategies often rely on external foundation models or datasets, whose usage is restricted in many scenarios due to policy or legal constraints. We propose ScoreMix, a self-contained synthetic generation method to produce hard synthetic samples for recognition tasks by leveraging the score compositionality of diffusion models. The approach mixes class-conditioned scores along reverse diffusion trajectories, yielding domain-specific data augmentation without external resources. We systematically study class-selection strategies and find that mixing classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space yields larger gains, providing up to 3% additional average improvement, compared to selection based on proximity. Interestingly, we observe that condition and embedding spaces are largely uncorrelated under standard alignment metrics, and the generator's condition space has a negligible effect on downstream performance. Across 8 public face recognition benchmarks, ScoreMix improves accuracy by up to 7 percentage points, without hyperparameter search, highlighting both robustness and practicality. Our method provides a simple yet effective way to maximize discriminator performance using only the available dataset, without reliance on third-party resources.

Abstract: We propose an adaptive sampling framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that leverages comprehensive multi-view photometric error signals within a unified Metropolis-Hastings approach. Vanilla 3DGS heavily relies on heuristic-based density-control mechanisms (e.g., cloning, splitting, and pruning), which can lead to redundant computations or premature removal of beneficial Gaussians. Our framework overcomes these limitations by reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process, dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples and Deep Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed, achieving faster convergence while matching or modestly surpassing the view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Previous methods for image geo-localization have typically treated the task as either classification or retrieval, often relying on black-box decisions that lack interpretability. The rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has enabled a rethinking of geo-localization as a reasoning-driven task grounded in visual cues. However, two major challenges persist. On the data side, existing reasoning-focused datasets are primarily based on street-view imagery, offering limited scene diversity and constrained viewpoints. On the modeling side, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which yields only marginal improvements in reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs a reasoning-oriented geo-localization dataset, MP16-Reason, using diverse social media images. We introduce GLOBE, Group-relative policy optimization for Localizability assessment and Optimized visual-cue reasoning, yielding Bi-objective geo-Enhancement for the VLM in recognition and reasoning. GLOBE incorporates task-specific rewards that jointly enhance localizability assessment, visual-cue reasoning, and geolocation accuracy. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that GLOBE outperforms state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on geo-localization tasks, particularly in diverse visual scenes, while also generating more insightful and interpretable reasoning trajectories. The data and code are available at https://github.com/lingli1996/GLOBE.

Abstract: By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception. Consisting of approximately 80K LiDAR frames and 360K images, the dataset covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts, highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 17% of the data comprises dynamic interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane changes. AGC-Drive contains 350 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation utilities. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/PercepX/AGC-Drive.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly learning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as navigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene Completion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level information, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding. While PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images remain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based approaches utilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene volume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during training, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to dynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first method that leverages context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively initializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image context and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding to reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Extensive experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art in-domain performance, exhibits superior zero-shot generalization on out-of-domain data, and achieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14x. These results highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions, while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major factor contributing to this is the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark comprises 1,800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation. The dataset and evaluation codes will be available at https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/MultiHuman-Testbench.

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with large language models (LLMs), data collection and fine-tuning remain significant challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations, making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time scaling (TTS) strategy. Building on observations about the data scaling, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS surpasses existing video reasoning models by 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6% training samples. Specifically, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2% improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning benchmark. Notably, our pure RL training and adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong reasoning performance.

To extend this formulation to the manifold setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods in mesh denoising experiments.

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D computer vision algorithms continue to advance in handling sparse, unordered image sets. Recently developed foundational models for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction (DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps, stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches, especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios.

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues. Code and generated data are available at https://github.com/528why/Dataset-Condensation-with-Color-Compensation.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuGS), a generalized feed-forward approach for novel view synthesis that effectively handles diverse baseline settings, including sparse input views with both small and large baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for generalizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time while enhancing rendering quality. MuGS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple objects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K). We also demonstrate promising zero-shot performance on the LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360 datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/EuclidLou/MuGS.

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow ($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a $\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost, regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive evaluations on the Argoverse 2, Waymo and nuScenes datasets show that $\Delta$Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$ faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Kin-Zhang/DeltaFlow along with trained model weights.

<title>Enhancing Feature Fusion of U-like Networks with Dynamic Skip Connections</title>

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like networks.

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons, posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using 3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we propose a series of geometry-guided supervision steps at virtual views in pixel and feature levels to encourage 3D consistency and reduce overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and multi-appearance conditions, and outperforms existing approaches significantly across different datasets.

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists: their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates competitive performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

Abstract: Synthetic data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet current state-of-the-art video generation models, despite their visual realism, suffer from subtle geometric distortions that limit their utility for downstream perception tasks. We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for AD development.

Abstract: Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source, the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the effects of CAR-Flow. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256), equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data, posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes in the realm of unsupervised learning.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an \textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing applications.

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content moderation

<title>NPN: Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aim to recover high-dimensional signals from undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity, prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work, we propose Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space (NPN), a novel class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems, compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods. Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods, unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Abstract: Ecological monitoring is increasingly automated by vision models, yet opaque predictions limit trust and field adoption. We present an inpainting-guided, perturbation-based explanation technique that produces photorealistic, mask-localized edits that preserve scene context. Unlike masking or blurring, these edits stay in-distribution and reveal which fine-grained morphological cues drive predictions in tasks such as species recognition and trait attribution. We demonstrate the approach on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, using Segment-Anything-Model-refined masks to support two interventions: (i) object removal/replacement (e.g., replacing seals with plausible ice/water or boats) and (ii) background replacement with original animals composited onto new scenes. Explanations are assessed by re-scoring perturbed images (flip rate, confidence drop) and by expert review for ecological plausibility and interpretability. The resulting explanations localize diagnostic structures, avoid deletion artifacts common to traditional perturbations, and yield domain-relevant insights that support expert validation and more trustworthy deployment of AI in ecology.

Abstract: Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180 degree view-point change rotation. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and local feature matching methods, by up to 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++ and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance mapping and object-relative navigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in 3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision (e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even with supervised approaches.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) possesses great practical values in various fields, including power and energy, transportation, etc. TSF methods have been studied based on knowledge from classical statistics to modern deep learning. Yet, all of them were developed based on one fundamental concept, the numerical data fitting. Thus, the models developed have long been known to be problem-specific and lacking application generalizability. Practitioners expect a TSF foundation model that serves TSF tasks in different applications. The central question is then how to develop such a TSF foundation model. This paper offers one pioneering study in the TSF foundation model development method and proposes a vision intelligence-powered framework, ViTime, for the first time. ViTime fundamentally shifts TSF from numerical fitting to operations based on a binary image-based time series metric space and naturally supports both point and probabilistic forecasting. We also provide rigorous theoretical analyses of ViTime, including quantization-induced system error bounds and principled strategies for optimal parameter selection. Furthermore, we propose RealTS, an innovative synthesis algorithm generating diverse and realistic training samples, effectively enriching the training data and significantly enhancing model generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViTime's state-of-the-art performance. In zero-shot scenarios, ViTime outperforms TimesFM by 9-15\%. With just 10\% fine-tuning data, ViTime surpasses both leading foundation models and fully-supervised benchmarks, a gap that widens with 100\% fine-tuning. ViTime also exhibits exceptional robustness, effectively handling missing data and outperforming TimesFM by 20-30\% under various data perturbations, validating the power of its visual space data operation paradigm.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable accuracy in medical image segmentation, particularly for larger structures with well-defined boundaries. However, its effectiveness can be challenged by factors such as irregular object shapes and edges, non-smooth surfaces, small target areas, etc. which complicate the ability of networks to grasp the intricate and diverse nature of anatomical regions. In response to these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Focal Loss (A-FL) that takes both object boundary smoothness and size into account, with the goal to improve segmentation performance in intricate anatomical regions. The proposed A-FL dynamically adjusts itself based on an object's surface smoothness, size, and the class balancing parameter based on the ratio of targeted area and background. We evaluated the performance of the A-FL on the PICAI 2022 and BraTS 2018 datasets. In the PICAI 2022 dataset, the A-FL achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.696 and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.769, outperforming the regular Focal Loss (FL) by 5.5% and 5.4% respectively. It also surpassed the best baseline by 2.0% and 1.2%. In the BraTS 2018 dataset, A-FL achieved an IoU score of 0.883 and a DSC score of 0.931. Our ablation experiments also show that the proposed A-FL surpasses conventional losses (this includes Dice Loss, Focal Loss, and their hybrid variants) by large margin in IoU, DSC, and other metrics.

Abstract: In the realm of neuroscience, identifying distinctive patterns associated with neurological disorders via brain networks is crucial. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) serves as a primary tool for mapping these networks by correlating blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across different brain regions, defined as regions of interest (ROIs). Constructing these brain networks involves using atlases to parcellate the brain into ROIs based on various hypotheses of brain division. However, there is no standard atlas for brain network classification, leading to limitations in detecting abnormalities in disorders. Some recent methods have proposed utilizing multiple atlases, but they neglect consistency across atlases and lack ROI-level information exchange. To tackle these limitations, we propose an Atlas-Integrated Distillation and Fusion network (AIDFusion) to improve brain network classification using fMRI data. AIDFusion addresses the challenge of utilizing multiple atlases by employing a disentangle Transformer to filter out inconsistent atlas-specific information and distill distinguishable connections across atlases. It also incorporates subject- and population-level consistency constraints to enhance cross-atlas consistency. Additionally, AIDFusion employs an inter-atlas message-passing mechanism to fuse complementary information across brain regions. Experimental results on four datasets of different diseases demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AIDFusion compared to state-of-the-art methods. A case study illustrates AIDFusion extract patterns that are both interpretable and consistent with established neuroscience findings.

Abstract: As a highly expressive generative model, diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional success across various domains, including image generation, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, as data distributions grow more complex, training these models to convergence becomes increasingly computationally intensive. While diffusion models are typically trained using uniform timestep sampling, our research shows that the variance in stochastic gradients varies significantly across timesteps, with high-variance timesteps becoming bottlenecks that hinder faster convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a non-uniform timestep sampling method that prioritizes these more critical timesteps. Our method tracks the impact of gradient updates on the objective for each timestep, adaptively selecting those most likely to minimize the objective effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only accelerates the training process, but also leads to improved performance at convergence. Furthermore, our method shows robust performance across various datasets, scheduling strategies, and diffusion architectures, outperforming previously proposed timestep sampling and weighting heuristics that lack this degree of robustness.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an inherently multi-contrast modality, where cross-contrast priors can be exploited to improve image reconstruction from undersampled data. Recently, diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in MRI reconstruction. However, they still struggle to effectively utilize such priors, mainly because existing methods rely on feature-level fusion in image or latent spaces, which lacks explicit structural correspondence and thus leads to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose $\mathbf{I}^2$SB-Inversion, a multi-contrast guided reconstruction framework based on the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB). The proposed method performs pixel-wise translation between paired contrasts, providing explicit structural constraints between the guidance and target images. Furthermore, an Inversion strategy is introduced to correct inter-modality misalignment, which often occurs in guided reconstruction, thereby mitigating artifacts and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on paired T1- and T2-weighted datasets demonstrate that $\mathbf{I}^2$SB-Inversion achieves a high acceleration factor of up to 14.4 and consistently outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading to a misalignment between the user intent and models' understanding. As a result, users commonly have to painstakingly refine their prompts. We study this alignment problem in text-to-image (T2I) generation and propose a prototype for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their uncertainty about user intent as an understandable and editable belief graph. We build simple prototypes for such agents and propose a new scalable and automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth intent (an image) while the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. We experiment over three image-text datasets: ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and DesignBench, a benchmark we curated with strong artistic and design elements. Experiments over the three datasets demonstrate the proposed T2I agents' ability to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard T2I generation. Moreover, we conducted human studies and observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Code and DesignBench can be found at https://github.com/google-deepmind/proactive_t2i_agents.

Abstract: Deep learning model effectiveness in classification tasks is often challenged by the quality and quantity of training data whenever they are affected by strong spurious correlations between specific attributes and target labels. This results in a form of bias affecting training data, which typically leads to unrecoverable weak generalization in prediction. This paper aims at facing this problem by leveraging bias amplification with generated synthetic data: we introduce Diffusing DeBias (DDB), a novel approach acting as a plug-in for common methods of unsupervised model debiasing exploiting the inherent bias-learning tendency of diffusion models in data generation. Specifically, our approach adopts conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic bias-aligned images, which replace the original training set for learning an effective bias amplifier model that we subsequently incorporate into an end-to-end and a two-step unsupervised debiasing approach. By tackling the fundamental issue of bias-conflicting training samples memorization in learning auxiliary models, typical of this type of techniques, our proposed method beats current state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating its potential as a versatile and effective tool for tackling bias in deep learning models.

Abstract: Invisible Image Watermarking is crucial for ensuring content provenance and accountability in generative AI. While Gen-AI providers are increasingly integrating invisible watermarking systems, the robustness of these schemes against forgery attacks remains poorly characterized. This is critical, as forging traceable watermarks onto illicit content leads to false attribution, potentially harming the reputation and legal standing of Gen-AI service providers who are not responsible for the content. In this work, we propose WMCopier, an effective watermark forgery attack that operates without requiring any prior knowledge of or access to the target watermarking algorithm. Our approach first models the target watermark distribution using an unconditional diffusion model, and then seamlessly embeds the target watermark into a non-watermarked image via a shallow inversion process. We also incorporate an iterative optimization procedure that refines the reconstructed image to further trade off the fidelity and forgery efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that WMCopier effectively deceives both open-source and closed-source watermark systems (e.g., Amazon's system), achieving a significantly higher success rate than existing methods. Additionally, we evaluate the robustness of forged samples and discuss the potential defenses against our attack.

<title>Some Optimizers are More Equal: Understanding the Role of Optimizers in Group Fairness</title>

arXiv:2504.14882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study whether and how the choice of optimization algorithm can impact group fairness in deep neural networks. Through stochastic differential equation analysis of optimization dynamics in an analytically tractable setup, we demonstrate that the choice of optimization algorithm indeed influences fairness outcomes, particularly under severe imbalance. Furthermore, we show that when comparing two categories of optimizers, adaptive methods and stochastic methods, RMSProp (from the adaptive category) has a higher likelihood of converging to fairer minima than SGD (from the stochastic category). Building on this insight, we derive two new theoretical guarantees showing that, under appropriate conditions, RMSProp exhibits fairer parameter updates and improved fairness in a single optimization step compared to SGD. We then validate these findings through extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, namely CelebA, FairFace, and MS-COCO, across different tasks as facial expression recognition, gender classification, and multi-label classification, using various backbones. Considering multiple fairness definitions including equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic parity, adaptive optimizers like RMSProp and Adam consistently outperform SGD in terms of group fairness, while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy. Our results highlight the role of adaptive updates as a crucial yet overlooked mechanism for promoting fair outcomes. We release the source code at: https://github.com/Mkolahdoozi/Some-Optimizers-Are-More-Equal.

<title>Approximating Signed Distance Fields of Implicit Surfaces with Sparse Ellipsoidal Radial Basis Function Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02350</link>

arXiv:2505.02350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and compact representation of signed distance functions (SDFs) of implicit surfaces is crucial for efficient storage, computation, and downstream processing of 3D geometry. In this work, we propose a general learning method for approximating precomputed SDF fields of implicit surfaces by a relatively small number of ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs). The SDF values could be computed from various sources, including point clouds, triangle meshes, analytical expressions, pretrained neural networks, etc. Given SDF values on spatial grid points, our method approximates the SDF using as few ERBFs as possible, achieving a compact representation while preserving the geometric shape of the corresponding implicit surface. To balance sparsity and approximation precision, we introduce a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy, which adaptively incorporates regularization to enforce sparsity and jointly optimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of the ERBFs. For computational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure restricts computations to points near each kernel center, and CUDA-based parallelism further accelerates the optimization. Furthermore, a hierarchical refinement strategy based on SDF spatial grid points progressively incorporates coarse-to-fine samples for parameter initialization and optimization, improving convergence and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can represent SDF fields with significantly fewer parameters than existing sparse implicit representation approaches, achieving better accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. The corresponding executable program is publicly available at https://github.com/lianbobo/SE-RBFNet.git

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in smart grids have advanced significantly in recent years due to their ability to generate large amounts of synthetic data, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain in the real world due to confidentiality constraints. A key challenge in utilizing such synthetic data is how to assess the data quality produced from such generative models. Traditional Euclidean distance-based metrics only reflect pair-wise relations between two individual samples, and could fail in evaluating quality differences between groups of synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a novel metric based on the Fr\'{e}chet Distance (FD) estimated between two datasets in a learned feature space. The proposed method evaluates the quality of generation from a distributional perspective. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metric across timescales and models, enhancing the reliability of data-driven decision-making in smart grid operations.

<title>Seeing Sound, Hearing Sight: Uncovering Modality Bias and Conflict of AI models in Sound Localization</title>

Abstract: Imagine hearing a dog bark and turning toward the sound only to see a parked car, while the real, silent dog sits elsewhere. Such sensory conflicts test perception, yet humans reliably resolve them by prioritizing sound over misleading visuals. Despite advances in multimodal AI integrating vision and audio, little is known about how these systems handle cross-modal conflicts or whether they favor one modality. In this study, we systematically examine modality bias and conflict resolution in AI sound localization. We assess leading multimodal models and benchmark them against human performance in psychophysics experiments across six audiovisual conditions, including congruent, conflicting, and absent cues. Humans consistently outperform AI, demonstrating superior resilience to conflicting or missing visuals by relying on auditory information. In contrast, AI models often default to visual input, degrading performance to near chance levels. To address this, we propose a neuroscience-inspired model, EchoPin, which uses a stereo audio-image dataset generated via 3D simulations. Even with limited training data, EchoPin surpasses existing benchmarks. Notably, it also mirrors human-like horizontal localization bias favoring left-right precision-likely due to the stereo audio structure reflecting human ear placement. These findings underscore how sensory input quality and system architecture shape multimodal representation accuracy.

KnotGym includes goal-oriented rope manipulation tasks with varying levels of complexity, all requiring acting from pure image observations. Tasks are defined along a clear and quantifiable axis of complexity based on the number of knot crossings, creating a natural generalization test. KnotGym has a simple observation space, allowing for scalable development, yet it highlights core challenges in integrating acute perception, spatial reasoning, and grounded manipulation. We evaluate methods of different classes, including model-based RL, model-predictive control, and chain-of-thought reasoning, and illustrate the challenges KnotGym presents.

arXiv:2506.02489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to vision-based dexterous grasp translation, which aims to transfer grasp intent across robotic hands with differing morphologies. Given a visual observation of a source hand grasping an object, our goal is to synthesize a functionally equivalent grasp for a target hand without requiring paired demonstrations or hand-specific simulations. We frame this problem as a stochastic transport between grasp distributions using the Schr\"odinger Bridge formalism. Our method learns to map between source and target latent grasp spaces via score and flow matching, conditioned on visual observations. To guide this translation, we introduce physics-informed cost functions that encode alignment in base pose, contact maps, wrench space, and manipulability. Experiments across diverse hand-object pairs demonstrate our approach generates stable, physically grounded grasps with strong generalization. This work enables semantic grasp transfer for heterogeneous manipulators and bridges vision-based grasping with probabilistic generative modeling. Additional details at https://grasp2grasp.github.io/

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same number of parameters. We also find limited settings--namely fitting binary signals such as shape contours--where INRs outperform grids, to guide future development and use of INRs towards the most advantageous applications.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact "student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger "teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation, it has become the de facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically, this term is either a KL divergence that matches marginal probabilities or a correlation-based loss that captures intra- and inter-class relationships. In every case, it acts as an additional term to cross-entropy. This term has its own weight, which must be carefully tuned. In this paper, we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce "Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD)", a weighted list-wise ranking loss. In PLD, the teacher model transfers knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single "teacher-optimal" ranking. The true label is placed first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher confidence. This process yields a convex and translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy. Empirically, across CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and MS-COCO, PLD achieves consistent gains across diverse architectures and distillation objectives, including divergence-based, correlation-based, and feature-based methods, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous teacher-student pairs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

<title>A robust and versatile deep learning model for prediction of the arterial input function in dynamic small animal $\left[^{18}\text{F}\right]$FDG PET imaging</title>

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures, precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence, extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation. Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical image segmentation. Nonetheless, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba Selective State Space Model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through adaptive expert routing. In the first level, a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer partitions input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second level aggregates these outputs through a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design, combining local expert routing with global expert refinement, enhances generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art results across datasets from the three most widely used 3D medical imaging modalities and varying data qualities. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/gmum/MambaHoME.

Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) offers simplified training but suffers from residual magnitude decay in multi-stage settings, where subsequent stages receive exponentially weaker signals. We propose Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ), addressing this fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our experiments across audio and image modalities demonstrate RFSQ's effectiveness and generalizability. In audio reconstruction at 24 bits/frame, RFSQ-LayerNorm achieves 3.646 DNSMOS, a 3.6% improvement over state-of-the-art RVQ (3.518). On ImageNet, RFSQ achieves 0.102 L1 loss and 0.100 perceptual loss, with LayerNorm providing 9.7% L1 improvement and 17.4% perceptual improvement over unconditioned variants. The LayerNorm strategy consistently outperforms alternatives by maintaining normalized input statistics across stages, effectively preventing exponential magnitude decay that limits naive residual approaches. RFSQ combines FSQ's simplicity with multi-stage quantization's representational power, establishing a new standard for neural compression across diverse modalities.

arXiv:2510.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while drastically reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Summary:<br />
Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have led to notable progress in creating high-quality videos from static images, particularly focusing on human-centric applications. However, maintaining identity consistency in generated videos remains a challenge, especially when the subject undergoes significant expression changes or movements. To address this issue, a novel approach called Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO) is proposed. This framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize diffusion models based on a face identity scorer, without the need for additional modules or architectural modifications. By backpropagating the reward signal and incorporating a facial scoring mechanism, the model achieves improved performance and convergence speed. Furthermore, a KL-divergence regularization is introduced to enhance training stability and prevent overfitting. Experimental results on existing I2V models validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our project and code are available at https://ipro-alimama.github.io/.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However, mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs, thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs. Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95, significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of industrial AI systems.

<div> ViTs, contrastive learning, 3D shape features, representation learning, supervised and self-supervised learning <br />
<br />
Summary: 
This paper investigates the challenges of learning 3D shape features using state-of-the-art backbones and contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Traditional computer vision methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring extensive labeled data and CNNs that may overlook important shape relationships. The study shows that using Vision Transformers (ViTs) with modern contrastive objectives achieves promising results in multi-view 3D analysis, with supervised contrastive losses reaching 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10. By combining ViTs' ability to capture global shape semantics with contrastive learning's effectiveness in refining local features, the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs can be overcome. The approach is validated through extensive experimental evaluation, demonstrating the efficacy of ViTs paired with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning. <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines. For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness, overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

<br />
Summary: FutrTrack is a new modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that enhances existing 3D detectors by introducing transformer-based smoother and fusion-driven tracker components. It utilizes a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline, integrating bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR. FutrTrack employs a fusion tracker that assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. A temporal smoother refines sequences of bounding boxes, improving trajectories, reducing jitter, and enhancing spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI datasets, FutrTrack achieves a strong performance with an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, demonstrating the benefits of query-based transformer tracking methods utilizing multimodal sensor features. This approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based tracking in 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy even without pretraining or extensive data. <div>

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.

Summary: 
Deep learning models like convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in medical image classification. However, these models often make overly confident predictions, which can be problematic in critical healthcare scenarios. Traditional label smoothing methods do not consider class relationships adequately. In this study, researchers explore the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft labels based on the model's predictions during training. Evaluation on the RadImageNet dataset using popular architectures like ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19 shows that OLS consistently improves accuracy compared to standard methods. OLS also enhances representation learning by creating more compact and well-separated feature embeddings. These results indicate that OLS not only boosts predictive performance but also improves calibration, making it a valuable tool for building reliable AI systems in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing, and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the medical imaging domain.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point. However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors, particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to fisheye imagery.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a real-time render-aware filtering method to address visual noise in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models when viewed from camera positions outside the training data distribution. By utilizing sensitivity scores from intermediate gradients and targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic orientations, the filtering method improves visual quality, realism, and consistency in 3D reconstruction systems. Compared to existing approaches like BayesRays, the proposed method effectively reduces generative uncertainty and maintains high visual fidelity even outside original training viewpoints. Crucially, the filter seamlessly integrates into 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time, negating the need for extensive post-hoc retraining. Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in visual quality, making the proposed method a valuable addition to enhance the performance of 3D reconstruction systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.20027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time, unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

- BrainPuzzle combines physical modeling with machine learning for better results.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain. Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound brain imaging.

Summary: 
1. The study examines cultural bias in generative image models, focusing on both text-to-image and image-to-image systems.
2. A standardized evaluation framework is used to compare models across six countries, utilizing an 8-category/36-subcategory schema and era-aware prompts.
3. The research reveals that models default to Global-North, modern-leaning depictions under country-agnostic prompts, flattening cross-country distinctions.
4. Iterative image-to-image editing processes can erode cultural fidelity, despite conventional metrics showing no significant changes.
5. Image-to-image models tend to apply superficial cues rather than making era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source identity for Global-South targets.
6. The release of standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols provides a reproducible benchmark for tracking cultural bias in generative image models.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.20042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I) systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics, a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1) under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve; and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props) rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural bias in generative image models.

<div> Filter Based Asynchronous Reconstruction, intensity image, moving event camera, FIBAR method, neural networks <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper presents the Filter Based Asynchronous Reconstruction (FIBAR) method for reconstructing intensity images from moving event cameras. FIBAR uses a digital IIR filter to integrate intensity changes signaled by events and a novel algorithm to detect stale pixels and reduce reconstruction noise. Stale pixels are blurred with a Gaussian filter based on the assumption that the absence of events at a pixel location indicates a low image gradient. Unlike traditional methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and allows image read-out at any time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at a high event rate with or without spatial filtering enabled. While FIBAR's reconstruction may be noisier and suffer from ghost images compared to neural network-based methods, it is adequate for specific tasks like detecting fiducial markers. The paper provides code for the FIBAR method on GitHub for reference. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.20071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection of fiducial markers.

This paper introduces a novel model, TBTLRR, for image clustering that addresses the limitations of existing methods. TBTLRR utilizes a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning unitary transforms to capture global correlations effectively. It leverages the bilateral structure of latent tensor data to exploit local correlations between image samples and features. The model also integrates $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm regularization terms to handle noise in real-world scenarios. An efficient optimization algorithm based on ADMM is proposed to solve the nonconvex model, with theoretical convergence guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of TBTLRR over state-of-the-art methods in image clustering tasks. The code implementation of TBTLRR will be made available for public use. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features. Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5), with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10). Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001), and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent, user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

<title>Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency</title>

<div> Keywords: Self-attention, Convolution, Adaptive routing, Lateral inhibition, Attentive Convolution

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper explores the differences between self-attention (SA) and convolution in neural networks, highlighting two key insights. Firstly, SA dynamically regulates information flow based on content, while convolution uses static kernels. Secondly, SA induces competition among token weights, reducing redundancy and enhancing representations, a feature lacking in convolutional filters. Based on these insights, the authors propose Attentive Convolution (ATConv), a reformulation of convolution that incorporates these principles. Remarkably, with only 3x3 kernels, ATConv consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in vision tasks. Introducing AttNet, a CNN family based on ATConv, achieves 84.4% ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with just 27M parameters. In image generation tasks, replacing SA with ATConv in SiT-XL/2 leads to a reduction in ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster sampling. The code for implementation is available on GitHub. <div>
arXiv:2510.20092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications. Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research (e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}: SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions. (2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations, whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv), a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks. Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain \textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times 3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster sampling.

Summary: 
StableSketcher is introduced as a framework for generating high-quality hand-drawn sketches using diffusion models. By fine-tuning the variational autoencoder and incorporating a new reward function based on visual question answering, the framework enhances the fidelity and alignment of generated sketches with prompts. StableSketcher outperforms the Stable Diffusion baseline in terms of stylistic fidelity and prompt alignment. The newly created dataset SketchDUO includes instance-level sketches paired with captions and question-answer pairs, addressing limitations of existing datasets that only have image-label pairs. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of StableSketcher in generating sketches with improved stylistic fidelity and semantic consistency. The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline. Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

<div> supervision, biological multimodal foundation models, captions, species classification, text-image retrieval<br />
Summary: This work explores the use of descriptive captions as additional supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Captions and images are seen as complementary representations of a species, with captions capturing specific biological traits. By incorporating captions during training, the model can align with a shared latent structure and focus on relevant biological characteristics while eliminating irrelevant correlations. One of the main challenges is obtaining accurate, instance-specific captions at scale. To address this, synthetic captions are generated using multimodal large language models, guided by visual information from Wikipedia and taxon-specific examples. These descriptions help reduce errors and improve the accuracy of the captions. The BIOCAP model, trained with these enhanced captions, achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval tasks. This study showcases the value of descriptive captions in enhancing the capabilities of biological multimodal foundation models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure, emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate, instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP (i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models.

<div> Keywords: light fields, view synthesis, image-based rendering, neural rendering, novel view synthesis

Summary:
Light-field technology, which involves computing light fields from multiple view images on regular grids, has been beneficial for realistic scene representations and renderings. This paper introduces a new method called inverse image-based rendering to generate light fields from single images. Unlike previous approaches that reconstruct 3D geometry, the proposed method focuses on reconstructing light flows in a space from image pixels. A neural rendering pipeline is designed to achieve this, storing light flow information from source rays, computing relationships through cross-attention, and predicting target ray colors. The pipeline iteratively generates novel views from a single image, updating out-of-view contents and ensuring consistent generation of occluded contents. The method performs well on challenging datasets without the need for retraining, outperforming existing novel view synthesis techniques. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships. After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

<div> LogitGap, OOD detection, deep learning, logits space, post-hoc method
Summary:<br /><br />LogitGap is a new method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in deep learning models. It leverages the relationship between the maximum logit and other logits to improve the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. By focusing on a more informative subset of the logit space, LogitGap automatically identifies the most relevant logits for scoring without requiring training. The approach has been validated theoretically and empirically, showing superior performance compared to existing methods across various OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code for LogitGap is available on GitHub, making it accessible for further research and application in open-world deep learning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.20134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space. Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering, a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity. By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D understanding.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous Driving, Vulnerable Road Users, Pose Estimation, 8D Pose, Articulated Bicycles

Summary:
In the field of Autonomous Driving, accurately estimating the pose of cyclists is crucial for safety. This study focuses on developing a method for category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a single RGB image. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles have movable parts linked by joints, making their pose estimation more complex. The proposed method not only estimates the 3D translation and rotation of a bicycle but also the rotations of its steering handles and pedals relative to the bicycle body frame. By incorporating these additional parameters, a more detailed pose state and travel direction of the bicycle can be determined. The model is trained using a combination of synthetic and real image data, showing promising results in accurately estimating the 8D pose parameters of articulated bicycles. Additionally, the method achieves competitive scores when compared to state-of-the-art 6D pose estimators that use rigid canonical object templates for matching. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure. 6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles, but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Summary: 
The proposed approach in this paper addresses the challenge of distribution shift in Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) by updating multimodal prototypes using textual and visual knowledge from unsupervised data at test time. An adaptive update weight is introduced to facilitate flexible prototype adjustment during testing, while a dynamic priority queue is utilized to store high-confidence images for acquiring visual knowledge from historical data. Through multimodal collaborative representation learning, textual and visual prototypes are aligned to ensure semantic consistency.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

Summary: 
The new IB-GAN model integrates the Information Bottleneck framework into GAN optimization for disentangled representation learning. Similar to InfoGAN, IB-GAN uses an intermediate layer in the generator to constrain mutual information between input and output, enabling the generator to learn a disentangled and interpretable latent space. Experimental results on dSprites and Color-dSprites datasets show that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores compared to state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Additionally, IB-GAN generates visually better and more diverse samples than \b{eta}-VAEs and InfoGAN in terms of FID score on CelebA and 3D Chairs datasets. This demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of IB-GAN for unsupervised disentangled representation learning.

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output. The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover, the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA and 3D Chairs dataset.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost. To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a `play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer computational costs.

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters. Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Suspicion Progression Analysis Network (SPAN) for Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) in video surveillance. SPAN employs continuous regression to capture the evolving nature of suspicious intentions, outperforming existing discrete classification methods. By modeling suspicion as a continuous variable with long-term dependencies, SPAN improves detection accuracy and reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 19.8% while increasing average mAP by 1.78%. The Suspicion Coefficient Modulation adjusts suspicion coefficients using multimodal information, enhancing the system's ability to detect subtle behavioral changes. The Concept-Anchored Mapping method links suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into underlying intentions. SPAN's continuous suspicion modeling allows for earlier detection and proactive intervention, improving system explainability and practical utility in security applications. It achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating its superior performance in capturing subtle changes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance, focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions. Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%. Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system explainability and practical utility in security applications.

- The study analyzes 54 publicly available brain MRI datasets to evaluate the scale, diversity, and consistency of data for foundation model development.
- Imbalances exist between healthy and clinical populations in dataset composition.
- Heterogeneity across datasets in voxel spacing, orientation, and intensity distributions can impact representation learning.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing, orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets, demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction, skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a 3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces RAPO++, a framework designed to optimize prompts for text-to-video generation. RAPO++ consists of three stages: Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with relevant modifiers, Sample-Specific Prompt Optimization (SSPO) iteratively refines prompts for improved video generation quality, and fine-tuning the rewriter LLM using optimized prompt pairs. The framework aims to improve semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility in T2V models. Through extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models and benchmarks, RAPO++ outperforms existing methods significantly. It is a cost-efficient, model-agnostic, and scalable solution for prompt optimization in T2V generation. The code for RAPO++ is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Vchitect/RAPO. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models. We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1}, Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++ achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic, cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt optimization in T2V generation.

<div> FlowCycle, text-to-image, image editing, corruption-then-restoration paradigm, target-aware intermediate state<br />
Summary:<br />
FlowCycle is a new text-to-image editing framework that aims to enhance the editability and consistency of image editing processes. It introduces a target-aware intermediate state concept, which selectively corrupts editing-relevant contents while preserving editing-irrelevant ones. By using learnable noises to parameterize corruption and optimizing them through a cycle-consistent process, FlowCycle achieves faithful modifications while maintaining source consistency. This inversion-free and flow-based editing approach outperforms current methods by producing superior editing quality and consistency. The proposed framework has been extensively evaluated through ablations, demonstrating its effectiveness in text-based image editing tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.20212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Summary: CURL is proposed for accurate fetal movement detection from ultrasound videos, addressing challenges of traditional methods like subjectivity and accuracy. It uses dual-contrastive loss for robust motion representations and a task-specific sampling strategy for effective training. CURL achieves 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC on a dataset of 92 subjects with 30-minute sessions, showing promise for objective FM analysis.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy, ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions, CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis, paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

<div> Keywords: diffusion-based generative models, text-driven image editing, VQ-based generative models, image inversion, EditInfinity.

Summary: 
EditInfinity proposes an adaptation of Infinity, a binary-quantized generative model, for text-driven image editing. The approach focuses on efficient and effective image inversion, integrating text prompting rectification and image style preservation for precise inversion. A holistic smoothing strategy enables high-fidelity image editing with precise alignment to text prompts. The method outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines on the PIE-Bench benchmark, across "add," "change," and "delete" editing operations. The approach leverages the exact intermediate quantized representations of source images in VQ-based generative models to provide more effective supervision for precise image inversion. EditInfinity demonstrates superior performance in image editing tasks, showcasing the potential of adapting VQ-based models for text-driven image editing scenarios. The code is available on GitHub for implementation and further research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential. A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion, then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models, which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing, and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose \emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines.

<title>Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context</title>

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, hallucination, context, coherence, mitigation <br />
Summary: 
In this paper, the authors investigate the phenomenon of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and explore the underlying mechanisms that contribute to this issue. They propose a novel framework called "induce-detect-suppress" to actively induce hallucinations in controlled contexts, detect high-risk cases early, and suppress potential hallucinations during decoding. Through their experiments, they affirm that hallucinations in LVLMs are not solely caused by the length of responses but by the increased reliance on context for coherence and completeness. The proposed framework shows consistent and significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations. This study not only advances the understanding of hallucinations in LVLMs but also highlights the importance of context in generating coherent and accurate responses. <div>
arXiv:2510.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism? After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses. Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress" framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly, re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

<div> Keywords: 3D segmentation, language collaboration, instance field, segmentation cues, prompt-segmentation framework

Summary:
COS3D introduces a collaborative prompt-segmentation framework for open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, addressing limitations in existing methods. The framework incorporates a collaborative field consisting of an instance field and a language field, enhancing the integration of segmentation and language cues. A novel instance-to-language feature mapping captures the relationship between the fields, improving the training process. An adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement is designed for efficient inference, promoting high-quality segmentation results. COS3D demonstrates superior performance on benchmarks and shows promise in applications like image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics. The code for COS3D is publicly available for further research and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task, requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However, existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations, we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship between the instance field and language field, through a novel instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics.

<div> keywords: Video Temporal Grounding, Moment Retrieval, Highlight Detection, CLIP, DualGround 

Summary:
DualGround addresses the limitations of existing Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) models by introducing a dual-branch architecture that separates global and local semantics. By routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word tokens into phrase-level units, the model can effectively utilize word-level signals for fine-grained temporal alignment. Token-role-aware cross-modal interaction strategies ensure alignment of video features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally disentangled manner. A joint modeling framework enhances global sentence-level alignment and fine-grained temporal grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. These design choices allow DualGround to capture both coarse and localized semantics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long, untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention, disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces (1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

<div> Keywords: Cross-view object geo-localization, mask-based positional encoding, object-aware modeling, context enhancement module, satellite imagery

Summary: 
EDGeo introduces a novel mask-based positional encoding (MPE) scheme that combines spatial coordinates and object silhouettes, enhancing cross-view object localization. By leveraging segmentation masks, the model becomes more "object-aware," improving matching capabilities. Additionally, a context enhancement module (CEM) is designed to address the challenges of large-span objects in satellite imagery by extracting long-range contextual features. Integration of MPE and CEM results in the EDGeo framework, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-view object geo-localization tasks. Experiments on public datasets show a 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy, especially in challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work contributes a robust positional encoding paradigm and contextual modeling framework for advancing research in cross-view geo-localization. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving, urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes, thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware." Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity, which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels, enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach, GMFVAD, for video anomaly detection that leverages multi-modal information to enhance feature extraction and reduce redundancy. By generating grained multi-modal features based on video snippets and incorporating text features from captions, GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. The refinement of features through the diversity among multi-modal information helps in better identifying anomalies in surveillance videos. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of GMFVAD in reducing redundant information and improving anomaly detection accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2510.20268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD). Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets, comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore, we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across different datasets.

Summary:
The article introduces the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN) for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR) image recognition. KINN addresses the trilemma of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency by utilizing electromagnetic scattering features through a compression-aggregation-compression architecture. The framework includes a physics-guided compression stage, an aggregation module, and a semantic compression stage with self-distillation. KINN is implemented in both CNN and Vision Transformer variants with a low parameter count. Evaluation on five SAR benchmarks shows that KINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in parameter-efficient recognition, excelling in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios. It offers high generalization, interpretability, and effectiveness in overcoming the representation trilemma, paving the way for trustworthy AI in SAR image analysis.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR) image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting, optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer (0.95M) variants.

Summary: 
The article introduces a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC$^3$) framework for Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) to address challenges in first-person video understanding. The framework includes a baseline model, a module for generating counterfactual samples, and a contrastive optimization module. Counterfactual samples are created for textual and visual modalities to improve event understanding and hand-object interaction recognition. By incorporating these samples into the baseline and employing contrastive optimization, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple dataset splits, EgoTaskQA, and QAEGO4D. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in enhancing egocentric videoqa tasks.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples. Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the \textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm for enhancing GUI grounding performance by treating instructions as dynamic analytical pathways. By addressing flaws in existing grounding datasets and leveraging instruction diversity, the proposed two-stage training framework (SFT followed by RL) results in state-of-the-art models UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B. These models achieve high accuracy on challenging benchmarks, demonstrating emergent reasoning and the ability to synthesize novel instruction pathways. The analysis highlights the effectiveness of formulating reasoning to improve grounding performance and how the method prevents policy collapse in the SFT+RL framework.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language query. Two obstacles are severe inter-platform heterogeneity and a domain gap between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework: (i) platform-wise partitioning, satellite augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

<div> Keywords: Multi-modal large language models, visual-textual alignment, hyperbolic space, hierarchical levels, efficient training

Summary: 
Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized the alignment of visual and textual understanding. However, their high computational resource demands stem from vision encoders like CLIP and SAM lacking cross-modal alignment at various granularity levels. To address this, a novel approach leveraging hyperbolic space is proposed. The HyperET training paradigm optimizes visual representations to align with text counterparts at any granularity level by dynamically adjusting hyperbolic radius. Utilizing learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication in three configurations - diagonal scaling, block-diagonal, and banded matrices, HyperET efficiently bridges the granularity gap while maintaining flexibility. Extensive experiments across MLLM benchmarks showcase consistent improvements in both pre-training and fine-tuning, with minimal additional parameters. This approach offers a principled and efficient solution for enhancing visual-textual alignment in large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\% additional parameters.

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces AccuQuant, a novel post-training quantization method for diffusion models. It addresses the issue of error accumulation in quantization errors for diffusion models over denoising steps in a sampling process. AccuQuant minimizes discrepancies between full-precision and quantized diffusion model outputs, simulating multiple denoising steps explicitly to account for accumulated errors. Unlike previous approaches, which minimize discrepancies independently for each step, AccuQuant considers the error accumulation problem. The method also includes an efficient implementation technique and a novel objective that significantly reduces memory complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method, dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps. That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard benchmarks.

Summary:
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are leading in visual generation models, with images represented as patch tokens and positional encodings (PEs). Patch tokens show a surprising independence, leading to globally coherent outputs even with perturbed PEs. This indicates that spatial coherence is mostly influenced by PEs. The Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field) extends PEs to a 3D field, incorporating depth-aware and hierarchical encodings for volumetric reasoning and fine-grained control over sub-patches. This augmentation allows DiTs to directly model geometry in 3D space. The PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves top performance in single-image novel view synthesis and enables controllable spatial image editing. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image editing.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel causal approach to improve image-to-recipe retrieval by addressing the limitations of existing methods that fail to capture subtle recipe-specific details. By predicting overlooked culinary elements in images and incorporating them into cross-modal representation learning, biases in dominant visual elements can be mitigated. The proposed approach is tested on both monolingual and multilingual multicultural cuisine datasets, showing impressive retrieval performance. The results suggest that this causal representation learning method is effective in uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions, leading to a more accurate and nuanced understanding of recipes in different cuisines. <div>
arXiv:2510.20393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images, while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual multicultural datasets.

The paper introduces a novel approach, the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, for lung cancer classification by utilizing dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation. Unlike traditional methods, this model adapts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic to focus on high-confidence regions and reduce attention to ambiguous areas, improving the model's ability to handle uncertainty in disease diagnosis.

Computational efficiency is addressed by using Genetic Algorithm to select the most suitable pre-trained student model. Evaluation on two datasets demonstrates high accuracy (99.16% on histopathological images and 99.54% on CT-scan images) and robustness across different imaging domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights, our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic, enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model, which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet, enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000 histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images (99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

arXiv:2510.20470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further. To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification, evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage progressive cold-start strategy combined with an Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and robustness.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the importance of reliable demographic attribute inference (DAI) in evaluating the fairness of face analysis systems (FAS). The reliability of DAI impacts the accuracy and fairness of FAS assessments. A modular transfer learning approach is proposed to improve DAI reliability, combining pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear classification heads. The method is evaluated on accuracy, fairness, and robustness, with a focus on ethnicity, a challenging attribute. Results show superior performance compared to strong baselines. The proposed robustness metric, measuring intra-identity consistency, is a valuable addition to fairness auditing. The research aims to enhance transparency and reproducibility by publicly releasing training dataset metadata, codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation tools. This work establishes a dependable framework for demographic inference in FAS fairness auditing.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.20482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness. To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy, fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

<title>EchoDistill: Bidirectional Concept Distillation for One-Step Diffusion Personalization</title>

arXiv:2510.20512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However, personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP). Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output. Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy, wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Despite this progress, current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries, leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper, we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR. A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context (Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa) framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation. Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks, FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced visual SLAM framework that integrates SuperPoint and LightGlue for robust feature extraction and matching. We evaluated our framework using TUM RGB-D, ICL-NUIM, and TartanAir datasets, which feature diverse and challenging scenarios. SELM-SLAM3 outperforms conventional ORB-SLAM3 by an average of 87.84% and exceeds state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77%. Our framework demonstrates enhanced performance under challenging conditions, such as low-texture scenes and fast motion, providing a reliable platform for developing navigation aids for the visually impaired.

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range, and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color, which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model (GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency. For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks, highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data, model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at https://zterobot.github.io/EmbodiedBrain.github.io.

<title>Open-o3 Video: Grounded Video Reasoning with Explicit Spatio-Temporal Evidence</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20579</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3 have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers, allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets, STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision. On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and improving answer reliability.

<title>GenColorBench: A Color Evaluation Benchmark for Text-to-Image Generation Models</title>

arXiv:2510.20586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11, including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation. The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

arXiv:2510.20596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift, unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging, particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines, consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory and runtime.

<title>SeViCES: Unifying Semantic-Visual Evidence Consensus for Long Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs) can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space. Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection for Video-LLMs.

<title>Deep Learning in Dental Image Analysis: A Systematic Review of Datasets, Methodologies, and Emerging Challenges</title>

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260 studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned 3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution, long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact, frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables (i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii) long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

arXiv:2510.20661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of 100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/UltraHR-100k}{here}.

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization. Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation, inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map (Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps, improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset, HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations, the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities, circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

<title>Efficient Multi-bit Quantization Network Training via Weight Bias Correction and Bit-wise Coreset Sampling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model. However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/EMQNet_jk.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation suite to facilitate future research.

<title>Mixing Importance with Diversity: Joint Optimization for KV Cache Compression in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20707</link>

arXiv:2510.20707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this, we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV} consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency. Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable performance gains.

<title>ALICE-LRI: A General Method for Lossless Range Image Generation for Spinning LiDAR Sensors without Calibration Metadata</title>

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss, compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general, sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits, demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete geometric preservation.

<title>AutoScape: Geometry-Consistent Long-Horizon Scene Generation</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e., rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and 43.0\%, respectively.

Abstract: Automated histopathological image analysis plays a vital role in computer-aided diagnosis of various diseases. Among developed algorithms, deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple tasks, including semantic tissue segmentation in histological images. In this study, we propose a novel approach based on attention-driven feature fusion of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) within a unified dual-encoder model to improve semantic segmentation performance. Evaluation on two publicly available datasets showed that our model achieved {\mu}IoU/{\mu}Dice scores of 76.79%/86.87% on the GCPS dataset and 64.93%/76.60% on the PUMA dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art and baseline benchmarks.

<title>DyPE: Dynamic Position Extrapolation for Ultra High Resolution Diffusion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve. Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation, with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K 256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

<title>CUPID: Pose-Grounded Generative 3D Reconstruction from a Single Image</title>

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space, Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery; and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3 dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity over baseline 3D generative models.

<title>Radar-Camera Fused Multi-Object Tracking: Online Calibration and Common Feature</title>

arXiv:2510.20794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2) the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual traffic scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models, and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter efficient, and interpretable approach.

<title>Small Drafts, Big Verdict: Information-Intensive Visual Reasoning via Speculation</title>

arXiv:2510.20812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K. By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models or training pipelines.

<title>SpectraMorph: Structured Latent Learning for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Super-Resolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects. Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images (HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against supervised baselines.

<title>Towards General Modality Translation with Contrastive and Predictive Latent Diffusion Bridge</title>

arXiv:2510.20819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT), translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis. Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

arXiv:2510.20820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation. Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject personalized image generation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence, HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at: https://holo-cine.github.io/.

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces. The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods, its failure modes, and other limitations.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire, allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92% precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy, offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

Abstract: This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to enable precise quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training. Using video data from Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full range-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26 participants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle trajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived, including range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase durations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for within-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM repetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations, particularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed that participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were the primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \%ROM, which is the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this definition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across exercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from full ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and consistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing research and improving resistance training prescription.

<title>Why Prototypes Collapse: Diagnosing and Preventing Partial Collapse in Prototypical Self-Supervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations -- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure, independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) systems have traditionally relied on structured text data, but the rapid growth of multimedia content (images, audio, video, and structured metadata) has introduced new challenges and opportunities for retrieval-augmented QA. In this survey, we review recent advancements in QA systems that integrate multimedia retrieval pipelines, focusing on architectures that align vision, language, and audio modalities with user queries. We categorize approaches based on retrieval methods, fusion techniques, and answer generation strategies, and analyze benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and performance tradeoffs. Furthermore, we highlight key challenges such as cross-modal alignment, latency-accuracy tradeoffs, and semantic grounding, and outline open problems and future research directions for building more robust and context-aware QA systems leveraging multimedia data.

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent, capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way, compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav". We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image. While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning (GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E) approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks, questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and further resources are publicly available.

<title>MEIcoder: Decoding Visual Stimuli from Neural Activity by Leveraging Most Exciting Inputs</title>

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces. However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging, remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500 neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

<title>Compress to Impress: Efficient LLM Adaptation Using a Single Gradient Step on 100 Samples</title>

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i) Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected -- eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to 24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just 100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over 10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends, uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1) learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Due to their high temporal resolution and large dynamic range, event cameras are uniquely suited for the analysis of time-periodic signals in an image. In this work we present an efficient and fully asynchronous event camera algorithm for detecting the fundamental frequency at which image pixels flicker. The algorithm employs a second-order digital infinite impulse response (IIR) filter to perform an approximate per-pixel brightness reconstruction and is more robust to high-frequency noise than the baseline method we compare to. We further demonstrate that using the falling edge of the signal leads to more accurate period estimates than the rising edge, and that for certain signals interpolating the zero-level crossings can further increase accuracy. Our experiments find that the outstanding capabilities of the camera in detecting frequencies up to 64kHz for a single pixel do not carry over to full sensor imaging as readout bandwidth limitations become a serious obstacle. This suggests that a hardware implementation closer to the sensor will allow for greatly improved frequency imaging. We discuss the important design parameters for fullsensor frequency imaging and present Frequency Cam, an open-source implementation as a ROS node that can run on a single core of a laptop CPU at more than 50 million events per second. It produces results that are qualitatively very similar to those obtained from the closed source vibration analysis module in Prophesee's Metavision Toolkit.

Abstract: Deepfakes, which employ GAN to produce highly realistic facial modification, are widely regarded as the prevailing method. Traditional CNN have been able to identify bogus media, but they struggle to perform well on different datasets and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their lack of robustness. Vision transformers have demonstrated potential in the realm of image classification problems, but they require enough training data. Motivated by these limitations, this publication introduces Tex-ViT (Texture-Vision Transformer), which enhances CNN features by combining ResNet with a vision transformer. The model combines traditional ResNet features with a texture module that operates in parallel on sections of ResNet before each down-sampling operation. The texture module then serves as an input to the dual branch of the cross-attention vision transformer. It specifically focuses on improving the global texture module, which extracts feature map correlation. Empirical analysis reveals that fake images exhibit smooth textures that do not remain consistent over long distances in manipulations. Experiments were performed on different categories of FF++, such as DF, f2f, FS, and NT, together with other types of GAN datasets in cross-domain scenarios. Furthermore, experiments also conducted on FF++, DFDCPreview, and Celeb-DF dataset underwent several post-processing situations, such as blurring, compression, and noise. The model surpassed the most advanced models in terms of generalization, achieving a 98% accuracy in cross-domain scenarios. This demonstrates its ability to learn the shared distinguishing textural characteristics in the manipulated samples. These experiments provide evidence that the proposed model is capable of being applied to various situations and is resistant to many post-processing procedures.

Abstract: Despite their immense success, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be difficult to optimize and costly to train due to hundreds of layers within the network depth. Conventional convolutional operations are fundamentally limited by their linear nature along with fixed activations, where many layers are needed to learn meaningful patterns in data. Because of the sheer size of these networks, this approach is simply computationally inefficient, and poses overfitting or gradient explosion risks, especially in small datasets. As a result, we introduce a "plug-in" module, called Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (RKAN). Our module is highly compact, so it can be easily added into any stage (level) of traditional deep networks, where it learns to integrate supportive polynomial feature transformations to existing convolutional frameworks. RKAN offers consistent improvements over baseline models in different vision tasks and widely tested benchmarks, accomplishing cutting-edge performance on them.

Abstract: Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the implicit scene understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows and inter-reflections. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape, and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or ray-tracing. .

Abstract: Faces and humans are crucial elements in social interaction and are widely included in everyday photos and videos. Therefore, a deep understanding of faces and humans will enable multi-modal assistants to achieve improved response quality and broadened application scope. Currently, the multi-modal assistant community lacks a comprehensive and scientific evaluation of face and human understanding abilities. In this paper, we first propose a hierarchical ability taxonomy that includes three levels of abilities. Then, based on this taxonomy, we collect images and annotations from publicly available datasets in the face and human community and build a semi-automatic data pipeline to produce problems for the new benchmark. Finally, the obtained Face-Human-Bench includes a development set and a test set, each with 1800 problems, supporting both English and Chinese. We conduct evaluations over 25 mainstream multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with our Face-Human-Bench, focusing on the correlation between abilities, the impact of the relative position of targets on performance, and the impact of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting on performance. We also explore which abilities of MLLMs need to be supplemented by specialist models. The dataset and evaluation code have been made publicly available at https://face-human-bench.github.io.

Abstract: We present a novel video generation framework that integrates 3-dimensional geometry and dynamic awareness. To achieve this, we augment 2D videos with 3D point trajectories and align them in pixel space. The resulting 3D-aware video dataset, PointVid, is then used to fine-tune a latent diffusion model, enabling it to track 2D objects with 3D Cartesian coordinates. Building on this, we regularize the shape and motion of objects in the video to eliminate undesired artifacts, e.g., non-physical deformation. Consequently, we enhance the quality of generated RGB videos and alleviate common issues like object morphing, which are prevalent in current video models due to a lack of shape awareness. With our 3D augmentation and regularization, our model is capable of handling contact-rich scenarios such as task-oriented videos, where 3D information is essential for perceiving shape and motion of interacting solids. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing video diffusion models to improve their visual plausibility.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of weakly supervised cross-view localization, where the goal is to estimate the pose of a ground camera relative to a satellite image with noisy ground truth annotations. A common approach to bridge the cross-view domain gap for pose estimation is Bird's-Eye View (BEV) synthesis. However, existing methods struggle with height ambiguity due to the lack of depth information in ground images and satellite height maps. Previous solutions either assume a flat ground plane or rely on complex models, such as cross-view transformers. We propose BevSplat, a novel method that resolves height ambiguity by using feature-based Gaussian primitives. Each pixel in the ground image is represented by a 3D Gaussian with semantic and spatial features, which are synthesized into a BEV feature map for relative pose estimation. Additionally, to address challenges with panoramic query images, we introduce an icosphere-based supervision strategy for the Gaussian primitives. We validate our method on the widely used KITTI and VIGOR datasets, which include both pinhole and panoramic query images. Experimental results show that BevSplat significantly improves localization accuracy over prior approaches.

Abstract: Automated livestock monitoring is crucial for precision farming, but robust computer vision models are hindered by a lack of datasets reflecting real-world group challenges. We introduce the 8-Calves dataset, a challenging benchmark for multi-animal detection, tracking, and identification. It features a one-hour video of eight Holstein Friesian calves in a barn, with frequent occlusions, motion blur, and diverse poses. A semi-automated pipeline using a fine-tuned YOLOv8 detector and ByteTrack, followed by manual correction, provides over 537,000 bounding boxes with temporal identity labels.
  We benchmark 28 object detectors, showing near-perfect performance on a lenient IoU threshold (mAP50: 95.2-98.9%) but significant divergence on stricter metrics (mAP50:95: 56.5-66.4%), highlighting fine-grained localization challenges. Our identification benchmark across 23 models reveals a trade-off: scaling model size improves classification accuracy but compromises retrieval. Smaller architectures like ConvNextV2 Nano achieve the best balance (73.35% accuracy, 50.82% Top-1 KNN). Pre-training focused on semantic learning (e.g., BEiT) yielded superior transferability. For tracking, leading methods achieve high detection accuracy (MOTA > 0.92) but struggle with identity preservation (IDF1 $\approx$ 0.27), underscoring a key challenge in occlusion-heavy scenarios.
  The 8-Calves dataset bridges a gap by providing temporal richness and realistic challenges, serving as a resource for advancing agricultural vision models. The dataset and code are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tonyFang04/8-calves.

Abstract: Modern image restoration and super-resolution methods utilize deep learning due to its superior performance compared to traditional algorithms. However, deep learning typically requires large training datasets, which are rarely available in astrophotography. Deep Image Prior (DIP) bypasses this constraint by performing blind training on a single image. Although effective in some cases, DIP often suffers from overfitting, artifact generation, and instability. To overcome these issues and improve general performance, this work proposes DIPLI - a framework that shifts from single-frame to multi-frame training using the Back Projection technique, combined with optical flow estimation via the TVNet model, and replaces deterministic predictions with unbiased Monte Carlo estimation obtained through Langevin dynamics. A comprehensive evaluation compares the method against Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique still widely used in astronomical image reconstruction, DIP, the transformer-based model RVRT, and the diffusion-based model DiffIR2VR-Zero. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate consistent improvements, with the method outperforming baselines for SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and DISTS metrics in the majority of cases. In addition to superior reconstruction quality, the model also requires far fewer input images than Lucky Imaging and is less prone to overfitting or artifact generation. Evaluation on real-world astronomical data, where domain shifts typically hinder generalization, shows that the method maintains high reconstruction quality, confirming practical robustness.

Abstract: The growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical domains such as healthcare demands robust mechanisms to ensure the trustworthiness of these systems, especially when faced with unexpected or anomalous inputs. This paper introduces the Open Medical Imaging Benchmarks for Out-Of-Distribution Detection (OpenMIBOOD), a comprehensive framework for evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods specifically in medical imaging contexts. OpenMIBOOD includes three benchmarks from diverse medical domains, encompassing 14 datasets divided into covariate-shifted in-distribution, near-OOD, and far-OOD categories. We evaluate 24 post-hoc methods across these benchmarks, providing a standardized reference to advance the development and fair comparison of OOD detection methods. Results reveal that findings from broad-scale OOD benchmarks in natural image domains do not translate to medical applications, underscoring the critical need for such benchmarks in the medical field. By mitigating the risk of exposing AI models to inputs outside their training distribution, OpenMIBOOD aims to support the advancement of reliable and trustworthy AI systems in healthcare.

Abstract: Existing autonomous driving datasets are predominantly oriented towards well-structured urban settings and favourable weather conditions, leaving the complexities of rural environments and adverse weather conditions largely unaddressed. Although some datasets encompass variations in weather and lighting, bad weather scenarios do not appear often. Rainfall can significantly impair sensor functionality, introducing noise and reflections in LiDAR and camera data and reducing the system's capabilities for reliable environmental perception and safe navigation. This paper introduces the Panoptic-CUDAL dataset, a novel dataset purpose-built for panoptic segmentation in rural areas subject to rain. By recording high-resolution LiDAR, camera, and pose data, Panoptic-CUDAL offers a diverse, information-rich dataset in a challenging scenario. We present the analysis of the recorded data and provide baseline results for panoptic, semantic segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction methods on LiDAR point clouds.

Abstract: Current image fusion methods struggle to address the composite degradations encountered in real-world imaging scenarios and lack the flexibility to accommodate user-specific requirements. In response to these challenges, we propose a controllable image fusion framework with language-vision prompts, termed ControlFusion, which adaptively neutralizes composite degradations. On the one hand, we develop a degraded imaging model that integrates physical imaging mechanisms, including the Retinex theory and atmospheric scattering principle, to simulate composite degradations, thereby providing potential for addressing real-world complex degradations from the data level. On the other hand, we devise a prompt-modulated restoration and fusion network that dynamically enhances features with degradation prompts, enabling our method to accommodate composite degradation of varying levels. Specifically, considering individual variations in quality perception of users, we incorporate a text encoder to embed user-specified degradation types and severity levels as degradation prompts. We also design a spatial-frequency collaborative visual adapter that autonomously perceives degradations in source images, thus eliminating the complete dependence on user instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ControlFusion outperforms SOTA fusion methods in fusion quality and degradation handling, particularly in countering real-world and compound degradations with various levels.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation aims to synthesize novel scenes that faithfully preserve subject identity from reference images while adhering to textual guidance. However, existing methods struggle with a critical trade-off between fidelity and efficiency. Tuning-based approaches rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive, subject-specific optimization, while zero-shot methods often fail to maintain adequate subject consistency. In this work, we propose FreeGraftor, a training-free framework that addresses these limitations through cross-image feature grafting. Specifically, FreeGraftor leverages semantic matching and position-constrained attention fusion to transfer visual details from reference subjects to the generated images. Additionally, our framework introduces a novel noise initialization strategy to preserve the geometry priors of reference subjects, facilitating robust feature matching. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method enables precise subject identity transfer while maintaining text-aligned scene synthesis. Without requiring model fine-tuning or additional training, FreeGraftor significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and training-free approaches in both subject fidelity and text alignment. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly extend to multi-subject generation, making it practical for real-world deployment. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nihukat/FreeGraftor.

Abstract: Hands are essential to human interaction, and exploring contact between hands and the world can promote comprehensive understanding of their function. Recently, there have been growing number of hand interaction datasets that cover interaction with object, other hand, scene, and body. Despite the significance of the task and increasing high-quality data, how to effectively learn dense hand contact estimation remains largely underexplored. There are two major challenges for learning dense hand contact estimation. First, there exists class imbalance issue from hand contact datasets where majority of regions are not in contact. Second, hand contact datasets contain spatial imbalance issue with most of hand contact exhibited in finger tips, resulting in challenges for generalization towards contacts in other hand regions. To tackle these issues, we present a framework that learns dense HAnd COntact estimation (HACO) from imbalanced data. To resolve the class imbalance issue, we introduce balanced contact sampling, which builds and samples from multiple sampling groups that fairly represent diverse contact statistics for both contact and non-contact vertices. Moreover, to address the spatial imbalance issue, we propose vertex-level class-balanced (VCB) loss, which incorporates spatially varying contact distribution by separately reweighting loss contribution of each vertex based on its contact frequency across dataset. As a result, we effectively learn to predict dense hand contact estimation with large-scale hand contact data without suffering from class and spatial imbalance issue. The codes are available at https://github.com/dqj5182/HACO_RELEASE.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-video retrieval has been largely driven by contrastive learning. However, existing methods often overlook the effect of the modality gap, which causes anchor representations to undergo in-place optimization (i.e., optimization tension) that limits their alignment capacity. Moreover, noisy hard negatives further distort the semantics of anchors. To address these issues, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces a learnable, pair-specific increment $\Delta_{ij}$ between text $t_i$ and video $v_j$, redistributing gradients to relieve optimization tension and absorb noise. We derive $\Delta_{ij}$ via a multivariate first-order Taylor expansion of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, showing that it guides updates along locally consistent descent directions. A lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic gap couples increments across batches for structure-aware correction. Furthermore, we regularize $\Delta$ through a variational information bottleneck with relaxed compression, enhancing stability and semantic consistency. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that GARE consistently improves alignment accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation. Code is available at https://github.com/musicman217/GARE-text-video-retrieval.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have gained widespread application across various domains, demonstrating remarkable creative potential. However, the strong generalization capabilities of diffusion models can inadvertently lead to the generation of not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, posing significant risks to their safe deployment. While several concept erasure methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue associated with NSFW content, a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness across various scenarios remains absent. To bridge this gap, we introduce a full-pipeline toolkit specifically designed for concept erasure and conduct the first systematic study of NSFW concept erasure methods. By examining the interplay between the underlying mechanisms and empirical observations, we provide in-depth insights and practical guidance for the effective application of concept erasure methods in various real-world scenarios, with the aim of advancing the understanding of content safety in diffusion models and establishing a solid foundation for future research and development in this critical area.

Abstract: Existing pretrained models for 3D mesh generation often suffer from data biases and produce low-quality results, while global reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on object-level rewards that struggle to capture local structure details. To address these challenges, we present Mesh-RFT, a novel fine-grained reinforcement fine-tuning framework that employs Masked Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable localized refinement via quality-aware face masking. To facilitate efficient quality evaluation, we introduce an objective topology-aware scoring system to evaluate geometric integrity and topological regularity at both object and face levels through two metrics: Boundary Edge Ratio (BER) and Topology Score (TS). By integrating these metrics into a fine-grained RL strategy, Mesh-RFT becomes the first method to optimize mesh quality at the granularity of individual faces, resolving localized errors while preserving global coherence. Experiment results show that our M-DPO approach reduces Hausdorff Distance (HD) by 24.6% and improves Topology Score (TS) by 3.8% over pre-trained models, while outperforming global DPO methods with a 17.4% HD reduction and 4.9% TS gain. These results demonstrate Mesh-RFT's ability to improve geometric integrity and topological regularity, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in production-ready mesh generation.

Abstract: Earth observation foundation models have shown strong generalization across multiple Earth observation tasks, but their robustness under real-world perturbations remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce REOBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of Earth observation foundation models across six tasks and twelve types of image corruptions, including both appearance-based and geometric perturbations. To ensure realistic and fine-grained evaluation, our benchmark focuses on high-resolution optical remote sensing images, which are widely used in critical applications such as urban planning and disaster response. We conduct a systematic evaluation of a broad range of models trained using masked image modeling, contrastive learning, and vision-language pre-training paradigms. Our results reveal that (1) existing Earth observation foundation models experience significant performance degradation when exposed to input corruptions. (2) The severity of degradation varies across tasks, model architectures, backbone sizes, and types of corruption, with performance drop varying from less than 1% to over 20%. (3) Vision-language models show enhanced robustness, particularly in multimodal tasks. REOBench underscores the vulnerability of current Earth observation foundation models to real-world corruptions and provides actionable insights for developing more robust and reliable models. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/lx709/REOBench.

<title>MODEM: A Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism for Adverse Weather Image Recovery</title>

Abstract: Restoring images degraded by adverse weather remains a significant challenge due to the highly non-uniform and spatially heterogeneous nature of weather-induced artifacts, e.g., fine-grained rain streaks versus widespread haze. Accurately estimating the underlying degradation can intuitively provide restoration models with more targeted and effective guidance, enabling adaptive processing strategies. To this end, we propose a Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism (MODEM) for adverse weather image restoration. Central to MODEM is the Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module (MOS2D), which integrates Morton-coded spatial ordering with selective state-space models to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local structural coherence. Complementing MOS2D, we introduce a Dual Degradation Estimation Module (DDEM) that disentangles and estimates both global and local degradation priors. These priors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and context-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex degradation dynamics. Our code will be released at https://github.com/hainuo-wang/MODEM.git.

Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise-rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-rays, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail. Additional visualizations, tutorials, and code are available at https://polypose.csail.mit.edu.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2025 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 17 mAP!

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across multi-modal tasks by encoding images into thousands of tokens. However, the large number of image tokens results in significant computational overhead, and the use of dynamic high-resolution inputs further increases this burden. Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens through token pruning, typically by selecting tokens based on attention scores or image token diversity. Through empirical studies, we observe that existing methods often overlook the joint impact of pruning on both the current layer's output (local) and the outputs of subsequent layers (global), leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. To address this challenge, we propose Balanced Token Pruning (BTP), a plug-and-play method for pruning vision tokens. Specifically, our method utilizes a small calibration set to divide the pruning process into multiple stages. In the early stages, our method emphasizes the impact of pruning on subsequent layers, whereas in the deeper stages, the focus shifts toward preserving the consistency of local outputs. Extensive experiments across various LVLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmarks. Our method achieves a 78% compression rate while preserving 96.7% of the original models' performance on average. Our code is available at https://github.com/EmbodiedCity/NeurIPS2025-Balanced-Token-Pruning.

Abstract: Reasoning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising performance on complex multimodal tasks. However, they still face significant challenges: they are highly sensitive to reasoning errors, require large volumes of annotated data or accurate verifiers, and struggle to generalize beyond specific domains. To address these limitations, we explore self-correction as a strategy to enhance reasoning VLMs. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of reasoning VLMs' self-correction abilities and identify key gaps. Based on our findings, we introduce Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement training framework. Sherlock introduces a trajectory-level self-correction objective, a preference data construction method based on visual perturbation, and a dynamic $\beta$ for preference tuning. Once the model acquires self-correction capabilities using only 20k randomly sampled annotated data, it continues to self-improve without external supervision. Built on the Llama3.2-Vision-11B model, Sherlock achieves remarkable results across eight benchmarks, reaching an average accuracy of 64.1 with direct generation and 65.4 after self-correction. It outperforms LLaVA-CoT (63.2), Mulberry (63.9), and LlamaV-o1 (63.4) while using less than 20% of the annotated data.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in a wide range of applications, including urban planning and environmental monitoring. However, due to limitations in sensors and data transmission links, the images acquired in practice often suffer from resolution degradation. Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution (RSISR) aims to reconstruct HR images from low-resolution (LR) inputs, providing a cost-effective and efficient alternative to direct HR image acquisition. Existing RSISR methods primarily focus on low-level characteristics in pixel space, while neglecting the high-level understanding of remote sensing scenes. This may lead to semantically inconsistent artifacts in the reconstructed results. Motivated by this observation, our work aims to explore the role of high-level semantic knowledge in improving RSISR performance. We propose a Semantic-Guided Super-Resolution framework, SeG-SR, which leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract semantic knowledge from input images and uses it to guide the super resolution (SR) process. Specifically, we first design a Semantic Feature Extraction Module (SFEM) that utilizes a pretrained VLM to extract semantic knowledge from remote sensing images. Next, we propose a Semantic Localization Module (SLM), which derives a series of semantic guidance from the extracted semantic knowledge. Finally, we develop a Learnable Modulation Module (LMM) that uses semantic guidance to modulate the features extracted by the SR network, effectively incorporating high-level scene understanding into the SR pipeline. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of SeG-SR through extensive experiments: SeG-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, and consistently improves performance across various SR architectures. Notably, for the x4 SR task on UCMerced dataset, it attained a PSNR of 29.3042 dB and an SSIM of 0.7961.

Abstract: Audio-visual event parsing plays a crucial role in understanding multimodal video content, but existing methods typically rely on offline processing of entire videos with huge model sizes, limiting their real-time applicability. We introduce Online Audio-Visual Event Parsing (On-AVEP), a novel paradigm for parsing audio, visual, and audio-visual events by sequentially analyzing incoming video streams. The On-AVEP task necessitates models with two key capabilities: (1) Accurate online inference, to effectively distinguish events with unclear and limited context in online settings, and (2) Real-time efficiency, to balance high performance with computational constraints. To cultivate these, we propose the Predictive Future Modeling (PreFM) framework featured by (a) predictive multimodal future modeling to infer and integrate beneficial future audio-visual cues, thereby enhancing contextual understanding and (b) modality-agnostic robust representation along with focal temporal prioritization to improve precision and generalization. Extensive experiments on the UnAV-100 and LLP datasets show PreFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly fewer parameters, offering an insightful approach for real-time multimodal video understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/XiaoYu-1123/PreFM.

Abstract: Foundation models trained at scale exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors, learning new capabilities beyond their initial training objectives. We find such emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive vision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M, comprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse biological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various biological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We identify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At the inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns closely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the intra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better separated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide formal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and contrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties. Crucially, our results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant with larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding space.

Abstract: Pre-trained encoders for offline feature extraction followed by multiple instance learning (MIL) aggregators have become the dominant paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), benefiting cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results. These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath and calls for greater research focus in this area. The code is https://github.com/DearCaat/E2E-WSI-ABMILX.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance.

Abstract: Organ segmentation of plant point clouds is a prerequisite for the high-resolution and accurate extraction of organ-level phenotypic traits. Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF), aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%, 17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the second-best results on structurally complex species. More importantly, PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance segmentation tasks. Across all plant species, it achieved average improvements of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively. This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of large-scale models in plant science.

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks. ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances. iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities, generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours, accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences, facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model, MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings. The code is available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FDAM.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated. The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at https://github.com/Elman295/TCSSM.

<title>ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding. Code is available at https://github.com/KangJialiang/ViSpec.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2) decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies (LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising 22 generative models. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/xigua7105/FerretNet.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation (JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms for VLMs.

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in the wild.

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) by enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains, applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset consisting of 2,757 whole-body PET/CT volumes from independent patients and their corresponding full-length clinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, especially for low-resource languages and clinical use in Vietnamese healthcare.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements, particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis, cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73 to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc, achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels, avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71 mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene understanding.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a major obstacle to model generalization. To address this challenge from a data-centric perspective, this paper introduces a profile extraction and discovery framework for characterizing the style profiles underlying both synthetic and real image datasets. We propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a standardized profiling-based quality control paradigm that enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload. Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work of academic research, we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled, scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities. Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users. Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing multi-modal walking assistance.

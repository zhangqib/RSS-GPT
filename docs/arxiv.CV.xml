<div> Keywords: Binarized Change Detection, Binary Neural Network, Information Bottleneck, Detection Performance, State-of-the-art

Summary: 
BiCD introduces a binary neural network (BNN) for change detection, addressing limitations of conventional binarization approaches. By incorporating an auxiliary objective based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, BiCD enhances the representation and feature separability of BNNs, leading to improved detection accuracy. The auxiliary module serves as an approximation target for calculating mutual information, enabling the optimization strategy to minimize both reconstruction loss and change detection loss. Experimental results on street-view and remote sensing datasets demonstrate BiCD's effectiveness, establishing a new benchmark for BNN-based change detection and achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions. This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this domain.

Abstract: Brain stroke is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, underscoring the need for precise and rapid prediction techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. Most stroke classification techniques use a single slice-level prediction mechanism, requiring radiologists to manually select the most critical CT slice from the original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques, this study investigates machine learning models for early brain stroke prediction using CT scan images. This research proposes a novel machine learning approach to brain stroke detection, focusing on optimizing classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are used for feature extraction. Feature engineering techniques, including BFO, PCA, and LDA, further enhance model performance. These features are then classified using machine learning algorithms, including SVC, RF, XGB, DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of 97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

Summary: The article introduces EEG-VJEPA, a novel approach for EEG classification that utilizes the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). By treating EEG signals as video-like sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns spatiotemporal representations effectively. It addresses the challenges of limited labeled data and high dimensionality in EEG analysis. The model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, while also capturing physiologically relevant spatial and temporal signal patterns. This provides interpretable embeddings that can enhance human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. Overall, EEG-VJEPA shows promise for scalable and trustworthy EEG analysis in real-world clinical settings. <br /> <div>

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy. Beyond classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in real-world clinical settings.

<div> Keywords: pre-trained diffusion models, generative inverse rendering, image conditioning, intrinsic prediction, flow matching

Summary: 
DNF-Intrinsic is a novel approach to inverse rendering that aims to improve the quality of results by directly predicting intrinsic properties from the source image rather than relying on noisy input. By utilizing flow matching and a generative renderer to ensure physical fidelity, DNF-Intrinsic outperforms existing methods in both synthetic and real-world datasets. The method fine-tunes a pre-trained diffusion model to efficiently predict deterministic intrinsic properties, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the inverse rendering process. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional noise-to-intrinsic mapping methods, which often struggle to produce high-quality results due to the reliance on noisy images. DNF-Intrinsic leverages structure and appearance information in the source image to achieve superior performance in generative inverse rendering tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.03924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching. Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:  
- The approach presented in the article is a diffusion-based method for portrait shadow removal, which aims to produce high-quality results by treating shadow removal as a form of inpainting.  
- A shadow-independent structure extraction network is trained on a portrait dataset to generate a structure map that includes facial details and excludes unwanted shadow boundaries.  
- A structure-guided inpainting diffusion model is then trained using the structure map to remove shadows in a generative manner.  
- A detail restoration diffusion model is used to refine the shadow removal result by restoring fine-scale details that may not be captured in the structure map.  
- Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods and addresses common issues such as facial identity tampering, shadow residuals, color distortion, structure blurring, and loss of details.

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based portrait shadow removal approach that can robustly produce high-fidelity results. Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes, moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and loss of details.

Summary: 
RIPE is a reinforcement learning-based framework designed for weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor. It requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images represent the same scene, allowing for expanded training data. The framework utilizes encoder's intermediate layers and a hyper-column approach to describe keypoints, enhancing the learned descriptors' discriminative capability. An auxiliary loss further improves performance. RIPE simplifies data preparation and achieves competitive results on standard benchmarks. The framework marks a significant advancement in robust keypoint extraction and description. The code is publicly available, facilitating further research. <div>
arXiv:2507.04839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both detection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust keypoint extractor.
  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the discriminative capability of the learned descriptors.
  Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust keypoint extraction and description. To support further research, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/RIPE.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy. Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text, significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks, MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering, 15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8% improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP. MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream applications.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors address the issue of viewpoint sensitivity in Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE) by introducing a generalized scenario called V2-VLNCE. They propose a method called View Invariant Learning (VIL) that enhances the robustness of navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint by learning sparse and view-invariant features through a contrastive learning framework. Additionally, they introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module to improve knowledge transfer between view-dependent and view-invariant models. Their end-to-end training paradigm optimizes these components jointly, resulting in superior performance on V2-VLNCE benchmarks R2R-CE and RxR-CE. The results demonstrate that VIL does not compromise standard viewpoint performance and can be easily integrated as a post-training method. VIL also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging RxR-CE dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in improving navigation in varied viewpoints. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data. It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at: https://github.com/MahdiyarMM/PRISM.

Summary: 
Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from images is a challenging task due to its inherent ambiguity. Existing methods either focus on temporal information or kinematic relationships, but not both. The proposed HMR-ViT model combines both aspects by constructing a Temporal-kinematic Feature Image using an image encoder and a Channel Rearranging Matrix (CRM) to arrange similar kinematic features spatially. The feature image is then processed using a Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are inferred through a regression network. Evaluation on datasets like 3DPW and Human3.6M shows that the HMR-ViT method achieves competitive performance in human mesh recovery. <div>

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

<div> Keywords: Neural Radiance Fields, Material Point Method, granular material properties, Bayesian optimization, inverse analysis <br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel framework that combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material properties from visual observations. Synthetic experimental data is generated by simulating a plow interacting with sand, which is then rendered into realistic images for analysis. The 3D geometry is reconstructed using NeRF from initial multi-view images, and this geometry is used to initialize material point positions for MPM simulation to estimate the friction angle. By comparing rendered simulation images with observed images, Bayesian optimization is employed to minimize image loss and estimate the friction angle accurately. The results show that the friction angle can be estimated within 2 degrees, indicating the effectiveness of using purely visual observations for inverse analysis.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations. These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA) have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify, understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

<div> contrastive loss, class-conditional image synthesis, long-tailed distribution, diffusion models, diversity enhancement

Summary:
Contrastive loss functions are introduced to address the issue of mode collapse and reduced diversity in class-conditional image synthesis with imbalanced training data. The first unsupervised InfoNCE loss increases dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for tail classes, while the second MSE loss contrasts class-conditional with unconditional generation to enrich tail classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. This approach, leveraging conditional-unconditional alignment in diffusion models, enhances performance in long-tailed GAN scenarios. The framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard DDPM and alternative methods across various datasets. <div>
arXiv:2507.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions. Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and ImageNetLT.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding. However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence, tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical, albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand, and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI, research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms. Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

Summary:
BlindSight introduces a training-free method to enhance VLM inference by utilizing sparsity in attention patterns. By categorizing attention heads based on input templates, BlindSight reduces FLOPs by 32%-41% across various VLMs while maintaining comparable accuracy. The analysis of attention patterns in VLMs reveals sparse attention categories like sink-only, document mask, and hybrid document-sink mask. BlindSight leverages these patterns to optimize inference in models such as Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and Gemma-3. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BlindSight in multi-image understanding benchmarks, showcasing improvements in efficiency without compromising performance. <div>
arXiv:2507.09071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated multi-image understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques, from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods (e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models (e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

<div> flow extraction, self-supervised video models, future frame prediction, generative video models, counterfactual prompting 

Summary:
Extracting optical flow from videos using frozen self-supervised video models trained for future frame prediction is explored in this study. By leveraging the Counterfactual World Model paradigm, the authors propose a novel test-time procedure called KL-tracing. This method involves injecting a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolling out the model, and computing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and unperturbed predictive distributions. The success of zero-shot flow extraction is attributed to three key model properties: distributional prediction of future frames, factorized latents treating each patch independently, and random-access decoding. The Local Random Access Sequence architecture, with these properties, outperforms existing models on real-world and synthetic datasets without flow-specific fine-tuning. These results suggest that counterfactual prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective approach for high-quality flow extraction. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem. Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm, which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture. Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces RadEyeVideo, a novel approach that integrates radiologists' eye-fixation data as a video sequence to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics of their gaze. This method enhances human-computer interaction in chest X-ray analysis by considering the sequential order of eye movements. When applied to CXR report generation and disease diagnosis tasks using general-domain LVLMs with video input capabilities, RadEyeVideo boosts model performance by up to 24.6% and an average of 15.2% across both tasks. Remarkably, incorporating eye-gaze videos enables an open-domain LVLM, LLaVA-OneVision, to outperform task-specific medical LVLMs like MAIRA-2 and CheXagent trained on large Chest X-ray data. This demonstrates the significant enhancement in performance that can be achieved by integrating domain expert knowledge, such as eye-gaze information, with LVLMs in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo represents a scalable approach towards employing LVLMs in medical image analytics.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists' eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case), when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image analytics.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces PointSD, a framework that utilizes the Stable Diffusion (SD) model for enhancing 3D self-supervised learning. By adapting the SD model with a 3D encoder, a point-to-image diffusion model is trained to denoise rendered noisy images using point clouds as guidance. This approach allows for extracting SD features from noise-free images and point clouds, aiding in training a 3D backbone for direct semantic learning. Experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of using the SD model in improving point cloud self-supervised learning tasks. The code for PointSD is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point cloud self-supervised learning.

<div> pose representation, diffusion models, sign language production, real-time tasks, attention mechanism

Summary: 
Researchers have developed a new approach that combines autoregressive and diffusion models for sign language production (SLP). This hybrid model leverages the strengths of both methods, allowing for sequential dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture detailed body movements, a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module extracts features from different articulators and integrates them using a Multi-Scale Fusion module. Additionally, a Confidence-Aware Causal Attention mechanism uses confidence scores to guide the pose generation process, enhancing accuracy and robustness. Experiments conducted on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in generating high-quality sign language output and improving real-time streaming efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2507.09105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it, we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming efficiency.

We systematically analyze existing models in the related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models. Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring additional replay data.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours, accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences, facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model, MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen.

<div> Keywords: Human pose estimation, language-guided approach, Large Language Model (LLM), nonlinear MLP, localization accuracy <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces PoseLLM, a novel pose estimation framework that enhances localization accuracy using a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. Unlike traditional methods, PoseLLM leverages language descriptions for keypoint localization, allowing for zero-shot generalization to unseen poses and keypoints. By incorporating a two-layer MLP with GELU activation, PoseLLM facilitates complex spatial-textual interactions, improving the fusion of visual and textual information. Trained solely on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves a performance of 77.8 AP on the COCO validation set, surpassing previous approaches like LocLLM. Furthermore, PoseLLM demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on datasets such as Human-Art and MPII. The results showcase the efficacy of a simple yet powerful nonlinear connector in advancing the state-of-the-art in language-guided pose estimation. The code for PoseLLM is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation, enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions. Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in language-guided pose estimation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces $I^{2}$-World, a framework for efficient 4D occupancy forecasting in 3D scenes to address challenges in autonomous driving systems. The method utilizes intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers, employing a multi-scale residual quantization strategy for scene compression. The encoder-decoder architecture allows for high-level control and temporal consistency during scene generation. $I^{2}$-World outperforms existing methods in mIoU and IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting and demonstrates exceptional computational efficiency with real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

Summary:
Stable Score Distillation (SSD) is a new framework that improves text-guided image and 3D editing by enhancing stability and alignment while reducing complexity. By anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt, SSD achieves cross-prompt alignment using the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation.

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models, yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation (SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt. Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution for text-guided editing.

Summary:<br />
This paper investigates the challenges of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) and the effectiveness of prompt pool methods in addressing them. The study reveals a performance degradation in FSCIL tasks due to token-dimension saturation, which leads to model overfitting. To combat this issue, the authors propose LGSP-Prompt, which uses spatial prompts generated from local and global features to highlight key patterns in input images. Two spatial prompt pools are created to enable dynamic prompt selection for preserving base knowledge and facilitating incremental learning. Experimental results demonstrate that LGSP-Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of data scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. The implementation of LGSP-Prompt is publicly available for further exploration.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks, revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding, we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental learning.

<div> Rotary Position Encoding, Multimodal Alignment, Large Vision Language Models, Image Alignment Bias, MCA-LLaVA

Summary:
Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) can lead to image alignment bias due to long-term decay, causing uneven perception of image tokens. This bias results in inadequate image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment, leading to hallucinations in LVLMs. To address this issue, a new method called MCA-LLaVA is proposed, utilizing Manhattan distance for positional modeling in a two-dimensional space to enhance instruction's perception of image tokens at different spatial locations. By integrating one-dimensional sequence order with two-dimensional spatial position of image tokens, MCA-LLaVA effectively mitigates image alignment bias and reduces hallucinations in LVLMs. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of MCA-LLaVA in improving multimodal alignment in LVLMs. The code for implementing MCA-LLaVA is available on GitHub for further exploration and application.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment. We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code can be accessed in https://github.com/ErikZ719/MCA-LLaVA.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME) approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular, THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation. Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress, current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance (Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG, with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for clinical use.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces the Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm to enhance the generalization ability of 3D detection models for anomaly objects. The algorithm decouples the training of 3D and 2D models to improve generalization for arbitrary 3D foreground detection and introduces an anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction. To address the lack of diversity in training samples, the paper introduces the KITTI-AR dataset, which includes augmented reality stereo images for training and evaluation. The dataset includes common categories for training and rare categories for evaluating 3D anomaly detection in zero-shot scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and dataset, showing improved performance in detecting anomaly objects in 3D environments. The code and dataset are available for further research and development. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving, with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road, 3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm, which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue. Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be obtained at https://github.com/xxxx/xxx).

Summary: 
- Point tracking is crucial for various applications and is typically done offline but is also needed in online settings. 
- Visual foundation models can provide useful initializations for tracking but dedicated design is necessary for online long-term tracking.
- Track-On, a transformer-based model, treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames sequentially without future information.
- Track-On achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven public benchmarks for long-term tracking in an online setting.
- Memory is necessary to maintain coherence over time in causal regimes for long-term tracking without access to future frames. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

<div> transfer learning, distribution shift, confidence misalignment, computer vision, medical imaging

Summary:
StaRFM addresses distribution shift and confidence misalignment challenges in deploying foundation models like CLIP and SAM for computer vision and medical segmentation tasks. It introduces a Fisher information penalty (FIP) and a confidence misalignment penalty (CMP) to improve generalization and uncertainty calibration, respectively. The FIP controls generalization by reducing covariate shift in embeddings, while the CMP minimizes calibration error for voxel-level predictions. The framework shows significant performance improvements on various datasets, including vision datasets like ImageNet and medical segmentation datasets like BraTS. StaRFM achieves higher accuracy, lower error rates, and reduced cross-domain performance gaps compared to prior methods. The framework is easy to integrate with existing models, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions, calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19 vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration with foundation models. Code and models will be released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/StaRFM-C0CD/README.md

<div> reconstruction, telepresence, egocentric, generative backbone, animatable avatars

Summary: 
The article discusses the importance of accurately replicating a person's body, clothing, and movements for an ideal digital telepresence experience. It highlights the challenges of capturing and transferring movements into virtual reality from an egocentric perspective, which does not rely on front-view cameras. The study introduces a novel approach using a generative prior-based method to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs. By leveraging Stable Diffusion, the method reduces training burden and improves generalizability. The research is inspired by existing methods for 360-degree reconstruction from a frontal image, and introduces a pipeline that generates realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images. The ultimate goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic frontal representation and use it to generate avatar motions through an image-to-motion model. This approach aims to make telepresence systems more accessible and generalizable. <div>

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted, which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views, and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs. Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However, most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset (PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes. Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering new insights into computational creativity and art education.

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g. associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose \textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces \textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM), which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust emotion recognition in complex settings.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge. This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning, effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets, considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The code and model checkpoints for this research are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/AAHR .

<div> segment-aware visual tokenization, sign language translation, cross-modal alignment, token-to-token contrastive alignment, PHOENIX14T benchmark<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a segment-aware visual tokenization framework that reduces input sequence length by up to 50% compared to previous methods in sign language translation without relying on gloss annotations. By leveraging sign segmentation, the framework achieves lower memory usage and better scalability on larger datasets. A token-to-token contrastive alignment objective and dual-level supervision are introduced to improve cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic modalities without gloss-level supervision. The proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark while reducing sequence length significantly. Experiments also show improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence lengths, validating the effectiveness of the tokenization and alignment strategies. <div>
arXiv:2507.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands, raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective, along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths, validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

<div> Keywords: Spiking Neural Networks, computer vision, knowledge distillation, cross-modality, cross-architecture 

Summary:<br /><br />
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown promise in computer vision tasks due to their biological plausibility and energy efficiency. However, the lack of annotated event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures have limited their performance compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To improve SNN performance with DVS data, this paper proposes a method called cross knowledge distillation (CKD). CKD leverages RGB data and ANNs to enhance SNNs by addressing cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges. The approach incorporates semantic similarity and sliding replacement to tackle cross-modality issues and uses phased knowledge distillation for cross-architecture challenges. Experimental results on popular neuromorphic datasets like N-Caltech101 and CEP-DVS demonstrate that the proposed CKD method outperforms existing State-of-the-Art techniques. The code for this method is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current State-of-the-Art methods.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Prompt4Trust, an innovative reinforcement learning framework designed to improve confidence calibration in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) used in healthcare applications. The framework addresses the limitations of MLLMs, such as sensitivity to prompt design and tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. Prompt4Trust leverages a lightweight LLM to generate context-aware auxiliary prompts that help the downstream task MLLM produce responses with more accurate confidence levels.

Through this approach, the framework not only enhances confidence calibration but also boosts task accuracy, achieving top-notch performance in medical visual question answering tasks. Additionally, the framework exhibits promising zero-shot generalization from small to larger MLLMs, indicating scalability without increased computational overhead. Overall, Prompt4Trust showcases the potential of automated prompt engineering in strengthening the reliability of MLLMs in critical healthcare settings. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel framework for blind motion deblurring (BMD) that utilizes a deep generative model to improve kernel estimation. By pre-training a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a kernel initializer, the framework provides a better initialization for the blur kernel, reducing sensitivity to initializations. This approach constrains the BMD solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, enhancing overall performance. The proposed method can be easily integrated into existing BMD algorithms, improving their effectiveness. Additionally, the framework is extended to handle blind non-uniform motion deblurring without requiring additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging datasets. The source code for this approach is available on GitHub for reproducibility. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel. Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance. Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmark datasets.

Summary:
- The article introduces a semantic-aware localization framework for floorplans that estimates depth and semantic rays to predict a structural-semantic probability volume.
- The framework constructs a probability volume in a coarse-to-fine manner, starting with a low-resolution volume and refining it in high-probability regions.
- Evaluation on two standard floorplan localization benchmarks shows that the approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in recall metrics.
- The framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as room labels, leading to gains in accuracy and efficiency. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure, revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover, we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

This paper introduces the use of depth information to enhance recognition in surgical scenes, presenting Geo-RepNet. This framework combines RGB and depth information, utilizing the Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation module to extract geometry priors and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention for spatial guidance.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes. Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention (GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and low-texture surgical environments.

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100, CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space. Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

<div> keyword: path imitation learning, deep angular A*, path smoothness, path optimality, neural A* <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a novel learning method called deep angular A* (DAA*) for path imitation learning, focusing on path smoothness. By incorporating path angular freedom (PAF) into A* algorithm, DAA* improves path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. It aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion and optimizes path optimality by aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening and smoothing. DAA* outperforms neural A* in path similarity and path length. In evaluations on various datasets, DAA* showed significant improvements over existing methods, such as TransPath, when considering path loss and path probability map loss. The study also discusses a minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency in certain scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom (PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively. Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets, 2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2 scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM, and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where applicable.

Summary:
ALPHA introduces a comprehensive RGBA benchmark called ALPHA, specifically designed for transparent or layered content generation. ALPHAVAE, a RGBA VAE model, is proposed to extend pretrained RGB VAE by incorporating an alpha channel, achieving superior results with fewer training images compared to prior methods. The model is trained with a composite objective that ensures latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha representations. Results show a significant improvement in PSNR and SSIM metrics over existing techniques, enabling better transparent image generation when integrated into a latent diffusion framework. The code, data, and models are available for reproducibility on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction, patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion framework. Our code, data, and models are released on https://github.com/o0o0o00o0/AlphaVAE for reproducibility.

Summary:
Proactive interaction in multimodal dialogue systems is gaining importance, with users expecting systems to autonomously determine multi-turn responses during video playback. To address this, the ProactiveBench benchmark evaluates systems' proactive interaction abilities, while the PAUC metric considers the temporal dynamics of model responses. Compared to traditional metrics, PAUC aligns better with human preferences as it evaluates user experience in proactive scenarios. Through benchmarking baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study, it is evident that PAUC provides a more accurate assessment of user experience. This research highlights the significance of proactive interaction and the need for accurate metrics like PAUC to evaluate system performance in such settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction scenarios. Project homepage: https://github.com/yellow-binary-tree/ProactiveBench

Summary:
The paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder (DICCAE) for aligning audio-video representations at a fine-grained, category-level. It addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. A novel training framework incorporating both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion, is introduced. To combat the scarcity of audio-video data in human activity recognition, a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training strategy for DICCAE is proposed.

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder (DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained, category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating the necessity of each module.

<div> Keywords: 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models, visual token pruning, Fast3D, Global Attention Prediction, Sample-Adaptive Pruning

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper introduces Fast3D, a visual token pruning framework for 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The framework addresses the computational inefficiency of processing object-centric visual tokens in 3D scene representation. The authors discover redundancy in object-level 3D token representations and leverage global attention patterns to identify non-essential tokens. Fast3D features Global Attention Prediction (GAP) to estimate token importance for pruning guidance and Sample-Adaptive visual token Pruning (SAP) for dynamic token budget adjustment. These techniques do not alter the target model parameters. Evaluation across five benchmarks demonstrates Fast3D's effectiveness, especially for high pruning ratios. The code for Fast3D is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2507.09334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper, we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in 2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D, particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at https://github.com/wencan25/Fast3D

Summary:
Strong pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to outperform specialized TAD methods, while being more efficient. Weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are less effective for TAD, with self-supervised Masked Video Modeling providing the strongest signal. Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further boosts performance without anomalous examples. The study showcases the significance of pre-training and the feasibility of constructing effective, efficient TAD models with minimal architectural complexity. The research findings emphasize the potential of foundation models in achieving robust performance across tasks like Traffic Anomaly Detection.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code, domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work: https://github.com/tue-mps/simple-tad.

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline: image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing, normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions. Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a global scale.

Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging. These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for accurate labeling and annotation, variability in environmental conditions affecting data quality, and the integration of ML/AI tools into existing workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work, we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual branches that learn local and global representations for individual and multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while significantly reducing the computational cost.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1) Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training. (2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner. For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study, MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy. However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the \textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification and retrieval.

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over 4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy, but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model, GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Advancing Reliable Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models under Visual Variations</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

<title>QuarterMap: Efficient Post-Training Token Pruning for Visual State Space Models</title>

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11% speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure, where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe, QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without compromising transferability.

<title>When Schr\"odinger Bridge Meets Real-World Image Dehazing with Unpaired Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09524</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization, which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code: https://github.com/ywxjm/DehazeSB.

<title>VDInstruct: Zero-Shot Key Information Extraction via Content-Aware Vision Tokenization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09531</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model weights will be made publicly available.

<title>DRPCA-Net: Make Robust PCA Great Again for Infrared Small Target Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09541</link>

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing, industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network (DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets. Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST) groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper, we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group. However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge. In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available from https://github.com/GrokCV/SeqCSIST.

<title>EHPE: A Segmented Architecture for Enhanced Hand Pose Estimation</title>

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation (EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available at https://github.com/SereinNout/EHPE.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods, have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation. We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality, stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative possibilities for artists and designers.

arXiv:2507.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability. Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark, outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery, essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical surgical applications.

arXiv:2507.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding (DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on CPU devices.

<title>Towards Fine-Grained Adaptation of CLIP via a Self-Trained Alignment Score</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining. Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies, enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks, while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and classification.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework, particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing (up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77% AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10% AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2 and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with: motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations, existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior. Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing previous approaches. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JethroPeng/EyeSeg.

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints. To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric, outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset. Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a reliable and privacy-aware solution for continuous human motion analysis in indoor environments. Our codes are available in https://github.com/CarmenQing/VST-Pose.

Various deep learning approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with < 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S. and Israel.

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures, delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment instruction.

<title>Token Compression Meets Compact Vision Transformers: A Survey and Comparative Evaluation for Edge AI</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09702</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.09702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length, these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain. First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g., pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs. plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g., ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks for edge AI and AI agent applications.

<title>Advancing Text-to-3D Generation with Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09748</link>

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation (VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD). $L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases, compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial) approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance improvements.

<title>NegRefine: Refining Negative Label-Based Zero-Shot OOD Detection</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information. Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is available at https://github.com/ah-ansari/NegRefine.

<title>VRU-Accident: A Vision-Language Benchmark for Video Question Answering and Dense Captioning for Accident Scene Understanding</title>

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories (with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

<title>Hierarchical Abstraction Enables Human-Like 3D Object Recognition in Deep Learning Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09830</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition. We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2). Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

Abstract: Visually-Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) has emerged as a critical field, driven by the need to automatically process documents containing complex visual, textual, and layout information. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in this domain, leveraging both Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-dependent and OCR-free frameworks to extract and interpret information in document images. This survey reviews recent advancements in MLLM-based VRDU, highlighting three core components: (1) methods for encoding and fusing textual, visual, and layout features; (2) training paradigms, including pretraining strategies, instruction-response tuning, and the trainability of different model modules; and (3) datasets utilized for pretraining, instruction-tuning, and supervised fine-tuning. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in this evolving field and propose future directions to advance the efficiency, generalizability, and robustness of VRDU systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of large-scale models has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in the digital human domain. These advanced methodologies offer high-fidelity solutions for avatar driving and rendering, leading academia to focus on the next major challenge: audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual human. To facilitate research in this emerging area, we present SpeakerVid-5M dataset, the first large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual human generation. Totaling over 8,743 hours, SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking, listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of 2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based video chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of metrics and test data to serve as a benchmark VidChatBench for future work. Both the dataset and the corresponding data processing code will be publicly released. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/SpeakerVid-5M/

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3% acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was limited to parsing fixed classes.

arXiv:2507.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

<title>MCGA: Mixture of Codebooks Hyperspectral Reconstruction via Grayscale-Aware Attention</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA, which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention, which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/Fibonaccirabbit/MCGA

<title>Measuring the Impact of Rotation Equivariance on Aerial Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However, recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce. Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors. Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an exceptionally low parameter count.

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering, which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a new solution for graphic design.

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset, Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic, multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous, semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens.

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views. However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders (LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

<title>3DGAA: Realistic and Robust 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia) and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of 95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited biomedical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and logistics, achieving efficient and accurate Anti-UAV tracking has become essential. The importance of Anti-UAV tracking is increasingly prominent, especially in scenarios such as public safety, border patrol, search and rescue, and agricultural monitoring, where operations in complex environments can provide enhanced security. Current mainstream Anti-UAV tracking technologies are primarily centered around computer vision techniques, particularly those that integrate multi-sensor data fusion with advanced detection and tracking algorithms. This paper first reviews the characteristics and current challenges of Anti-UAV detection and tracking technologies. Next, it investigates and compiles several publicly available datasets, providing accessible links to support researchers in efficiently addressing related challenges. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the major vision-based and vision-fusion-based Anti-UAV detection and tracking algorithms proposed in recent years. Finally, based on the above research, this paper outlines future research directions, aiming to provide valuable insights for advancing the field.

<title>Binomial Self-Compensation: Mechanism and Suppression of Motion Error in Phase-Shifting Profilometry</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10009</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling. However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion. To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations. Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation (I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster motion error convergence.

<title>Cross-modal Associations in Vision and Language Models: Revisiting the bouba-kiki effect</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba" with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human intuitions.

<title>(Almost) Free Modality Stitching of Foundation Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by $10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

<title>Memory-Efficient Personalization of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Selective Optimization Strategies</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10029</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable, high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

<title>LifelongPR: Lifelong knowledge fusion for point cloud place recognition based on replay and prompt learning</title>

arXiv:2507.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

Abstract: This paper introduces CoSMo, a novel multimodal Transformer for Page Stream Segmentation (PSS) in comic books, a critical task for automated content understanding, as it is a necessary first stage for many downstream tasks like character analysis, story indexing, or metadata enrichment. We formalize PSS for this unique medium and curate a new 20,800-page annotated dataset. CoSMo, developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS macro-structure, yet demonstrate multimodal benefits in resolving challenging ambiguities. CoSMo establishes a new state-of-the-art, paving the way for scalable comic book analysis.

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis, salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab. Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource agricultural settings.

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis, reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework. By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

<title>Frequency Regulation for Exposure Bias Mitigation in Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias across different model architectures.

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

arXiv:2507.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder, CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1) A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction. (3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with long-text input.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking framework that ensures consistent global identity assignment across views using trajectory and appearance cues. The pipeline starts with BoT-SORT-based single-camera tracking, followed by an initial glance phase to initialize global IDs via trajectory-feature matching. In later frames, new tracklets are matched to existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or feature match is found. 3D positions are estimated using depth maps and calibration for spatial validation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The source code is available at https://github.com/helen1c/DEARLi.

<title>Taming Modern Point Tracking for Speckle Tracking Echocardiography via Impartial Motion</title>

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA) point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography. Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated, semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in real-world applications.

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures.

Abstract: Concrete workability is essential for construction quality, with the slump test being the most common on-site method for its assessment. However, traditional slump testing is manual, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency, limiting its applicability for real-time monitoring. To address these challenges, we propose SlumpGuard, an AI-powered, video-based system that automatically analyzes concrete flow from the truck chute to assess workability in real time. Our system enables full-batch inspection without manual intervention, improving both the accuracy and efficiency of quality control. We present the system design, a the construction of a dedicated dataset, and empirical results from real-world deployment, demonstrating the effectiveness of SlumpGuard as a practical solution for modern concrete quality assurance.

<title>Minimizing the Pretraining Gap: Domain-aligned Text-Based Person Retrieval</title>

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements. However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color, and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components, i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain, e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity. Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets, outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are available at https://github.com/Shuyu-XJTU/MRA.

<title>A Training-Free, Task-Agnostic Framework for Enhancing MLLM Performance on High-Resolution Images</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation. However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images, their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<title>Improving Multimodal Learning via Imbalanced Learning</title>

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error, ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARL.

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario. We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary investigation into this new realm of research.

<title>Boosting Multimodal Learning via Disentangled Gradient Learning</title>

arXiv:2507.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL) framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed DGL.

<title>From Wardrobe to Canvas: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA for Part-level Controllable Human Image Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images. However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity, clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

arXiv:2507.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization (VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both one-step and few-step generation tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively, this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time. We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient, accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis, due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait, to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset. We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models, demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for prosthesis-specific tasks.

<title>Synthesizing Near-Boundary OOD Samples for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

arXiv:2507.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space, can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced, boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score, effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by 11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM, a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of 26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

<title>Transferring Styles for Reduced Texture Bias and Improved Robustness in Semantic Segmentation Networks</title>

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints. In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments. Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation models.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions, regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets, 1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55% on four remote sensing datasets.

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained, identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process. This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips. Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation, showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video restoration.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy, human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM models are publicly available in the project page.

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo, a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness.

<title>Contrastive Pretraining with Dual Visual Encoders for Gloss-Free Sign Language Translation</title>

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

<title>Mind the Gap: Aligning Vision Foundation Models to Image Feature Matching</title>

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment, we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the quality of the generated images across various datasets.

arXiv:2507.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so, we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

<title>Beyond Graph Model: Reliable VLM Fine-Tuning via Random Graph Adapter</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10355</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also, it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<title>Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds, which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method outperforms existing ZSD models.

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations, yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical" views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes. Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts (contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

<title>Improving Remote Sensing Classification using Topological Data Analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving 99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45 dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search engines, social media, recommender systems, etc. The Devanagari script is one of the oldest language scripts in India that does not have proper digitization tools. With the advancement of computing and technology, the task of this research is to extract handwritten Hindi characters from an image of Devanagari script with an automated approach to save time and obsolete data. In this paper, we present a technique to recognize handwritten Devanagari characters using two deep convolutional neural network layers. This work employs a methodology that is useful to enhance the recognition rate and configures a convolutional neural network for effective Devanagari handwritten text recognition (DHTR). This approach uses the Devanagari handwritten character dataset (DHCD), an open dataset with 36 classes of Devanagari characters. Each of these classes has 1700 images for training and testing purposes. This approach obtains promising results in terms of accuracy by achieving 96.36% accuracy in testing and 99.55% in training time.

<title>Text-to-Remote-Sensing-Image Retrieval beyond RGB Sources</title>

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However, most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining), a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models. Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

The motivating problem is that of solving multiples instances of a parametric family of systems of algebraic (polynomial or rational function) equations. No doubt already of interest to ISSAC attendees, this problem arises in the context of robust model-fitting paradigms currently utilized by the computer vision community (namely "Random Sampling and Consensus", aka "RanSaC".) This talk will give an overview of work in the last 5+ years that aspires to measure the intrinsic difficulty of solving such parametric systems, and makes strides towards practical solutions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI) technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/mozhu1/SC-AGIQA.

arXiv:2507.10437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However, obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose 4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters, enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential for large-scale applications. The code is released at https://github.com/zhongshsh/4D-Animal.

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3 oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality. CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development, with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

arXiv:2507.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems, mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated. Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance, showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/yinzhicun/RefSTAR.

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction, retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month) and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time, instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives, we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system (SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to 99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3% accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults, but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting, particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the paper is accepted.

Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups. Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples), overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD.

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks, where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks, stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger model sizes.

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering ~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union (IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16 ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations. Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their trade-offs.

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present \textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches: ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours, whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However, their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework. The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation, object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below 20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Camera traps are revolutionising wildlife monitoring by capturing vast amounts of visual data; however, the manual identification of individual animals remains a significant bottleneck. This study introduces a fully self-supervised approach to learning robust chimpanzee face embeddings from unlabeled camera-trap footage. Leveraging the DINOv2 framework, we train Vision Transformers on automatically mined face crops, eliminating the need for identity labels. Our method demonstrates strong open-set re-identification performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor). WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at https://github.com/kunjing96/ZSNAS-WRCor.git.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline as its main symptom. In the research field of deep learning-assisted diagnosis of AD, traditional convolutional neural networks and simple feature concatenation methods fail to effectively utilize the complementary information between multimodal data, and the simple feature concatenation approach is prone to cause the loss of key information during the process of modal fusion. In recent years, the development of deep learning technology has brought new possibilities for solving the problem of how to effectively fuse multimodal features. This paper proposes a novel deep learning algorithm framework to assist medical professionals in AD diagnosis. By fusing medical multi-view information such as brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), genetic data, and clinical data, it can accurately detect the presence of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN). The innovation of the algorithm lies in the use of an asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism, which can effectively capture the key information features of the interactions between different data modal features. This paper compares the asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism with the traditional algorithm frameworks of unimodal and multimodal deep learning models for AD diagnosis, and evaluates the importance of the asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism. The algorithm model achieves an accuracy of 94.88% on the test set.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs). Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings, and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving systems.

<title>Interpretable Artificial Intelligence for Detecting Acute Heart Failure on Acute Chest CT Scans</title>

Abstract: Introduction: Chest CT scans are increasingly used in dyspneic patients where acute heart failure (AHF) is a key differential diagnosis. Interpretation remains challenging and radiology reports are frequently delayed due to a radiologist shortage, although flagging such information for emergency physicians would have therapeutic implication. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be a complementary tool to enhance the diagnostic precision. We aim to develop an explainable AI model to detect radiological signs of AHF in chest CT with an accuracy comparable to thoracic radiologists.
  Methods: A single-center, retrospective study during 2016-2021 at Copenhagen University Hospital - Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Denmark. A Boosted Trees model was trained to predict AHF based on measurements of segmented cardiac and pulmonary structures from acute thoracic CT scans. Diagnostic labels for training and testing were extracted from radiology reports. Structures were segmented with TotalSegmentator. Shapley Additive explanations values were used to explain the impact of each measurement on the final prediction.
  Results: Of the 4,672 subjects, 49% were female. The final model incorporated twelve key features of AHF and achieved an area under the ROC of 0.87 on the independent test set. Expert radiologist review of model misclassifications found that 24 out of 64 (38%) false positives and 24 out of 61 (39%) false negatives were actually correct model predictions, with the errors originating from inaccuracies in the initial radiology reports.
  Conclusion: We developed an explainable AI model with strong discriminatory performance, comparable to thoracic radiologists. The AI model's stepwise, transparent predictions may support decision-making.

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA. The code is available at https://github.com/ChenyuWang-Monica/REED.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in developing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) capable of processing both textual and visual inputs. These models have demonstrated impressive performance, leading to their widespread adoption in various applications. However, this widespread raises serious concerns regarding user privacy, particularly when models inadvertently process or expose private visual information. In this work, we frame the preservation of privacy in VLMs as an adversarial attack problem. We propose a novel attack strategy that selectively conceals information within designated Region Of Interests (ROIs) in an image, effectively preventing VLMs from accessing sensitive content while preserving the semantic integrity of the remaining image. Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that often disrupt the entire image, our method maintains high coherence in unmasked areas. Experimental results across three state-of-the-art VLMs namely LLaVA, Instruct-BLIP, and BLIP2-T5 demonstrate up to 98% reduction in detecting targeted ROIs, while maintaining global image semantics intact, as confirmed by high similarity scores between clean and adversarial outputs. We believe that this work contributes to a more privacy conscious use of multimodal models and offers a practical tool for further research, with the source code publicly available at: https://github.com/hbrachemi/Vlm_defense-attack.

Abstract: Data-hungry neuro-AI modelling requires ever larger neuroimaging datasets. CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide set of semantic concepts using well-characterized stimuli in a new densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative (THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories. We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.

Abstract: Confounders are extraneous variables that affect both the input and the target, resulting in spurious correlations and biased predictions. There are recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models, such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN) layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and continually update an internal model state with respect to changing distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.

Abstract: In spinal vertebral mobility disease, accurately extracting and contouring vertebrae is essential for assessing mobility impairments and monitoring variations during flexion-extension movements. Precise vertebral contouring plays a crucial role in surgical planning; however, this process is traditionally performed manually by radiologists or surgeons, making it labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. In particular, mobility disease analysis requires the individual contouring of each vertebra, which is both tedious and susceptible to inconsistencies. Automated methods provide a more efficient alternative, enabling vertebra identification, segmentation, and contouring with greater accuracy and reduced time consumption. In this study, we propose a novel U-Net variation designed to accurately segment thoracic vertebrae from anteroposterior view on X-Ray images. Our proposed approach, incorporating a ``sandwich" U-Net structure with dual activation functions, achieves a 4.1\% improvement in Dice score compared to the baseline U-Net model, enhancing segmentation accuracy while ensuring reliable vertebral contour extraction.

Abstract: Iterative generative models, like diffusion and flow-matching, create high-fidelity samples by progressively refining a noise vector into data. However, this process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function evaluations. We introduce the warm-start model, a simple, deterministic model that dramatically accelerates conditional generation by providing a better starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed N(0, I) prior, our warm-start model predicts an informed prior N(mu, sigma), whose moments are conditioned on the input context. This "warm start" substantially reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, particularly when the conditioning information is strongly informative. On tasks like image inpainting, our method achieves results competitive with a 1000-step DDPM baseline using only 11 total function evaluations (1 for the warm start, 10 for generation). A simple conditional normalization trick makes our method compatible with any standard generative model and sampler without modification, allowing it to be combined with other efficient sampling techniques for further acceleration. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/warm-start-model.

Abstract: There has been increasing interest in the generation of high-quality, realistic synthetic medical images in recent years. Such synthetic datasets can mitigate the scarcity of public datasets for artificial intelligence research, and can also be used for educational purposes. In this paper, we propose a combination of diffusion-based generation (PanoDiff) and Super-Resolution (SR) for generating synthetic dental panoramic radiographs (PRs). The former generates a low-resolution (LR) seed of a PR (256 X 128) which is then processed by the SR model to yield a high-resolution (HR) PR of size 1024 X 512. For SR, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer that learns local-global relationships, resulting in sharper edges and textures. Experimental results demonstrate a Frechet inception distance score of 40.69 between 7243 real and synthetic images (in HR). Inception scores were 2.55, 2.30, 2.90 and 2.98 for real HR, synthetic HR, real LR and synthetic LR images, respectively. Among a diverse group of six clinical experts, all evaluating a mixture of 100 synthetic and 100 real PRs in a time-limited observation, the average accuracy in distinguishing real from synthetic images was 68.5% (with 50% corresponding to random guessing).

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models often suffers from energy instabilities and guidance artifacts that degrade visual quality. We analyze the latent energy landscape during sampling and propose adaptive classifier-free guidance (CFG) schedules that maintain stable energy trajectories. Our approach introduces energy-aware scheduling strategies that modulate guidance strength over time, achieving superior stability scores (0.9998) and consistency metrics (0.9873) compared to fixed-guidance approaches. We demonstrate that DPM++ 2M with linear-decreasing CFG scheduling yields optimal performance, providing sharper, more faithful images while reducing artifacts. Our energy profiling framework serves as a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding and improving diffusion model behavior.

Abstract: Efficiently re-identifying and tracking objects across a network of cameras is crucial for applications like traffic surveillance. Spatula is the state-of-the-art video database management system (VDBMS) for processing Re-ID queries. However, it suffers from two limitations. Its spatio-temporal filtering scheme has limited accuracy on large camera networks due to localized camera history. It is not suitable for critical video analytics applications that require high recall due to a lack of support for adaptive query processing.
  In this paper, we present Tracer, a novel VDBMS for efficiently processing Re-ID queries using an adaptive query processing framework. Tracer selects the optimal camera to process at each time step by training a recurrent network to model long-term historical correlations. To accelerate queries under a high recall constraint, Tracer incorporates a probabilistic adaptive search model that processes camera feeds in incremental search windows and dynamically updates the sampling probabilities using an exploration-exploitation strategy. To address the paucity of benchmarks for the Re-ID task due to privacy concerns, we present a novel synthetic benchmark for generating multi-camera Re-ID datasets based on real-world traffic distribution. Our evaluation shows that Tracer outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-camera analytics system by 3.9x on average across diverse datasets.

Abstract: The brain can only be fully understood through the lens of the behavior it generates -- a guiding principle in modern neuroscience research that nevertheless presents significant technical challenges. Many studies capture behavior with cameras, but video analysis approaches typically rely on specialized models requiring extensive labeled data. We address this limitation with BEAST (BEhavioral Analysis via Self-supervised pretraining of Transformers), a novel and scalable framework that pretrains experiment-specific vision transformers for diverse neuro-behavior analyses. BEAST combines masked autoencoding with temporal contrastive learning to effectively leverage unlabeled video data. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple species, we demonstrate improved performance in three critical neuro-behavioral tasks: extracting behavioral features that correlate with neural activity, and pose estimation and action segmentation in both the single- and multi-animal settings. Our method establishes a powerful and versatile backbone model that accelerates behavioral analysis in scenarios where labeled data remains scarce.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for phase retrieval that leverages Langevin dynamics to enable efficient posterior sampling, yielding reconstructions that explicitly balance distortion and perceptual quality. Unlike conventional approaches that prioritize pixel-wise accuracy, our method navigates the perception-distortion tradeoff through a principled combination of stochastic sampling, learned denoising, and model-based updates. The framework comprises three variants of increasing complexity, integrating theoretically grounded Langevin inference, adaptive noise schedule learning, parallel reconstruction sampling, and warm-start initialization from classical solvers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, both in terms of fidelity and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Phase retrieval involves recovering a signal from intensity-only measurements, crucial in many fields such as imaging, holography, optical computing, crystallography, and microscopy. Although there are several well-known phase retrieval algorithms, including classical iterative solvers, the reconstruction performance often remains sensitive to initialization and measurement noise. Recently, image-to-image diffusion models have gained traction in various image reconstruction tasks, yielding significant theoretical insights and practical breakthroughs. In this work, we introduce a novel phase retrieval approach based on an image-to-image diffusion framework called Inversion by Direct Iteration. Our method begins with an enhanced initialization stage that leverages a hybrid iterative technique, combining the Hybrid Input-Output and Error Reduction methods and incorporating a novel acceleration mechanism to obtain a robust crude estimate. Then, it iteratively refines this initial crude estimate using the learned image-to-image pipeline. Our method achieves substantial improvements in both training efficiency and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our approach utilizes aggregation techniques to refine quality metrics and demonstrates superior results compared to both classical and contemporary techniques. This highlights its potential for effective and efficient phase retrieval across various applications.

Abstract: Deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices presents a significant challenge. This challenge is often addressed through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization (MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless technologies such as 6G aim to meet demanding requirements such as ultra-high data rates, low latency, and enhanced connectivity. Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However, realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information (CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume, escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in XL-MIMO systems.

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual homing.

Abstract: Medical Imagings are considered one of the crucial diagnostic tools for different bones-related diseases, especially bones fractures. This paper investigates the robustness of pre-trained deep learning models for classifying bone fractures in X-ray images and seeks to address global healthcare disparity through the lens of technology. Three deep learning models have been tested under varying simulated equipment quality conditions. ResNet50, VGG16 and EfficientNetv2 are the three pre-trained architectures which are compared. These models were used to perform bone fracture classification as images were progressively degraded using noise. This paper specifically empirically studies how the noise can affect the bone fractures detection and how the pre-trained models performance can be changes due to the noise that affect the quality of the X-ray images. This paper aims to help replicate real world challenges experienced by medical imaging technicians across the world. Thus, this paper establishes a methodological framework for assessing AI model degradation using transfer learning and controlled noise augmentation. The findings provide practical insight into how robust and generalizable different pre-trained deep learning powered computer vision models can be when used in different contexts.

Abstract: We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.
  By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics simulation framework.

Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children under five, requiring accurate chest X-ray diagnosis. This study presents a machine learning-based Pediatric Chest Pneumonia Classification System to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The CNN-based model was trained on 5,863 labeled chest X-ray images from children aged 0-5 years from the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center. To address limited data, we applied augmentation techniques (rotation, zooming, shear, horizontal flipping) and employed GANs to generate synthetic images, addressing class imbalance. The system achieved optimal performance using combined original, augmented, and GAN-generated data, evaluated through accuracy and F1 score metrics. The final model was deployed via a Flask web application, enabling real-time classification with probability estimates. Results demonstrate the potential of deep learning and GANs in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency for pediatric pneumonia classification, particularly valuable in resource-limited clinical settings https://github.com/AbdulManaf12/Pediatric-Chest-Pneumonia-Classification

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects, and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.

Abstract: Autoregressive next-token prediction with the Transformer decoder has become a de facto standard in large language models (LLMs), achieving remarkable success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at scale. Extending this paradigm to audio poses unique challenges due to its inherently continuous nature. We research audio generation with a causal language model (LM) without discrete tokens. We leverage token-wise diffusion to model the continuous distribution of the next continuous-valued token. Our approach delivers significant improvements over previous discrete solution, AudioGen, achieving 20% and 40% relative gains on AudioCaps in Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, respectively. Additionally, we propose a novel masked next-token prediction task that incorporates masked prediction into the causal LM framework. On AudioCaps, the innovation yields 41% and 33% relative FAD improvements over AudioGen Base (285M) and AudioGen Large (1B) models, respectively, and is on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion models. Furthermore, we achieve these results with significantly fewer parameters -- 193M for our Base and 462M for our Large models.

Abstract: Central to Earth observation is the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. For temperature, this is especially critical because real-world applications require high spatiotemporal resolution data. Current technology allows for hourly temperature observations at 2 km, but only every 16 days at 100 m, a gap further exacerbated by cloud cover. Earth system models offer continuous hourly temperature data, but at a much coarser spatial resolution (9-31 km). Here, we present a physics-guided deep learning framework for temperature data reconstruction that integrates these two data sources. The proposed framework uses a convolutional neural network that incorporates the annual temperature cycle and includes a linear term to amplify the coarse Earth system model output into fine-scale temperature values observed from satellites. We evaluated this framework using data from two satellites, GOES-16 (2 km, hourly) and Landsat (100 m, every 16 days), and demonstrated effective temperature reconstruction with hold-out and in situ data across four datasets. This physics-guided deep learning framework opens new possibilities for generating high-resolution temperature data across spatial and temporal scales, under all weather conditions and globally.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of U-Net architectures integrated with various convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones for automated lung cancer detection and segmentation in chest CT images, addressing the critical need for accurate diagnostic tools in clinical settings. A balanced dataset of 832 chest CT images (416 cancerous and 416 non-cancerous) was preprocessed using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and resized to 128x128 pixels. U-Net models were developed with three CNN backbones: ResNet50, VGG16, and Xception, to segment lung regions. After segmentation, CNN-based classifiers and hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Dice coefficient, and ROC-AUC. U-Net with ResNet50 achieved the best performance for cancerous lungs (Dice: 0.9495, Accuracy: 0.9735), while U-Net with VGG16 performed best for non-cancerous segmentation (Dice: 0.9532, Accuracy: 0.9513). For classification, the CNN model using U-Net with Xception achieved 99.1 percent accuracy, 99.74 percent recall, and 99.42 percent F1-score. The hybrid CNN-SVM-Xception model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy and 97.88 percent F1-score. Compared to prior methods, our framework consistently outperformed existing models. In conclusion, combining U-Net with advanced CNN backbones provides a powerful method for both segmentation and classification of lung cancer in CT scans, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has been a pivotal task in image processing, aimed at enhancing image resolution across various applications. Recently, look-up table (LUT)-based approaches have attracted interest due to their efficiency and performance. However, these methods are typically designed for fixed scale factors, making them unsuitable for arbitrary-scale image SR (ASISR). Existing ASISR techniques often employ implicit neural representations, which come with considerable computational cost and memory demands. To address these limitations, we propose Interpolation Mixing LUT (IM-LUT), a novel framework that operates ASISR by learning to blend multiple interpolation functions to maximize their representational capacity. Specifically, we introduce IM-Net, a network trained to predict mixing weights for interpolation functions based on local image patterns and the target scale factor. To enhance efficiency of interpolation-based methods, IM-Net is transformed into IM-LUT, where LUTs are employed to replace computationally expensive operations, enabling lightweight and fast inference on CPUs while preserving reconstruction quality. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that IM-LUT consistently achieves a superior balance between image quality and efficiency compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential as a promising solution for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Dense audio-visual event localization (DAVE) aims to identify event categories and locate the temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos. Most studies only employ event-related semantic constraints on the final outputs, lacking cross-modal semantic bridging in intermediate layers. This causes modality semantic gap for further fusion, making it difficult to distinguish between event-related content and irrelevant background content. Moreover, they rarely consider the correlations between events, which limits the model to infer concurrent events among complex scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate multi-stage semantic guidance and multi-event relationship modeling, which respectively enable hierarchical semantic understanding of audio-visual events and adaptive extraction of event dependencies, thereby better focusing on event-related information. Specifically, our eventaware semantic guided network (ESG-Net) includes a early semantics interaction (ESI) module and a mixture of dependency experts (MoDE) module. ESI applys multi-stage semantic guidance to explicitly constrain the model in learning semantic information through multi-modal early fusion and several classification loss functions, ensuring hierarchical understanding of event-related content. MoDE promotes the extraction of multi-event dependencies through multiple serial mixture of experts with adaptive weight allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, while greatly reducing parameters and computational load. Our code will be released on https://github.com/uchiha99999/ESG-Net.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information, facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms: 3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of 0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor (ET) region.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, yet the variability in imaging quality across different MRI scanners presents significant challenges to model generalization. To address this, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System (EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to adaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby enhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to this system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive Encoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a Graph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model complementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we introduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that synergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed convolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, improving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves a Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million parameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer models, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches. This work demonstrates a synergistic breakthrough in achieving high-accuracy, resource-efficient brain tumor segmentation suitable for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.

Abstract: This demonstration paper presents $\mathbf{LayLens}$, a tool aimed to make deepfake understanding easier for users of all educational backgrounds. While prior works often rely on outputs containing technical jargon, LayLens bridges the gap between model reasoning and human understanding through a three-stage pipeline: (1) explainable deepfake detection using a state-of-the-art forgery localization model, (2) natural language simplification of technical explanations using a vision-language model, and (3) visual reconstruction of a plausible original image via guided image editing. The interface presents both technical and layperson-friendly explanations in addition to a side-by-side comparison of the uploaded and reconstructed images. A user study with 15 participants shows that simplified explanations significantly improve clarity and reduce cognitive load, with most users expressing increased confidence in identifying deepfakes. LayLens offers a step toward transparent, trustworthy, and user-centric deepfake forensics.

Abstract: Accurate inference of human intent enables human-robot collaboration without constraining human control or causing conflicts between humans and robots. We present GUIDER (Global User Intent Dual-phase Estimation for Robots), a probabilistic framework that enables a robot to estimate the intent of human operators. GUIDER maintains two coupled belief layers, one tracking navigation goals and the other manipulation goals. In the Navigation phase, a Synergy Map blends controller velocity with an occupancy grid to rank interaction areas. Upon arrival at a goal, an autonomous multi-view scan builds a local 3D cloud. The Manipulation phase combines U2Net saliency, FastSAM instance saliency, and three geometric grasp-feasibility tests, with an end-effector kinematics-aware update rule that evolves object probabilities in real-time. GUIDER can recognize areas and objects of intent without predefined goals. We evaluated GUIDER on 25 trials (five participants x five task variants) in Isaac Sim, and compared it with two baselines, one for navigation and one for manipulation. Across the 25 trials, GUIDER achieved a median stability of 93-100% during navigation, compared with 60-100% for the BOIR baseline, with an improvement of 39.5% in a redirection scenario (T5). During manipulation, stability reached 94-100% (versus 69-100% for Trajectron), with a 31.4% difference in a redirection task (T3). In geometry-constrained trials (manipulation), GUIDER recognized the object intent three times earlier than Trajectron (median remaining time to confident prediction 23.6 s vs 7.8 s). These results validate our dual-phase framework and show improvements in intent inference in both phases of mobile manipulation tasks.

Abstract: How can we learn a representation with high predictive power while preserving user privacy? We present an adversarial representation learning method for sanitizing sensitive content from the learned representation. Specifically, we introduce a variant of entropy - focal entropy, which mitigates the potential information leakage of the existing entropy-based approaches. We showcase feasibility on multiple benchmarks. The results suggest high target utility at moderate privacy leakage.

Abstract: Accurate and timely cancer diagnosis from histopathological slides is vital for effective clinical decision-making. This paper introduces DepViT-CAD, a deployable AI system for multi-class cancer diagnosis in histopathology. At its core is MAViT, a novel Multi-Attention Vision Transformer designed to capture fine-grained morphological patterns across diverse tumor types. MAViT was trained on expert-annotated patches from 1008 whole-slide images, covering 11 diagnostic categories, including 10 major cancers and non-tumor tissue. DepViT-CAD was validated on two independent cohorts: 275 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 50 routine clinical cases from pathology labs, achieving diagnostic sensitivities of 94.11% and 92%, respectively. By combining state-of-the-art transformer architecture with large-scale real-world validation, DepViT-CAD offers a robust and scalable approach for AI-assisted cancer diagnostics. To support transparency and reproducibility, software and code will be made publicly available at GitHub.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is able to build latent representations that generalize well to unseen data. However, only a few SSL techniques exist for the online CL setting, where data arrives in small minibatches, the model must comply with a fixed computational budget, and task boundaries are absent. We introduce Continual Latent Alignment (CLA), a novel SSL strategy for Online CL that aligns the representations learned by the current model with past representations to mitigate forgetting. We found that our CLA is able to speed up the convergence of the training process in the online scenario, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under the same computational budget. Surprisingly, we also discovered that using CLA as a pretraining protocol in the early stages of pretraining leads to a better final performance when compared to a full i.i.d. pretraining.

<title>Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS with Generative AI for Real-Time Driver Assistance</title>

Abstract: While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity real-time animated sequences of photorealistic 3D head avatars is important for many graphics applications, including immersive telepresence and movies. This is a challenging problem particularly when rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads, including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing diverse facial expressions and styles in real time.

Abstract: Capsule networks are biologically inspired neural networks that group neurons into vectors called capsules, each explicitly representing an object or one of its parts. The routing mechanism connects capsules in consecutive layers, forming a hierarchical structure between parts and objects, also known as a parse tree. Capsule networks often attempt to model all elements in an image, requiring large network sizes to handle complexities such as intricate backgrounds or irrelevant objects. However, this comprehensive modeling leads to increased parameter counts and computational inefficiencies. Our goal is to enable capsule networks to focus only on the object of interest, reducing the number of parse trees. We accomplish this with REM (Routing Entropy Minimization), a technique that minimizes the entropy of the parse tree-like structure. REM drives the model parameters distribution towards low entropy configurations through a pruning mechanism, significantly reducing the generation of intra-class parse trees. This empowers capsules to learn more stable and succinct representations with fewer parameters and negligible performance loss.

<title>Adaptive deep learning framework for robust unsupervised underwater image enhancement</title>

Abstract: One of the main challenges in deep learning-based underwater image enhancement is the limited availability of high-quality training data. Underwater images are difficult to capture and are often of poor quality due to the distortion and loss of colour and contrast in water. This makes it difficult to train supervised deep learning models on large and diverse datasets, which can limit the model's performance. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to supervised underwater image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised underwater image enhancement framework that employs a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to train a deep learning model with probabilistic adaptive instance normalization (PAdaIN) and statistically guided multi-colour space stretch that produces realistic underwater images. The resulting framework is composed of a U-Net as a feature extractor and a PAdaIN to encode the uncertainty, which we call UDnet. To improve the visual quality of the images generated by UDnet, we use a statistically guided multi-colour space stretch module that ensures visual consistency with the input image and provides an alternative to training using a ground truth image. The proposed model does not need manual human annotation and can learn with a limited amount of data and achieves state-of-the-art results on underwater images. We evaluated our proposed framework on eight publicly-available datasets. The results show that our proposed framework yields competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches in quantitative as well as qualitative metrics.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained Transformer models can focus on either introducing a small number of new learnable parameters (parameter efficiency) or editing representations of a small number of tokens using lightweight modules (representation efficiency). While the pioneering method LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) inherently balances parameter, compute, and memory efficiency, many subsequent variants trade off compute and memory efficiency and/or performance to further reduce fine-tuning parameters. To address this limitation and unify parameter-efficient and representation-efficient fine-tuning, we propose Weight-Generative Fine-Tuning (WeGeFT, pronounced wee-gift), a novel approach that learns to generate fine-tuning weights directly from the pretrained weights. WeGeFT employs a simple low-rank formulation consisting of two linear layers, either shared across multiple layers of the pretrained model or individually learned for different layers. This design achieves multi-faceted efficiency in parameters, representations, compute, and memory, while maintaining or exceeding the performance of LoRA and its variants. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction following, code generation, and visual recognition verify the effectiveness of our proposed WeGeFT.

Abstract: Cropland maps are essential for remote sensing-based agricultural monitoring, providing timely insights without extensive field surveys. Machine learning enables large-scale mapping but depends on geo-referenced ground-truth data, which is costly to collect, motivating the use of global datasets in data-scarce regions. A key challenge is understanding how the quantity, quality, and proximity of the training data to the target region influences model performance. We evaluate this in Nigeria, using 1,827 manually labelled samples covering the whole country, and subsets of the Geowiki dataset: Nigeria-only, regional (Nigeria and neighbouring countries), and global. We extract pixel-wise multi-source time series arrays from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ERA5 climate, and a digital elevation model using Google Earth Engine, comparing Random Forests with LSTMs, including a lightweight multi-headed LSTM variant. Results show local data significantly boosts performance, with accuracy gains up to 0.246 (RF) and 0.178 (LSTM). Nigeria-only or regional data outperformed global data despite the lower amount of labels, with the exception of the multi-headed LSTM, which benefited from global data when local samples were absent. Sentinel-1, climate, and topographic data are critical data sources, with their removal reducing F1-score by up to 0.593. Addressing class imbalance also improved LSTM accuracy by up to 0.071. Our top-performing model (Nigeria-only LSTM) achieved an F1-score of 0.814 and accuracy of 0.842, matching the best global land cover product while offering stronger recall, critical for food security. We release code, data, maps, and an interactive web app to support future work.

<title>Adversarial Augmentation Training Makes Action Recognition Models More Robust to Realistic Video Distribution Shifts</title>

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video action recognition achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, these models often lack robustness when faced with natural distribution shifts between training and test data. We propose two novel evaluation methods to assess model resilience to such distribution disparity. One method uses two different datasets collected from different sources and uses one for training and validation, and the other for testing. More precisely, we created dataset splits of HMDB-51 or UCF-101 for training, and Kinetics-400 for testing, using the subset of the classes that are overlapping in both train and test datasets. The other proposed method extracts the feature mean of each class from the target evaluation dataset's training data (i.e. class prototype) and estimates test video prediction as a cosine similarity score between each sample to the class prototypes of each target class. This procedure does not alter model weights using the target dataset and it does not require aligning overlapping classes of two different datasets, thus is a very efficient method to test the model robustness to distribution shifts without prior knowledge of the target distribution. We address the robustness problem by adversarial augmentation training - generating augmented views of videos that are "hard" for the classification model by applying gradient ascent on the augmentation parameters - as well as "curriculum" scheduling the strength of the video augmentations. We experimentally demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed adversarial augmentation approach over baselines across three state-of-the-art action recognition models - TSM, Video Swin Transformer, and Uniformer. The presented work provides critical insight into model robustness to distribution shifts and presents effective techniques to enhance video action recognition performance in a real-world deployment.

Abstract: Shadows significantly hinder computer vision tasks in outdoor environments, particularly in field robotics, where varying lighting conditions complicate object detection and localisation. We present FieldNet, a novel deep learning framework for real-time shadow removal, optimised for resource-constrained hardware. FieldNet introduces a probabilistic enhancement module and a novel loss function to address challenges of inconsistent shadow boundary supervision and artefact generation, achieving enhanced accuracy and simplicity without requiring shadow masks during inference. Trained on a dataset of 10,000 natural images augmented with synthetic shadows, FieldNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets (ISTD, ISTD+, SRD), with up to $9$x speed improvements (66 FPS on Nvidia 2080Ti) and superior shadow removal quality (PSNR: 38.67, SSIM: 0.991). Real-world case studies in precision agriculture robotics demonstrate the practical impact of FieldNet in enhancing weed detection accuracy. These advancements establish FieldNet as a robust, efficient solution for real-time vision tasks in field robotics and beyond.

Abstract: Accurately segmenting 3D curvilinear structures in medical imaging remains challenging due to their complex geometry and the scarcity of diverse, large-scale datasets for algorithm development and evaluation. In this paper, we use dendritic spine segmentation as a case study and address these challenges by introducing a novel Frenet--Serret Frame-based Decomposition, which decomposes 3D curvilinear structures into a globally \( C^2 \) continuous curve that captures the overall shape, and a cylindrical primitive that encodes local geometric properties. This approach leverages Frenet--Serret Frames and arc length parameterization to preserve essential geometric features while reducing representational complexity, facilitating data-efficient learning, improved segmentation accuracy, and generalization on 3D curvilinear structures. To rigorously evaluate our method, we introduce two datasets: CurviSeg, a synthetic dataset for 3D curvilinear structure segmentation that validates our method's key properties, and DenSpineEM, a benchmark for dendritic spine segmentation, which comprises 4,476 manually annotated spines from 70 dendrites across three public electron microscopy datasets, covering multiple brain regions and species. Our experiments on DenSpineEM demonstrate exceptional cross-region and cross-species generalization: models trained on the mouse somatosensory cortex subset achieve 91.9\% Dice, maintaining strong performance in zero-shot segmentation on both mouse visual cortex (94.1\% Dice) and human frontal lobe (81.8\% Dice) subsets. Moreover, we test the generalizability of our method on the IntrA dataset, where it achieves 77.08\% Dice (5.29\% higher than prior arts) on intracranial aneurysm segmentation. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach for accurately analyzing complex curvilinear structures across diverse medical imaging fields.

Abstract: Continuous Conditional Generative Modeling (CCGM) estimates high-dimensional data distributions, such as images, conditioned on scalar continuous variables (aka regression labels). While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UBCDingXin/CCDM.

Abstract: Data augmentation (DA) is widely employed to improve the generalization performance of deep models. However, most existing DA methods employ augmentation operations with fixed or random magnitudes throughout the training process. While this fosters data diversity, it can also inevitably introduce uncontrolled variability in augmented data, which could potentially cause misalignment with the evolving training status of the target models. Both theoretical and empirical findings suggest that this misalignment increases the risks of both underfitting and overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose AdaAugment, an innovative and tuning-free adaptive augmentation method that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically and adaptively adjust augmentation magnitudes for individual training samples based on real-time feedback from the target network. Specifically, AdaAugment features a dual-model architecture consisting of a policy network and a target network, which are jointly optimized to adapt augmentation magnitudes in accordance with the model's training progress effectively. The policy network optimizes the variability within the augmented data, while the target network utilizes the adaptively augmented samples for training. These two networks are jointly optimized and mutually reinforce each other. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and deep architectures demonstrate that AdaAugment consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art DA methods in effectiveness while maintaining remarkable efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/Jackbrocp/AdaAugment.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) aim to simulate human subjective perception of image visual quality and aesthetic appeal. Despite distinct learning objectives, they have underlying interconnectedness due to consistent human assessment perception. In this paper, we propose Unified vision-language pre-training of Quality and Aesthetics (UniQA}), to extract useful and common representations from two tasks, thereby benefiting them simultaneously. However, the lack of text in the IQA datasets and the textual noise in the IAA datasets pose severe challenges for multimodal pre-training. To address this, we (1) utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate high-quality text descriptions; (2) use the generated text for IAA as metadata to purify noisy IAA data. To effectively adapt the pre-trained UniQA to downstream tasks, we further propose a lightweight adapter that utilizes versatile cues to fully exploit the extensive knowledge of the pre-trained model. UniQA demonstrates high competitiveness in various image assessment tasks, including classical IQA and IAA tasks, few-label IQA, and other downstream tasks, showing promise as a foundational assessment model. Codes are available at https://github.com/zht8506/UniQA.

Abstract: As the number of people affected by diseases in the gastrointestinal system is ever-increasing, a higher demand on preventive screening is inevitable. This will significantly increase the workload on gastroenterologists. To help reduce the workload, tools from computer vision may be helpful. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of constructing 3D models of whole sections of the human colon using image sequences from wireless capsule endoscope video, providing enhanced viewing for gastroenterologists. As capsule endoscope images contain distortion and artifacts non-ideal for many 3D reconstruction algorithms, the problem is challenging. However, recent developments of virtual graphics-based models of the human gastrointestinal system, where distortion and artifacts can be enabled or disabled, makes it possible to ``dissect'' the problem. The graphical model also provides a ground truth, enabling computation of geometric distortion introduced by the 3D reconstruction method. In this paper, most distortions and artifacts are left out to determine if it is feasible to reconstruct whole sections of the human gastrointestinal system by existing methods. We demonstrate that 3D reconstruction is possible using simultaneous localization and mapping. Further, to reconstruct the gastrointestinal wall surface from resulting point clouds, varying greatly in density, Poisson surface reconstruction is a good option. The results are promising, encouraging further research on this problem.

Abstract: The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration.

Abstract: Unsupervised restoration approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a promising solution without requiring paired datasets. Yet, these GAN-based approaches struggle to surpass the performance of conventional unsupervised GAN-based frameworks without significantly modifying model structures or increasing the computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for existing restoration models. This strategy utilizes information from the previous stage as feedback to guide subsequent stages, achieving significant performance improvement without increasing the framework's inference complexity. The SC strategy comprises a prompt learning (PL) module and a restorer ($Res$). It iteratively replaces the previous less powerful fixed restorer $\overline{Res}$ in the PL module with a more powerful $Res$. The enhanced PL module generates better pseudo-degraded/clean image pairs, leading to a more powerful $Res$ for the next iteration. Our SC can significantly improve the $Res$'s performance by over 1.5 dB without adding extra parameters or computational complexity during inference. Meanwhile, existing self-ensemble (SE) and our SC strategies enhance the performance of pre-trained restorers from different perspectives. As SE increases computational complexity during inference, we propose a re-boosting module to the SC (Reb-SC) to improve the SC strategy further by incorporating SE into SC without increasing inference time. This approach further enhances the restorer's performance by approximately 0.3 dB. Extensive experimental results on restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art unsupervised restoration methods.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianOcc, a systematic method that investigates the two usages of Gaussian splatting for fully self-supervised and efficient 3D occupancy estimation in surround views. First, traditional methods for self-supervised 3D occupancy estimation still require ground truth 6D poses from sensors during training. To address this limitation, we propose Gaussian Splatting for Projection (GSP) module to provide accurate scale information for fully self-supervised training from adjacent view projection. Additionally, existing methods rely on volume rendering for final 3D voxel representation learning using 2D signals (depth maps, semantic maps), which is both time-consuming and less effective. We propose Gaussian Splatting from Voxel space (GSV) to leverage the fast rendering properties of Gaussian splatting. As a result, the proposed GaussianOcc method enables fully self-supervised (no ground truth pose) 3D occupancy estimation in competitive performance with low computational cost (2.7 times faster in training and 5 times faster in rendering). The relevant code is available in https://github.com/GANWANSHUI/GaussianOcc.git.

Abstract: Combining Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with diffusion models offers a powerful method for executing image editing tasks based on human language instructions. However, language instructions alone often fall short in accurately conveying user requirements, particularly when users want to add, replace elements in specific areas of an image. Luckily, masks can effectively indicate the exact locations or elements to be edited, while they require users to precisely draw the shapes at the desired locations, which is highly user-unfriendly. To address this, we propose FlexEdit, an end-to-end image editing method that leverages both free-shape masks and language instructions for Flexible Editing. Our approach employs a VLLM in comprehending the image content, mask, and user instructions. Additionally, we introduce the Mask Enhance Adapter (MEA) that fuses the embeddings of the VLLM with the image data, ensuring a seamless integration of mask information and model output embeddings. Furthermore, we construct FSMI-Edit, a benchmark specifically tailored for free-shape mask, including 8 types of free-shape mask. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in LLM-based image editing, and our simple prompting technique stands out in its effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the realm of 4-D light fields (LFs) to enhance underwater imaging plagued by light absorption, scattering, and other challenges. Contrasting with conventional 2-D RGB imaging, 4-D LF imaging excels in capturing scenes from multiple perspectives, thereby indirectly embedding geometric information. This intrinsic property is anticipated to effectively address the challenges associated with underwater imaging. By leveraging both explicit and implicit depth cues present in 4-D LF images, we propose a progressive, mutually reinforcing framework for underwater 4-D LF image enhancement and depth estimation. Specifically, our framework explicitly utilizes estimated depth information alongside implicit depth-related dynamic convolutional kernels to modulate output features. The entire framework decomposes this complex task, iteratively optimizing the enhanced image and depth information to progressively achieve optimal enhancement results. More importantly, we construct the first 4-D LF-based underwater image dataset for quantitative evaluation and supervised training of learning-based methods, comprising 75 underwater scenes and 3675 high-resolution 2K pairs. To craft vibrant and varied underwater scenes, we build underwater environments with various objects and adopt several types of degradation. Through extensive experimentation, we showcase the potential and superiority of 4-D LF-based underwater imaging vis-a-vis traditional 2-D RGB-based approaches. Moreover, our method effectively corrects color bias and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The dataset and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/linlos1234/LFUIE.

Abstract: A prior global topological map (e.g., the OpenStreetMap, OSM) can boost the performance of autonomous mapping by a ground mobile robot. However, the prior map is usually incomplete due to lacking labeling in partial paths. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an OSM maker using airborne sensors carried by low-altitude aircraft, where the core of the OSM maker is a novel efficient pathfinder approach based on LiDAR and camera data, i.e., a binary dual-stream road segmentation model. Specifically, a multi-scale feature extraction based on the UNet architecture is implemented for images and point clouds. To reduce the effect caused by the sparsity of point cloud, an attention-guided gated block is designed to integrate image and point-cloud features. To optimize the model for edge deployment that significantly reduces storage footprint and computational demands, we propose a binarization streamline to each model component, including a variant of vision transformer (ViT) architecture as the encoder of the image branch, and new focal and perception losses to optimize the model training. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our pathfinder method achieves SOTA accuracy with high efficiency in finding paths from the low-level airborne sensors, and we can create complete OSM prior maps based on the segmented road skeletons.

Abstract: Visual localization refers to the process of determining camera poses and orientation within a known scene representation. This task is often complicated by factors such as changes in illumination and variations in viewing angles. In this paper, we propose HGSLoc, a novel lightweight plug-and-play pose optimization framework, which integrates 3D reconstruction with a heuristic refinement strategy to achieve higher pose estimation accuracy. Specifically, we introduce an explicit geometric map for 3D representation and high-fidelity rendering, allowing the generation of high-quality synthesized views to support accurate visual localization. Our method demonstrates higher localization accuracy compared to NeRF-based neural rendering localization approaches. We introduce a heuristic refinement strategy, its efficient optimization capability can quickly locate the target node, while we set the step level optimization step to enhance the pose accuracy in the scenarios with small errors. With carefully designed heuristic functions, it offers efficient optimization capabilities, enabling rapid error reduction in rough localization estimations. Our method mitigates the dependence on complex neural network models while demonstrating improved robustness against noise and higher localization accuracy in challenging environments, as compared to neural network joint optimization strategies. The optimization framework proposed in this paper introduces novel approaches to visual localization by integrating the advantages of 3D reconstruction and the heuristic refinement strategy, which demonstrates strong performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including 7Scenes and Deep Blending dataset. The implementation of our method has been released at https://github.com/anchang699/HGSLoc.

Abstract: Monocular Depth and Surface Normals Estimation (MDSNE) is crucial for tasks such as 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and underwater exploration. Current methods rely either on discriminative models, which struggle with transparent or reflective surfaces, or generative models, which, while accurate, are computationally expensive. This paper presents a novel deep learning model for MDSNE, specifically tailored for underwater environments, using a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Transformers, leveraging the strengths of both approaches. Training effective MDSNE models is often hampered by noisy real-world datasets and the limited generalization of synthetic datasets. To address this, we generate pseudo-labeled real data using multiple pre-trained MDSNE models. To ensure the quality of this data, we propose the Depth Normal Evaluation and Selection Algorithm (DNESA), which evaluates and selects the most reliable pseudo-labeled samples using domain-specific metrics. A lightweight student model is then trained on this curated dataset. Our model reduces parameters by 90% and training costs by 80%, allowing real-time 3D perception on resource-constrained devices. Key contributions include: a novel and efficient MDSNE model, the DNESA algorithm, a domain-specific data pipeline, and a focus on real-time performance and scalability. Designed for real-world underwater applications, our model facilitates low-cost deployments in underwater robots and autonomous vehicles, bridging the gap between research and practical implementation.

Abstract: Human-centric generative models are becoming increasingly popular, giving rise to various innovative tools and applications, such as talking face videos conditioned on text or audio prompts. The core of these capabilities lies in powerful pre-trained foundation models, trained on large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, many advanced methods rely on in-house data subject to various constraints, and other current studies fail to generate high-resolution face videos, which is mainly attributed to the significant lack of large-scale, high-quality face video datasets. In this paper, we introduce a human face video dataset, \textbf{DH-FaceVid-1K}. Our collection spans 1,200 hours in total, encompassing 270,043 video clips from over 20,000 individuals. Each sample includes corresponding speech audio, facial keypoints, and text annotations. Compared to other publicly available datasets, ours distinguishes itself through its multi-ethnic coverage and high-quality, comprehensive individual attributes. We establish multiple face video generation models supporting tasks such as text-to-video and image-to-video generation. In addition, we develop comprehensive benchmarks to validate the scaling law when using different proportions of proposed dataset. Our primary aim is to contribute a face video dataset, particularly addressing the underrepresentation of Asian faces in existing curated datasets and thereby enriching the global spectrum of face-centric data and mitigating demographic biases. \textbf{Project Page:} https://luna-ai-lab.github.io/DH-FaceVid-1K/

Abstract: Understanding land cover holds considerable potential for a myriad of practical applications, particularly as data accessibility transitions from being exclusive to governmental and commercial entities to now including the broader research community. Nevertheless, although the data is accessible to any community member interested in exploration, there exists a formidable learning curve and no standardized process for accessing, pre-processing, and leveraging the data for subsequent tasks. In this study, we democratize this data by presenting a flexible and efficient end to end pipeline for working with the Dynamic World dataset, a cutting-edge near-real-time land use/land cover (LULC) dataset. This includes a pre-processing and representation framework which tackles noise removal, efficient extraction of large amounts of data, and re-representation of LULC data in a format well suited for several downstream tasks. To demonstrate the power of our pipeline, we use it to extract data for an urbanization prediction problem and build a suite of machine learning models with excellent performance. This task is easily generalizable to the prediction of any type of land cover and our pipeline is also compatible with a series of other downstream tasks.

Abstract: We present MEGA-Bench, an evaluation suite that scales multimodal evaluation to over 500 real-world tasks, to address the highly heterogeneous daily use cases of end users. Our objective is to optimize for a set of high-quality data samples that cover a highly diverse and rich set of multimodal tasks, while enabling cost-effective and accurate model evaluation. In particular, we collected 505 realistic tasks encompassing over 8,000 samples from 16 expert annotators to extensively cover the multimodal task space. Instead of unifying these problems into standard multi-choice questions (like MMMU, MMBench, and MMT-Bench), we embrace a wide range of output formats like numbers, phrases, code, \LaTeX, coordinates, JSON, free-form, etc. To accommodate these formats, we developed over 40 metrics to evaluate these tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks, MEGA-Bench offers a fine-grained capability report across multiple dimensions (e.g., application, input type, output format, skill), allowing users to interact with and visualize model capabilities in depth. We evaluate a wide variety of frontier vision-language models on MEGA-Bench to understand their capabilities across these dimensions.

Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for capturing complex dynamic 3D scenes with high fidelity. It utilizes a 4D Gaussian representation and a GPU-friendly rasterizer, enabling rapid rendering speeds. Despite its advantages, 4DGS faces significant challenges, notably the requirement of millions of 4D Gaussians, each with extensive associated attributes, leading to substantial memory and storage cost. This paper introduces a memory-efficient framework for 4DGS. We streamline the color attribute by decomposing it into a per-Gaussian direct color component with only 3 parameters and a shared lightweight alternating current color predictor. This approach eliminates the need for spherical harmonics coefficients, which typically involve up to 144 parameters in classic 4DGS, thereby creating a memory-efficient 4D Gaussian representation. Furthermore, we introduce an entropy-constrained Gaussian deformation technique that uses a deformation field to expand the action range of each Gaussian and integrates an opacity-based entropy loss to limit the number of Gaussians, thus forcing our model to use as few Gaussians as possible to fit a dynamic scene well. With simple half-precision storage and zip compression, our framework achieves a storage reduction by approximately 190$\times$ and 125$\times$ on the Technicolor and Neural 3D Video datasets, respectively, compared to the original 4DGS. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable rendering speeds and scene representation quality, setting a new standard in the field. Code is available at https://github.com/Xinjie-Q/MEGA.

<title>Unraveling the Connections between Flow Matching and Diffusion Probabilistic Models in Training-free Conditional Generation</title>

Abstract: Training-free conditional generation based on flow matching aims to leverage pre-trained unconditional flow matching models to perform conditional generation without retraining. Recently, a successful training-free conditional generation approach incorporates conditions via posterior sampling, which relies on the availability of a score function in the unconditional diffusion model. However, flow matching models do not possess an explicit score function, rendering such a strategy inapplicable. Approximate posterior sampling for flow matching has been explored, but it is limited to linear inverse problems. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching-based Posterior Sampling (FMPS) to expand its application scope. We introduce a correction term by steering the velocity field. This correction term can be reformulated to incorporate a surrogate score function, thereby bridging the gap between flow matching models and score-based posterior sampling. Hence, FMPS enables the posterior sampling to be adjusted within the flow matching framework. Further, we propose two practical implementations of the correction mechanism: one aimed at improving generation quality, and the other focused on computational efficiency. Experimental results on diverse conditional generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation quality compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness and generality of FMPS.

Abstract: Egocentric videos provide valuable insights into human interactions with the physical world, which has sparked growing interest in the computer vision and robotics communities. A critical challenge in fully understanding the geometry and dynamics of egocentric videos is dense scene reconstruction. However, the lack of high-quality labeled datasets in this field has hindered the effectiveness of current supervised learning methods. In this work, we aim to address this issue by exploring an self-supervised dynamic scene reconstruction approach. We introduce EgoMono4D, a novel model that unifies the estimation of multiple variables necessary for Egocentric Monocular 4D reconstruction, including camera intrinsic, camera poses, and video depth, all within a fast feed-forward framework. Starting from pretrained single-frame depth and intrinsic estimation model, we extend it with camera poses estimation and align multi-frame results on large-scale unlabeled egocentric videos. We evaluate EgoMono4D in both in-domain and zero-shot generalization settings, achieving superior performance in dense pointclouds sequence reconstruction compared to all baselines. EgoMono4D represents the first attempt to apply self-supervised learning for pointclouds sequence reconstruction to the label-scarce egocentric field, enabling fast, dense, and generalizable reconstruction. The interactable visualization, code and trained models are released https://egomono4d.github.io/

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks. Codes are available at: https://github.com/zdk258/CorrCLIP.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a large VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we construct the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose a test-time stage-wise retracing search method (SWIRES), which enables effective and efficient test-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and test-time scaling, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 9.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image editing models have made remarkable progress in recent years. However, achieving high-quality video editing remains a significant challenge. One major hurdle is the absence of open-source, large-scale video editing datasets based on real-world data, as constructing such datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Moreover, video data requires a significantly larger number of tokens for representation, which substantially increases the training costs for video editing models. Lastly, current video editing models offer limited interactivity, often making it difficult for users to express their editing requirements effectively in a single attempt. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a dataset VIVID-10M and a baseline model VIVID. VIVID-10M is the first large-scale hybrid image-video local editing dataset aimed at reducing data construction and model training costs, which comprises 9.7M samples that encompass a wide range of video editing tasks. VIVID is a Versatile and Interactive VIdeo local eDiting model trained on VIVID-10M, which supports entity addition, modification, and deletion. At its core, a keyframe-guided interactive video editing mechanism is proposed, enabling users to iteratively edit keyframes and propagate it to other frames, thereby reducing latency in achieving desired outcomes. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video local editing, surpassing baseline methods in both automated metrics and user studies. The VIVID-10M dataset are open-sourced at https://kwaivgi.github.io/VIVID/.

Abstract: This paper introduces Neuro-Activated Vision Explanations (NAVE), a method for extracting and visualizing the internal representations of vision model encoders. By clustering feature activations, NAVE provides insights into learned semantics without fine-tuning. Using object localization, we show that NAVE's concepts align with image semantics. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the impact of training strategies and architectures on encoder representation capabilities. Additionally, we apply NAVE to study training artifacts in vision transformers and reveal how weak training strategies and spurious correlations degrade model performance. Our findings establish NAVE as a valuable tool for post-hoc model inspection and improving transparency in vision models.

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV.

Abstract: Despite the recent strides in video generation, state-of-the-art methods still struggle with elements of visual detail. One particularly challenging case is the class of videos in which the intricate motion of the hand coupled with a mostly stable and otherwise distracting environment is necessary to convey the execution of some complex action and its effects. To address these challenges, we introduce a new method for video generation that focuses on hand-centric actions. Our diffusion-based method incorporates two distinct innovations. First, we propose an automatic method to generate the motion area -- the region in the video in which the detailed activities occur -- guided by both the visual context and the action text prompt, rather than assuming this region can be provided manually as is now commonplace. Second, we introduce a critical Hand Refinement Loss to guide the diffusion model to focus on smooth and consistent hand poses. We evaluate our method on challenging augmented datasets based on EpicKitchens and Ego4D, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of action clarity, especially of the hand motion in the target region, across diverse environments and actions.

Abstract: 3D semantic field learning is crucial for applications like autonomous navigation, AR/VR, and robotics, where accurate comprehension of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints is essential. Existing methods struggle under sparse view conditions, relying on inefficient per-scene multi-view optimizations, which are impractical for many real-world tasks. To address this, we propose SLGaussian, a feed-forward method for constructing 3D semantic fields from sparse viewpoints, allowing direct inference of 3DGS-based scenes. By ensuring consistent SAM segmentations through video tracking and using low-dimensional indexing for high-dimensional CLIP features, SLGaussian efficiently embeds language information in 3D space, offering a robust solution for accurate 3D scene understanding under sparse view conditions. In experiments on two-view sparse 3D object querying and segmentation in the LERF and 3D-OVS datasets, SLGaussian outperforms existing methods in chosen IoU, Localization Accuracy, and mIoU. Moreover, our model achieves scene inference in under 30 seconds and open-vocabulary querying in just 0.011 seconds per query.

Abstract: Oriented object detection in aerial images poses a significant challenge due to their varying sizes and orientations. Current state-of-the-art detectors typically rely on either two-stage or one-stage approaches, often employing Anchor-based strategies, which can result in computationally expensive operations due to the redundant number of generated anchors during training. In contrast, Anchor-free mechanisms offer faster processing but suffer from a reduction in the number of training samples, potentially impacting detection accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose the Hybrid-Anchor Rotation Detector (HA-RDet), which combines the advantages of both anchor-based and anchor-free schemes for oriented object detection. By utilizing only one preset anchor for each location on the feature maps and refining these anchors with our Orientation-Aware Convolution technique, HA-RDet achieves competitive accuracies, including 75.41 mAP on DOTA-v1, 65.3 mAP on DIOR-R, and 90.2 mAP on HRSC2016, against current anchor-based state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing computational resources.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary Scene Graph Generation (OV-SGG) overcomes the limitations of the closed-set assumption by aligning visual relationship representations with open-vocabulary textual representations. This enables the identification of novel visual relationships, making it applicable to real-world scenarios with diverse relationships. However, existing OV-SGG methods are constrained by fixed text representations, limiting diversity and accuracy in image-text alignment. To address these challenges, we propose the Relation-Aware Hierarchical Prompting (RAHP) framework, which enhances text representation by integrating subject-object and region-specific relation information. Our approach utilizes entity clustering to address the complexity of relation triplet categories, enabling the effective integration of subject-object information. Additionally, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate detailed region-aware prompts, capturing fine-grained visual interactions and improving alignment between visual and textual modalities. RAHP also introduces a dynamic selection mechanism within Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which adaptively selects relevant text prompts based on the visual content, reducing noise from irrelevant prompts. Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome and Open Images v6 datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of open-vocabulary scene graph generation.

Abstract: Long-context video modeling is critical for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling them to process movies, online video streams, and so on. Despite its advances, handling long videos remains challenging due to the difficulty in efficiently understanding the extremely long video context. This paper aims to address this issue from aspects of model architecture, training data, training strategy and evaluation benchmark. First, we propose a novel Hierarchical video token Compression (HiCo) method, which leverages visual redundancy in long videos to compress long video context from Clip-level to Video-level, reducing the computation significantly while preserving essential details, achieving an extreme compression ratio of approximately 1/50 with almost no performance loss. Second, we introduce a multi-stage short-to-long learning scheme, a large-scale dataset of real-world long videos named LongVid, and a challenging ``Multi-Hop Needle-In-A-Video-Haystack'' benchmark. Finally, we build a powerful video MLLM named VideoChat-Flash, which shows a leading performance on both mainstream long and short video benchmarks at the 2B and 7B model scale. It first gets 99.1% accuracy over 10,000 frames in NIAH among open-source models.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) has recently revolutionized novel view synthesis in the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. However, most existing algorithms fail to fully capture the underlying structure, resulting in structural inconsistency. Additionally, they struggle with abrupt appearance variations, leading to inconsistent visual quality. To address these problems, we propose SEGS-SLAM, a structure-enhanced 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM, which achieves high-quality photorealistic mapping. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a structure-enhanced photorealistic mapping (SEPM) framework that, for the first time, leverages highly structured point cloud to initialize structured 3D Gaussians, leading to significant improvements in rendering quality. Second, we propose Appearance-from-Motion embedding (AfME), enabling 3D Gaussians to better model image appearance variations across different camera poses. Extensive experiments on monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets demonstrate that SEGS-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in photorealistic mapping quality, e.g., an improvement of $19.86\%$ in PSNR over MonoGS on the TUM RGB-D dataset for monocular cameras.

Abstract: This paper aims to improve the performance of video multimodal large language models (MLLM) via long and rich context (LRC) modeling. As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. Our work highlights the importance of multimodal context richness (length and fineness) in empowering MLLM's innate abilites (focus and memory), providing new insights for future research on video MLLM.

Abstract: This expository paper introduces a simplified approach to image-based quality inspection in manufacturing using OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model adapted for few-shot learning. While CLIP has demonstrated impressive capabilities in general computer vision tasks, its direct application to manufacturing inspection presents challenges due to the domain gap between its training data and industrial applications. We evaluate CLIP's effectiveness through five case studies: metallic pan surface inspection, 3D printing extrusion profile analysis, stochastic textured surface evaluation, automotive assembly inspection, and microstructure image classification. Our results show that CLIP can achieve high classification accuracy with relatively small learning sets (50-100 examples per class) for single-component and texture-based applications. However, the performance degrades with complex multi-component scenes. We provide a practical implementation framework that enables quality engineers to quickly assess CLIP's suitability for their specific applications before pursuing more complex solutions. This work establishes CLIP-based few-shot learning as an effective baseline approach that balances implementation simplicity with robust performance, demonstrated in several manufacturing quality control applications.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in a video according to textual descriptions, which requires the integration of multimodal information and temporal dynamics perception. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown great effectiveness across various video segmentation tasks. However, its application to offline RVOS is challenged by the translation of the text into effective prompts and a lack of global context awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel RVOS framework, termed MPG-SAM 2, to address these challenges. Specifically, MPG-SAM 2 employs a unified multimodal encoder to jointly encode video and textual features, generating semantically aligned video and text embeddings, along with multimodal class tokens. A mask prior generator utilizes the video embeddings and class tokens to create pseudo masks of target objects and global context. These masks are fed into the prompt encoder as dense prompts along with multimodal class tokens as sparse prompts to generate accurate prompts for SAM 2. To provide the online SAM 2 with a global view, we introduce a hierarchical global-historical aggregator, which allows SAM 2 to aggregate global and historical information of target objects at both pixel and object levels, enhancing the target representation and temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on several RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MPG-SAM 2 and the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-image generative models, they are prone to adversarial attacks and inadvertently generate unsafe, unethical content. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning models to remove specific concepts, which is computationally expensive, lacks scalability, and/or compromises generation quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) to enable efficient and interpretable concept manipulation in diffusion models. Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards a given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce a new concept (e.g., photographic style) -- all during test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations. Our method yields an improvement of $\mathbf{20.01\%}$ in unsafe concept removal, is effective in style manipulation, and is $\mathbf{\sim5}$x faster than the current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The growing availability of longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets has facilitated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modeling of disease progression, making it possible to predict future medical scans for individual patients. However, despite significant advancements in AI, current methods continue to face challenges including achieving patient-specific individualization, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency, efficiently utilizing longitudinal data, and managing the substantial memory demands of 3D scans. To address these challenges, we propose Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel spatiotemporal model designed to predict individual-level disease progression in 3D brain MRIs. The key contributions in BrLP are fourfold: (i) it operates in a small latent space, mitigating the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional imaging data; (ii) it explicitly integrates subject metadata to enhance the individualization of predictions; (iii) it incorporates prior knowledge of disease dynamics through an auxiliary model, facilitating the integration of longitudinal data; and (iv) it introduces the Latent Average Stabilization (LAS) algorithm, which (a) enforces spatiotemporal consistency in the predicted progression at inference time and (b) allows us to derive a measure of the uncertainty for the prediction at the global and voxel level. We train and evaluate BrLP on 11,730 T1-weighted (T1w) brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects and validate its generalizability on an external test set comprising 2,257 MRIs from 962 subjects. Our experiments compare BrLP-generated MRI scans with real follow-up MRIs, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image restoration tasks. However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code is released at https://github.com/jp-guo/CODiff.

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-trajectory-guided image-to-video generation offer higher precision and better support for complex camera control compared to text-based approaches. However, they also introduce significant usability challenges, as users often struggle to provide precise camera parameters when working with arbitrary real-world images without knowledge of their depth nor scene scale. To address these real-world application issues, we propose RealCam-I2V, a novel diffusion-based video generation framework that integrates monocular metric depth estimation to establish 3D scene reconstruction in a preprocessing step. During training, the reconstructed 3D scene enables scaling camera parameters from relative to metric scales, ensuring compatibility and scale consistency across diverse real-world images. In inference, RealCam-I2V offers an intuitive interface where users can precisely draw camera trajectories by dragging within the 3D scene. To further enhance precise camera control and scene consistency, we propose scene-constrained noise shaping, which shapes high-level noise and also allows the framework to maintain dynamic and coherent video generation in lower noise stages. RealCam-I2V achieves significant improvements in controllability and video quality on the RealEstate10K and out-of-domain images. We further enables applications like camera-controlled looping video generation and generative frame interpolation. Project page: https://zgctroy.github.io/RealCam-I2V.

Abstract: A small but growing body of work has shown that machine learning models which better align with human vision have also exhibited higher robustness to adversarial examples, raising the question: can human-like perception make models more secure? If true generally, such mechanisms would offer new avenues toward robustness. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis to systematically investigate the relationship between representational alignment and adversarial robustness. We evaluate 114 models spanning diverse architectures and training paradigms, measuring their neural and behavioral alignment and engineering task performance across 105 benchmarks as well as their adversarial robustness via AutoAttack. Our findings reveal that while average alignment and robustness exhibit a weak overall correlation, specific alignment benchmarks serve as strong predictors of adversarial robustness, particularly those that measure selectivity toward texture or shape. These results suggest that different forms of alignment play distinct roles in model robustness, motivating further investigation into how alignment-driven approaches can be leveraged to build more secure and perceptually-grounded vision models.

Abstract: Vision-based occupancy networks (VONs) provide an end-to-end solution for reconstructing 3D environments in autonomous driving. However, existing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistencies, manifesting as flickering effects that compromise visual experience and adversely affect decision-making. While recent approaches have incorporated historical data to mitigate the issue, they often incur high computational costs and may introduce noisy information that interferes with object detection. We propose OccLinker, a novel plugin framework designed to seamlessly integrate with existing VONs for boosting performance. Our method efficiently consolidates historical static and motion cues, learns sparse latent correlations with current features through a dual cross-attention mechanism, and produces correction occupancy components to refine the base network's predictions. We propose a new temporal consistency metric to quantitatively identify flickering effects. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior performance with negligible computational overhead, while effectively eliminating flickering artifacts.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in diffusion-based image generation, subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing remain challenging. Existing methods typically treat them separately, struggling with limited high-quality data and poor generalization. However, both tasks require capturing complex visual variations while maintaining consistency between inputs and outputs. Inspired by this, we propose MIGE, a unified framework that standardizes task representations using multimodal instructions. It first treats subject-driven generation as creation on a blank canvas and instruction-based editing as modification of an existing image, establishing a shared input-output formulation, then introduces a novel multimodal encoder that maps free-form multimodal instructions into a unified vision-language space, integrating visual and semantic features through a feature fusion mechanism. This unification enables joint training of both tasks, providing two key advantages: (1) Cross-Task Enhancement: by leveraging shared visual and semantic representations, joint training improves instruction adherence and visual consistency in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing. (2) Generalization: learning in a unified format facilitates cross-task knowledge transfer, enabling MIGE to generalize to novel compositional tasks, including instruction-based subject-driven editing. Experiments show that MIGE excels in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing while setting a SOTA in the new task of instruction-based subject-driven editing.

Abstract: Registration of diffusion MRI tractography is an essential step for analyzing group similarities and variations in the brain's white matter (WM). Streamline-based registration approaches can leverage the 3D geometric information of fiber pathways to enable spatial alignment after registration. Existing methods usually rely on the optimization of the spatial distances to identify the optimal transformation. However, such methods overlook point connectivity patterns within the streamline itself, limiting their ability to identify anatomical correspondences across tractography datasets. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised approach using deep learning to perform streamline-based dMRI tractography registration. The overall idea is to identify corresponding keypoint pairs across subjects for spatial alignment of tractography datasets. We model tractography as point clouds to leverage the graph connectivity along streamlines. We propose a novel keypoint detection method for streamlines, framed as a probabilistic classification task to identify anatomically consistent correspondences across unstructured streamline sets. In the experiments, we compare several existing methods and show highly effective and efficient tractography registration performance.

Abstract: Due to the significant effort required for data collection and annotation in 3D perception tasks, mixed sample data augmentation (MSDA) has been widely studied to generate diverse training samples by mixing existing data. Recently, many MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly target LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA methods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these techniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular distribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar setups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware PillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar level in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a single mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to each pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different classes, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large vehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse objects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This class-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new information, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance but also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street and K-Radar). We believe that this straightforward yet effective approach will spark further investigation into MSDA techniques for radar data.

Abstract: Developing advanced medical imaging retrieval systems is challenging due to the varying definitions of `similar images' across different medical contexts. This challenge is compounded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality medical imaging retrieval datasets and benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that leverages dense radiology reports to define image-wise similarity ordering at multiple granularities in a scalable and fully automatic manner. Using this approach, we construct two comprehensive medical imaging retrieval datasets: MIMIC-IR for Chest X-rays and CTRATE-IR for CT scans, providing detailed image-image ranking annotations conditioned on diverse anatomical structures. Furthermore, we develop two retrieval systems, RadIR-CXR and model-ChestCT, which demonstrate superior performance in traditional image-image and image-report retrieval tasks. These systems also enable flexible, effective image retrieval conditioned on specific anatomical structures described in text, achieving state-of-the-art results on 77 out of 78 metrics.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention due to its high-quality novel view rendering, motivating research to address real-world challenges. A critical issue is the camera motion blur caused by movement during exposure, which hinders accurate 3D scene reconstruction. In this study, we propose CoMoGaussian, a Continuous Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting that reconstructs precise 3D scenes from motion-blurred images while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Considering the complex motion patterns inherent in real-world camera movements, we predict continuous camera trajectories using neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To ensure accurate modeling, we employ rigid body transformations, preserving the shape and size of the object but rely on the discrete integration of sampled frames. To better approximate the continuous nature of motion blur, we introduce a continuous motion refinement (CMR) transformation that refines rigid transformations by incorporating additional learnable parameters. By revisiting fundamental camera theory and leveraging advanced neural ODE techniques, we achieve precise modeling of continuous camera trajectories, leading to improved reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets, which include a wide range of motion blur scenarios, from moderate to extreme blur.

Abstract: Dense point tracking is a challenging task requiring the continuous tracking of every point in the initial frame throughout a substantial portion of a video, even in the presence of occlusions. Traditional methods use optical flow models to directly estimate long-range motion, but they often suffer from appearance drifting without considering temporal consistency. Recent point tracking algorithms usually depend on sliding windows for indirect information propagation from the first frame to the current one, which is slow and less effective for long-range tracking. To account for temporal consistency and enable efficient information propagation, we present a lightweight and fast model with \textbf{S}treaming memory for dense \textbf{PO}int \textbf{T}racking and online video processing. The \textbf{SPOT} framework features three core components: a customized memory reading module for feature enhancement, a sensory memory for short-term motion dynamics modeling, and a visibility-guided splatting module for accurate information propagation. This combination enables SPOT to perform dense point tracking with state-of-the-art accuracy on the CVO benchmark, as well as comparable or superior performance to offline models on sparse tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP. Notably, SPOT with 10$\times$ smaller parameter numbers operates at least 2$\times$ faster than previous state-of-the-art models while maintaining the best performance on CVO. We will release the models and codes at: https://dqiaole.github.io/SPOT/.

Abstract: Image assessment aims to evaluate the quality and aesthetics of images and has been applied across various scenarios, such as natural and AIGC scenes. Existing methods mostly address these sub-tasks or scenes individually. While some works attempt to develop unified image assessment models, they have struggled to achieve satisfactory performance or cover a broad spectrum of assessment scenarios. In this paper, we present \textbf{Gamma}, a \textbf{G}eneric im\textbf{A}ge assess\textbf{M}ent model using \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{A}ssessment Experts, which can effectively assess images from diverse scenes through mixed-dataset training. Achieving unified training in image assessment presents significant challenges due to annotation biases across different datasets. To address this issue, we first propose a Mixture of Assessment Experts (MoAE) module, which employs shared and adaptive experts to dynamically learn common and specific knowledge for different datasets, respectively. In addition, we introduce a Scene-based Differential Prompt (SDP) strategy, which uses scene-specific prompts to provide prior knowledge and guidance during the learning process, further boosting adaptation for various scenes. Our Gamma model is trained and evaluated on 12 datasets spanning 6 image assessment scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our unified Gamma outperforms other state-of-the-art mixed-training methods by significant margins while covering more scenes. Codes are available at https://github.com/zht8506/Gamma.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial in maintaining performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) when facing distribution shifts, particularly when the source data or target labels are inaccessible. Existing TTA methods predominantly leverage the output probability distribution of CLIP for feature evaluation, resulting in biases under domain shifts, which cause misclassified features due to text priors or incorrect textual associations. To address these issues, we propose \underline{B}idirectional Prototype-Reward co-Evolution (BPRE), a novel VLMs framework with TTA that integrates feature quality assessment with prototype evolution via a synergistic feedback loop. First, the Multi-dimensional Quality-aware Reward Module (MQRM) is designed to evaluate feature quality and guide prototype refinement precisely. The continuous refinement of prototype quality via Prototype-Reward Interactive Evolution (PRIE) enhances the computation more robust. Through this bidirectional interaction, the precision of rewards and prototype evolution mutually reinforce each other, forming a self-evolving feedback cycle. Extensive experiments conducted on 15 diverse recognition datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves superior performance compared to other SOTA methods, and advances VLM generalization capabilities through emphasizing comprehensive feature evaluation.

Abstract: Existing MLLMs encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our method consists of four key steps: 1) Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2) Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos to improve the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3) Action: Agents answer long video questions and exchange reasons. 4) Reflection: We evaluate each agent's performance in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (like GPT-4o) and open-source models (like InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80\% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, LVAgent improves accuracy by 13.3\% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Video Individual Counting (VIC) has received increasing attention for its importance in intelligent video surveillance. Existing works are limited in two aspects, i.e., dataset and method. Previous datasets are captured with fixed or rarely moving cameras with relatively sparse individuals, restricting evaluation for a highly varying view and time in crowded scenes. Existing methods rely on localization followed by association or classification, which struggle under dense and dynamic conditions due to inaccurate localization of small targets. To address these issues, we introduce the MovingDroneCrowd Dataset, featuring videos captured by fast-moving drones in crowded scenes under diverse illuminations, shooting heights and angles. We further propose a Shared Density map-guided Network (SDNet) using a Depth-wise Cross-Frame Attention (DCFA) module to directly estimate shared density maps between consecutive frames, from which the inflow and outflow density maps are derived by subtracting the shared density maps from the global density maps. The inflow density maps across frames are summed up to obtain the number of unique pedestrians in a video. Experiments on our datasets and publicly available ones show the superiority of our method over the state of the arts in highly dynamic and complex crowded scenes. Our dataset and codes have been released publicly.

Abstract: Stereo images are fundamental to numerous applications, including extended reality (XR) devices, autonomous driving, and robotics. Unfortunately, acquiring high-quality stereo images remains challenging due to the precise calibration requirements of dual-camera setups and the complexity of obtaining accurate, dense disparity maps. Existing stereo image generation methods typically focus on either visual quality for viewing or geometric accuracy for matching, but not both. We introduce GenStereo, a diffusion-based approach, to bridge this gap. The method includes two primary innovations (1) conditioning the diffusion process on a disparity-aware coordinate embedding and a warped input image, allowing for more precise stereo alignment than previous methods, and (2) an adaptive fusion mechanism that intelligently combines the diffusion-generated image with a warped image, improving both realism and disparity consistency. Through extensive training on 11 diverse stereo datasets, GenStereo demonstrates strong generalization ability. GenStereo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both stereo image generation and unsupervised stereo matching tasks. Project page is available at https://qjizhi.github.io/genstereo.

Abstract: Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point clouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network architectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets. Our code is publicly available for research purpose at https://easi3r.github.io/

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on modeling cross-domain preferences through intra- and inter-sequence item relationships. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose Hierarchical Attention Fusion of Visual and Textual Representations (HAF-VT), a novel approach integrating visual and textual data to enhance cognitive modeling. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text embeddings, enriching item representations with multimodal data. A hierarchical attention mechanism jointly learns single-domain and cross-domain preferences, mimicking human information integration. Evaluated on four e-commerce datasets, HAF-VT outperforms existing methods in capturing cross-domain user interests, bridging cognitive principles with computational models and highlighting the role of multimodal data in sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances environmental awareness through inter-agent communication and is regarded as a promising solution to intelligent transportation systems. However, existing collaborative methods for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) overlook the unique characteristics of the UAV perspective, resulting in substantial communication overhead. To address this issue, we propose a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception framework based on late-intermediate fusion, dubbed LIF. The core concept is to exchange informative and compact detection results and shift the fusion stage to the feature representation level. In particular, we leverage vision-guided positional embedding (VPE) and box-based virtual augmented feature (BoBEV) to effectively integrate complementary information from various agents. Additionally, we innovatively introduce an uncertainty-driven communication mechanism that uses uncertainty evaluation to select high-quality and reliable shared areas. Experimental results demonstrate that our LIF achieves superior performance with minimal communication bandwidth, proving its effectiveness and practicality. Code and models are available at https://github.com/uestchjw/LIF.

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy. To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.

Abstract: Gait recognition enables contact-free, long-range person identification that is robust to clothing variations and non-cooperative scenarios. While existing methods perform well in controlled indoor environments, they struggle with cross-vertical view scenarios, where surveillance angles vary significantly in elevation. Our experiments show up to 60\% accuracy degradation in low-to-high vertical view settings due to severe deformations and self-occlusions of key anatomical features. Current CNN and self-attention-based methods fail to effectively handle these challenges, due to their reliance on single-scale convolutions or simplistic attention mechanisms that lack effective multi-frequency feature integration. To tackle this challenge, we propose CVVNet (Cross-Vertical-View Network), a frequency aggregation architecture specifically designed for robust cross-vertical-view gait recognition. CVVNet employs a High-Low Frequency Extraction module (HLFE) that adopts parallel multi-scale convolution/max-pooling path and self-attention path as high- and low-frequency mixers for effective multi-frequency feature extraction from input silhouettes. We also introduce the Dynamic Gated Aggregation (DGA) mechanism to adaptively adjust the fusion ratio of high- and low-frequency features. The integration of our core Multi-Scale Attention Gated Aggregation (MSAGA) module, HLFE and DGA enables CVVNet to effectively handle distortions from view changes, significantly improving the recognition robustness across different vertical views. Experimental results show that our CVVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with $8.6\%$ improvement on DroneGait and $2\%$ on Gait3D compared with the best existing methods.

Abstract: We present a method for Sparse view reconstruction with surface element splatting that runs within 3 minutes on a consumer grade GPU. While few methods address sparse radiance field learning from noisy or unposed sparse cameras, shape recovery remains relatively underexplored in this setting. Several radiance and shape learning test-time optimization methods address the sparse posed setting by learning data priors or using combinations of external monocular geometry priors. Differently, we propose an efficient and simple pipeline harnessing a single recent 3D foundation model. We leverage its various task heads, notably point maps and camera initializations to instantiate a bundle adjusting 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) model, and image correspondences to guide camera optimization midst 2DGS training. Key to our contribution is a novel formulation of splatted color variance along rays, which can be computed efficiently. Reducing this moment in training leads to more accurate shape reconstructions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performances in the sparse uncalibrated setting in reconstruction and novel view benchmarks based on established multi-view datasets.

<title>VGLD: Visually-Guided Linguistic Disambiguation for Monocular Depth Scale Recovery</title>

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation can be broadly categorized into two directions: relative depth estimation, which predicts normalized or inverse depth without absolute scale, and metric depth estimation, which aims to recover depth with real-world scale. While relative methods are flexible and data-efficient, their lack of metric scale limits their utility in downstream tasks. A promising solution is to infer absolute scale from textual descriptions. However, such language-based recovery is highly sensitive to natural language ambiguity, as the same image may be described differently across perspectives and styles. To address this, we introduce VGLD (Visually-Guided Linguistic Disambiguation), a framework that incorporates high-level visual semantics to resolve ambiguity in textual inputs. By jointly encoding both image and text, VGLD predicts a set of global linear transformation parameters that align relative depth maps with metric scale. This visually grounded disambiguation improves the stability and accuracy of scale estimation. We evaluate VGLD on representative models, including MiDaS and DepthAnything, using standard indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) benchmarks. Results show that VGLD significantly mitigates scale estimation bias caused by inconsistent or ambiguous language, achieving robust and accurate metric predictions. Moreover, when trained on multiple datasets, VGLD functions as a universal and lightweight alignment module, maintaining strong performance even in zero-shot settings. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: In low-light environments, the performance of computer vision algorithms often deteriorates significantly, adversely affecting key vision tasks such as segmentation, detection, and classification. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, its application to low-light image processing has attracted widespread attention and seen significant progress in recent years. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically examine how recent deep-learning-based low-light image enhancement methods function and evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing downstream vision tasks. To address this gap, this review provides detailed elaboration on how various recent approaches (from 2020) operate and their enhancement mechanisms, supplemented with clear illustrations. It also investigates the impact of different enhancement techniques on subsequent vision tasks, critically analyzing their strengths and limitations. Our review found that image enhancement improved the performance of downstream vision tasks to varying degrees. Although supervised methods often produced images with high perceptual quality, they typically produced modest improvements in vision tasks. In contrast, zero-shot learning, despite achieving lower scores in image quality metrics, showed consistently boosted performance across various vision tasks. These suggest a disconnect between image quality metrics and those evaluating vision task performance. Additionally, unsupervised domain adaptation techniques demonstrated significant gains in segmentation tasks, highlighting their potential in practical low-light scenarios where labelled data is scarce. Observed limitations of existing studies are analyzed, and directions for future research are proposed. This review serves as a useful reference for determining low-light image enhancement techniques and optimizing vision task performance in low-light conditions.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) for segmentation aims at adapting a model trained in the source domain to perform well in the target domain with only the source model and unlabeled target data. Inspired by the recent success of Segment Anything Model (SAM) which exhibits the generality of segmenting images of various modalities and in different domains given human-annotated prompts like bounding boxes or points, we for the first time explore the potentials of Segment Anything Model for SFDA via automatedly finding an accurate bounding box prompt. We find that the bounding boxes directly generated with existing SFDA approaches are defective due to the domain gap. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Dual Feature Guided (DFG) auto-prompting approach to search for the box prompt. Specifically, the source model is first trained in a feature aggregation phase, which not only preliminarily adapts the source model to the target domain but also builds a feature distribution well-prepared for box prompt search. In the second phase, based on two feature distribution observations, we gradually expand the box prompt with the guidance of the target model feature and the SAM feature to handle the class-wise clustered target features and the class-wise dispersed target features, respectively. To remove the potentially enlarged false positive regions caused by the over-confident prediction of the target model, the refined pseudo-labels produced by SAM are further postprocessed based on connectivity analysis. Experiments on 3D and 2D datasets indicate that our approach yields superior performance compared to conventional methods. Code is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/DFG.

Abstract: Image degradation synthesis is highly desirable in a wide variety of applications ranging from image restoration to simulating artistic effects. Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code, and dataset of this project will be released at github.com/yangwenbo99/content-degradation-disentanglement.

Abstract: PAD and FFD are proposed to protect face data from physical media-based Presentation Attacks and digital editing-based DeepFakes, respectively. However, isolated training of these two models significantly increases vulnerability towards unknown attacks, burdening deployment environments. The lack of a Unified Face Attack Detection model to simultaneously handle attacks in these two categories is mainly attributed to two factors: (1) A benchmark that is sufficient for models to explore is lacking. Existing UAD datasets only contain limited attack types and samples, leading to the model's confined ability to address abundant advanced threats. In light of these, through an explainable hierarchical way, we propose the most extensive and sophisticated collection of forgery techniques available to date, namely UniAttackDataPlus. Our UniAttackData+ encompasses 2,875 identities and their 54 kinds of corresponding falsified samples, in a total of 697,347 videos. (2) The absence of a trustworthy classification criterion. Current methods endeavor to explore an arbitrary criterion within the same semantic space, which fails to exist when encountering diverse attacks. Thus, we present a novel Visual-Language Model-based Hierarchical Prompt Tuning Framework that adaptively explores multiple classification criteria from different semantic spaces. Specifically, we construct a VP-Tree to explore various classification rules hierarchically. Then, by adaptively pruning the prompts, the model can select the most suitable prompts guiding the encoder to extract discriminative features at different levels in a coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, to help the model understand the classification criteria in visual space, we propose a DPI module to project the visual prompts to the text encoder to help obtain a more accurate semantics.

Abstract: Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues. To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets: DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased detectors.

Abstract: Multispectral object detection aims to leverage complementary information from visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) modalities to enable robust performance under diverse environmental conditions. Our key insight, derived from wavelet analysis and empirical observations, is that IR images contain structurally rich high-frequency information critical for object detection, making an infrared-centric approach highly effective. To capitalize on this finding, we propose Infrared-Centric Fusion (IC-Fusion), a lightweight and modality-aware sensor fusion method that prioritizes infrared features while effectively integrating complementary RGB semantic context. IC-Fusion adopts a compact RGB backbone and designs a novel fusion module comprising a Multi-Scale Feature Distillation (MSFD) block to enhance RGB features and a three-stage fusion block with a Cross-Modal Channel Shuffle Gate (CCSG), a Cross-Modal Large Kernel Gate (CLKG), and a Channel Shuffle Projection (CSP) to facilitate effective cross-modal interaction. Experiments on the FLIR and LLVIP benchmarks demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our IR-centric fusion strategy, further validating its benefits.

<title>Spiking Transformers Need High Frequency Information</title>

Abstract: Spiking Transformers offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning by transmitting information solely through binary (0/1) spikes. However, there remains a substantial performance gap compared to artificial neural networks. A common belief is that their binary and sparse activation transmission leads to information loss, thus degrading feature representation and accuracy. In this work, however, we reveal for the first time that spiking neurons preferentially propagate low-frequency information. We hypothesize that the rapid dissipation of high-frequency components is the primary cause of performance degradation. For example, on Cifar-100, adopting Avg-Pooling (low-pass) for token mixing lowers performance to 76.73%; interestingly, replacing it with Max-Pooling (high-pass) pushes the top-1 accuracy to 79.12%, surpassing the well-tuned Spikformer baseline by 0.97%. Accordingly, we introduce Max-Former that restores high-frequency signals through two frequency-enhancing operators: extra Max-Pooling in patch embedding and Depth-Wise Convolution in place of self-attention. Notably, our Max-Former (63.99 M) hits the top-1 accuracy of 82.39% on ImageNet, showing a +7.58% improvement over Spikformer with comparable model size (74.81%, 66.34 M). We hope this simple yet effective solution inspires future research to explore the distinctive nature of spiking neural networks, beyond the established practice in standard deep learning. \href{https://github.com/bic-L/Spiking-Transformers-Need-High-Frequency-Information}{Code} is available.

<title>Holistic White-light Polyp Classification via Alignment-free Dense Distillation of Auxiliary Optical Chromoendoscopy</title>

Abstract: White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are the two main colonoscopic modalities for polyp classification. While NBI, as optical chromoendoscopy, offers valuable vascular details, WLI remains the most common and often the only available modality in resource-limited settings. However, WLI-based methods typically underperform, limiting their clinical applicability. Existing approaches transfer knowledge from NBI to WLI through global feature alignment but often rely on cropped lesion regions, which are susceptible to detection errors and neglect contextual and subtle diagnostic cues. To address this, this paper proposes a novel holistic classification framework that leverages full-image diagnosis without requiring polyp localization. The key innovation lies in the Alignment-free Dense Distillation (ADD) module, which enables fine-grained cross-domain knowledge distillation regardless of misalignment between WLI and NBI images. Without resorting to explicit image alignment, ADD learns pixel-wise cross-domain affinities to establish correspondences between feature maps, guiding the distillation along the most relevant pixel connections. To further enhance distillation reliability, ADD incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to filter cross-domain affinities, ensuring the distillation path connects only those semantically consistent regions with equal contributions to polyp diagnosis. Extensive results on public and in-house datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, relatively outperforming the other approaches by at least 2.5% and 16.2% in AUC, respectively.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many visual generation and manipulation tasks. Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines. Our models and source codes are available at https://github.com/leeruibin/MfM.git.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT) module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\% detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial 33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.

<title>RealKeyMorph: Keypoints in Real-world Coordinates for Resolution-agnostic Image Registration</title>

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view. However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as 3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.

Abstract: This paper presents a two-year research project focused on developing AI-driven measures to analyze classroom dynamics, with particular emphasis on teacher actions captured through multimodal sensor data. We applied real-time data from classroom sensors and AI techniques to extract meaningful insights and support teacher development. Key outcomes include a curated audio-visual dataset, novel behavioral measures, and a proof-of-concept teaching review dashboard. An initial evaluation with eight researchers from the National Institute for Education (NIE) highlighted the system's clarity, usability, and its non-judgmental, automated analysis approach -- which reduces manual workloads and encourages constructive reflection. Although the current version does not assign performance ratings, it provides an objective snapshot of in-class interactions, helping teachers recognize and improve their instructional strategies. Designed and tested in an Asian educational context, this work also contributes a culturally grounded methodology to the growing field of AI-based educational analytics.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from 2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts, all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR), and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data, progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets. BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models, including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2- patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

Abstract: Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing equipment damage due to procedural errors and ensuring worker safety. Although commercial solutions exist, they typically require rigid workspace setups or the application of visual markers to simplify the problem. We introduce ViMAT, a novel AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks that operates without these constraints. ViMAT combines a perception module that extracts visual observations from multi-view video streams with a reasoning module that infers the most likely action being performed based on the observed assembly state and prior task knowledge. We validate ViMAT on two assembly tasks, involving the replacement of LEGO components and the reconfiguration of hydraulic press molds, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and qualitative analysis in challenging real-world scenarios characterized by partial and uncertain visual observations.

Abstract: Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (\textbf{MV-AR}) method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the ``Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading diffusion-based multi-view image generation models. The code and models are released at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MVAR.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue, law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations, we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS, which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs, ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our dataset and baseline method are publicly available on https://github.com/Alioth2000/Hoss-ReID.

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history, economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation, reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.

Abstract: Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects. Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base (86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1) Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2) Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example, with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ycarobot/COCA.

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space. In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of image generative models to augment human creativity.

However, these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians, due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's practical utility.

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention. To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures, achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

<title>MSVD-Indonesian: A Benchmark for Multimodal Video-Text Tasks in Indonesian</title>

Abstract: Multimodal learning on video and text has seen significant progress, particularly in tasks like text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. However, most existing methods and datasets focus exclusively on English. Despite Indonesian being one of the most widely spoken languages, multimodal research in Indonesian remains under-explored, largely due to the lack of benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first public Indonesian video-text dataset by translating the English captions in the MSVD dataset into Indonesian. Using this dataset, we evaluate neural network models which were developed for the English video-text dataset on three tasks, i.e., text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. Most existing models rely on feature extractors pretrained on English vision-language datasets, raising concerns about their applicability to Indonesian, given the scarcity of large-scale pretraining resources in the language. We apply a cross-lingual transfer learning approach by leveraging English-pretrained extractors and fine-tuning models on our Indonesian dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across all tasks and metrics. We release our dataset publicly to support future research and hope it will inspire further progress in Indonesian multimodal learning.

Abstract: Pan-sharpening algorithm utilizes panchromatic image and multispectral image to obtain a high spatial and high spectral image. However, the optimizations of the algorithms are designed with different standards. We adopt the simple matrix equation to describe the Pan-sharpening problem. The solution existence condition and the acquirement of spectral and spatial resolution are discussed. A down-sampling enhancement method was introduced for better acquiring the spatial and spectral down-sample matrices. By the generalized inverse theory, we derived two forms of general inverse matrix formulations that can correspond to the two prominent classes of Pan-sharpening methods, that is, component substitution and multi-resolution analysis methods. Specifically, the Gram Schmidt Adaptive(GSA) was proved to follow the general inverse matrix formulation of component substitution. A model prior to the general inverse matrix of the spectral function was rendered. The theoretical errors are analyzed. Synthetic experiments and real data experiments are implemented. The proposed methods are better and sharper than other methods qualitatively in both synthetic and real experiments. The down-sample enhancement effect is shown of better results both quantitatively and qualitatively in real experiments. The generalized inverse matrix theory help us better understand the Pan-sharpening.

<title>High-Quality Live Video Streaming via Transcoding Time Prediction and Preset Selection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05348</link>

arXiv:2312.05348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video streaming often requires transcoding content into different resolutions and bitrates to match the recipient's internet speed and screen capabilities. Video encoders like x264 offer various presets, each with different tradeoffs between transcoding time and rate-distortion performance. Choosing the best preset for video transcoding is difficult, especially for live streaming, as trying all the presets and choosing the best one is not feasible. One solution is to predict each preset's transcoding time and select the preset that ensures the highest quality while adhering to live streaming time constraints. Prediction of video transcoding time is also critical in minimizing streaming delays, deploying resource management algorithms, and load balancing. We propose a learning-based framework for predicting the transcoding time of videos across various presets. Our predictor's features for video transcoding time prediction are derived directly from the ingested stream, primarily from the header or metadata. As a result, only minimal additional delay is incurred for feature extraction, rendering our approach ideal for live-streaming applications. We evaluated our learning-based transcoding time prediction using a dataset of videos. The results demonstrate that our framework can accurately predict the transcoding time for different presets, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of nearly 5.0%. Leveraging these predictions, we then select the most suitable transcoding preset for live video streaming. Utilizing our transcoding time prediction-based preset selection improved Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of up to 5 dB.

<title>Unmixing Optical Signals from Undersampled Volumetric Measurements by Filtering the Pixel Latent Variables</title>

Abstract: The development of signal unmixing algorithms is essential for leveraging multimodal datasets acquired through a wide array of scientific imaging technologies, including hyperspectral or time-resolved acquisitions. In experimental physics, enhancing the spatio-temporal resolution or expanding the number of detection channels often leads to diminished sampling rate and signal-to-noise ratio, significantly affecting the efficacy of signal unmixing algorithms. We propose Latent Unmixing, a new approach which applies bandpass filters to the latent space of a multidimensional convolutional neural network to disentangle overlapping signal components. It enables better isolation and quantification of individual signal contributions, especially in the context of undersampled distributions. Using multidimensional convolution kernels to process all dimensions simultaneously enhances the network's ability to extract information from adjacent pixels, and time or spectral bins. This approach enables more effective separation of components in cases where individual pixels do not provide clear, well-resolved information. We showcase the method's practical use in experimental physics through two test cases that highlight the versatility of our approach: fluorescence lifetime microscopy and mode decomposition in optical fibers. The latent unmixing method extracts valuable information from complex signals that cannot be resolved by standard methods. It opens up new possibilities in optics and photonics for multichannel separation at an increased sampling rate.

<title>Advancing Automatic Photovoltaic Defect Detection using Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Electroluminescence Images</title>

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) systems allow us to tap into all abundant solar energy, however they require regular maintenance for high efficiency and to prevent degradation. Traditional manual health check, using Electroluminescence (EL) imaging, is expensive and logistically challenging which makes automated defect detection essential. Current automation approaches require extensive manual expert labeling, which is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. We propose PV-S3 (Photovoltaic-Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation), a Semi-Supervised Learning approach for semantic segmentation of defects in EL images that reduces reliance on extensive labeling. PV-S3 is an artificial intelligence (AI) model trained using a few labeled images along with numerous unlabeled images. We introduce a novel Semi Cross-Entropy loss function to deal with class imbalance. We evaluate PV-S3 on multiple datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and adaptability. With merely 20% labeled samples, we achieve an absolute improvement of 9.7% in mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), 13.5% in Precision, 29.15% in Recall, and 20.42% in F1-Score over prior state-of-the-art supervised method (which uses 100% labeled samples) on University of Central Florida-Electroluminescence (UCF-EL) dataset (largest dataset available for semantic segmentation of EL images) showing improvement in performance while reducing the annotation costs by 80%.

<title>GI-NAS: Boosting Gradient Inversion Attacks through Adaptive Neural Architecture Search</title>

Abstract: Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.

Abstract: Molecular assays are standard of care for detecting genomic alterations in cancer prognosis and therapy selection but are costly, tissue-destructive and time-consuming. Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) offers a fast and economical alternative for screening molecular biomarkers. We introduce OmniScreen, a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2 embeddings extracted from 60,529 cancer patients with paired 489-gene MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel and WSIs. Unlike conventional approaches that train separate models for each biomarker, OmniScreen employs a unified model to predict a broad range of clinically relevant biomarkers across cancers, including low-prevalence targets impractical to model individually. OmniScreen reliably identifies therapeutic targets and shared phenotypic features across common and rare tumors. We investigate the biomarker prediction probabilities and accuracies of OmniScreen in relation to tumor area, cohort size, histologic subtype alignment, and pathway-level morphological patterns. These findings underscore the potential of OmniScreen for routine clinical screening.

<title>Random Erasing vs. Model Inversion: A Promising Defense or a False Hope?</title>

Abstract: Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing private training data from machine learning models. While existing defenses primarily concentrate on model-centric approaches, the impact of data on MI robustness remains largely unexplored. In this work, we explore Random Erasing (RE), a technique traditionally used for improving model generalization under occlusion, and uncover its surprising effectiveness as a defense against MI attacks. Specifically, our novel feature space analysis shows that models trained with RE-images introduce a significant discrepancy between the features of MI-reconstructed images and those of the private data. At the same time, features of private images remain distinct from other classes and well-separated from different classification regions. These effects collectively degrade MI reconstruction quality and attack accuracy while maintaining reasonable natural accuracy. Furthermore, we explore two critical properties of RE including Partial Erasure and Random Location. Partial Erasure prevents the model from observing entire objects during training. We find this has a significant impact on MI, which aims to reconstruct the entire objects. Random Location of erasure plays a crucial role in achieving a strong privacy-utility trade-off. Our findings highlight RE as a simple yet effective defense mechanism that can be easily integrated with existing privacy-preserving techniques. Extensive experiments across 37 setups demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the privacy-utility trade-off. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our defense over existing methods across different MI attacks, network architectures, and attack configurations. For the first time, we achieve a significant degradation in attack accuracy without a decrease in utility for some configurations.

Abstract: Document Structured Extraction (DSE) aims to extract structured content from raw documents. Despite the emergence of numerous DSE systems, their unified evaluation remains inadequate, significantly hindering the field's advancement. This problem is largely attributed to existing benchmark paradigms, which exhibit fragmented and localized characteristics. To address these limitations and offer a thorough evaluation of DSE systems, we introduce a novel benchmark named READoc, which defines DSE as a realistic task of converting unstructured PDFs into semantically rich Markdown. The READoc dataset is derived from 3,576 diverse and real-world documents from arXiv, GitHub, and Zenodo. In addition, we develop a DSE Evaluation S$^3$uite comprising Standardization, Segmentation and Scoring modules, to conduct a unified evaluation of state-of-the-art DSE approaches. By evaluating a range of pipeline tools, expert visual models, and general VLMs, we identify the gap between current work and the unified, realistic DSE objective for the first time. We aspire that READoc will catalyze future research in DSE, fostering more comprehensive and practical solutions.

Abstract: Recent work on human animation usually involves audio, pose, or movement maps conditions, thereby achieves vivid animation quality. However, these methods often face practical challenges due to extra control conditions, cumbersome condition injection modules, or limitation to head region driving. Hence, we ask if it is possible to achieve striking half-body human animation while simplifying unnecessary conditions. To this end, we propose a half-body human animation method, dubbed EchoMimicV2, that leverages a novel Audio-Pose Dynamic Harmonization strategy, including Pose Sampling and Audio Diffusion, to enhance half-body details, facial and gestural expressiveness, and meanwhile reduce conditions redundancy. To compensate for the scarcity of half-body data, we utilize Head Partial Attention to seamlessly accommodate headshot data into our training framework, which can be omitted during inference, providing a free lunch for animation. Furthermore, we design the Phase-specific Denoising Loss to guide motion, detail, and low-level quality for animation in specific phases, respectively. Besides, we also present a novel benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of half-body human animation. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that EchoMimicV2 surpasses existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various vision-language tasks. However, it is still unclear how accurately LVLMs can perceive visual information in images. In particular, the capability of LVLMs to perceive geometric information, such as shape, angle, and size, remains insufficiently analyzed, although the perception of these properties is crucial for tasks that require a detailed visual understanding. In this work, we introduce VisOnlyQA, a dataset for evaluating the geometric perception of LVLMs, and reveal that LVLMs often cannot accurately perceive basic geometric information in images, while human performance is nearly perfect. VisOnlyQA consists of 12 tasks that directly ask about geometric information in geometric shapes, charts, chemical structures, and 3D shapes. Our experiments highlight the following findings: (i) State-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with basic geometric perception. 23 LVLMs we evaluate, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro, work poorly on VisOnlyQA. (ii) Additional training data does not resolve this issue. Fine-tuning on the training set of VisOnlyQA is not always effective, even for in-distribution tasks. (iii) LLM may be the bottleneck. LVLMs using stronger LLMs exhibit better geometric perception on VisOnlyQA, while it does not require complex reasoning, suggesting that the way LVLMs process information from visual encoders is a bottleneck. The datasets, code, and model responses are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VisOnlyQA.

<title>A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we present Feynman-Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models - even with off-the-shelf rewards - can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

arXiv:2501.08411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate spatial-temporal (ST) prediction for dynamic systems, such as urban mobility and weather patterns, is crucial but hindered by complex ST correlations and the challenge of concurrently modeling long-term trends with short-term fluctuations. Existing methods often falter in these areas. This paper proposes the BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network (BDMNN), which integrates two key innovations: 1) a bidirectional depth modulation mechanism that dynamically adjusts network depth to comprehensively capture both long-term seasonality and immediate short-term events; and 2) a novel convolutional self-attention cell (CSAC). Critically, unlike many attention mechanisms that can lose spatial acuity, our CSAC is specifically designed to preserve crucial spatial relationships throughout the network, akin to standard convolutional layers, while simultaneously capturing temporal dependencies. Evaluated on real-world urban traffic and precipitation datasets, BDMNN demonstrates significant accuracy improvements, achieving a 12% Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction in urban traffic prediction and a 15% improvement in precipitation forecasting over leading deep learning benchmarks like ConvLSTM, using comparable computational resources. These advancements offer robust ST forecasting for smart city management, disaster prevention, and resource optimization.

<title>WaveNet-SF: A Hybrid Network for Retinal Disease Detection Based on Wavelet Transform in the Spatial-Frequency Domain</title>

Abstract: Retinal diseases are a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness, with timely diagnosis being critical for effective treatment. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become a standard imaging modality for retinal disease diagnosis, but OCT images often suffer from issues such as speckle noise, complex lesion shapes, and varying lesion sizes, making interpretation challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, WaveNet-SF, to enhance retinal disease detection by integrating the spatial-domain and frequency-domain learning. The framework utilizes wavelet transforms to decompose OCT images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling the model to extract both global structural features and fine-grained details. To improve lesion detection, we introduce a Multi-Scale Wavelet Spatial Attention (MSW-SA) module, which enhances the model's focus on regions of interest at multiple scales. Additionally, a High-Frequency Feature Compensation (HFFC) block is incorporated to recover edge information lost during wavelet decomposition, suppress noise, and preserve fine details crucial for lesion detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracies of 97.82% and 99.58% on the OCT-C8 and OCT2017 datasets, respectively, surpassing existing methods. These results demonstrate the efficacy of WaveNet-SF in addressing the challenges of OCT image analysis and its potential as a powerful tool for retinal disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain MRI provides essential complementary information for clinical diagnosis. However, acquiring all modalities in practice is often constrained by time and cost. To address this, various methods have been proposed to generate missing modalities from available ones. Traditional approaches can be broadly categorized into two main types: paired and unpaired methods. While paired methods for synthesizing missing modalities achieve high accuracy, obtaining large-scale paired datasets is typically impractical. In contrast, unpaired methods, though scalable, often fail to preserve critical anatomical features, such as lesions. In this paper, we propose Fully Guided Schr\"odinger Bridge (FGSB), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling high-fidelity generation with extremely limited paired data. Furthermore, when provided with lesion-specific information such as expert annotations, segmentation tools, or simple intensity thresholds for critical regions, FGSB can generate missing modalities while preserving these significant lesion with reduced data requirements. Our model comprises two stages: 1) Generation Phase: Iteratively refines synthetic images using paired target image and Gaussian noise. Training Phase: Learns optimal transformation pathways from source to target modality by mapping all intermediate states, ensuring consistent and high-fidelity synthesis. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that FGSB achieved performance comparable to large-data-trained models, while using only two subjects. Incorporating lesion-specific priors further improves the preservation of clinical features.

Abstract: Many video-to-audio (VTA) methods have been proposed for dubbing silent AI-generated videos. An efficient quality assessment method for AI-generated audio-visual content (AGAV) is crucial for ensuring audio-visual quality. Existing audio-visual quality assessment methods struggle with unique distortions in AGAVs, such as unrealistic and inconsistent elements. To address this, we introduce AGAVQA-3k, the first large-scale AGAV quality assessment dataset, comprising $3,382$ AGAVs from $16$ VTA methods. AGAVQA-3k includes two subsets: AGAVQA-MOS, which provides multi-dimensional scores for audio quality, content consistency, and overall quality, and AGAVQA-Pair, designed for optimal AGAV pair selection. We further propose AGAV-Rater, a LMM-based model that can score AGAVs, as well as audio and music generated from text, across multiple dimensions, and selects the best AGAV generated by VTA methods to present to the user. AGAV-Rater achieves state-of-the-art performance on AGAVQA-3k, Text-to-Audio, and Text-to-Music datasets. Subjective tests also confirm that AGAV-Rater enhances VTA performance and user experience. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/charlotte9524/AGAV-Rater.

We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss, requiring early and accurate assessment to prevent irreversible damage. Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) enables high-resolution retinal imaging, but automated segmentation performance varies, especially in cases with complex fluid and hyperreflective foci (HRF) patterns. This study proposes an active-learning-based deep learning pipeline for automated segmentation of retinal layers, fluid, and HRF, using four state-of-the-art models: U-Net, SegFormer, SwinUNETR, and VM-UNet, trained on expert-annotated SD-OCT volumes. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated with five-fold cross-validation, and retinal thickness was quantified using a K-nearest neighbors algorithm and visualized with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) maps. SwinUNETR achieved the highest overall accuracy (DSC = 0.7719; NSD = 0.8149), while VM-UNet excelled in specific layers. Structural differences were observed between non-proliferative and proliferative DR, with layer-specific thickening correlating with visual acuity impairment. The proposed framework enables robust, clinically relevant DR assessment while reducing the need for manual annotation, supporting improved disease monitoring and treatment planning.

Abstract: SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, remains a global health concern due to its high transmissibility and evolving variants. Although vaccination efforts and therapeutic advancements have mitigated disease severity, emerging mutations continue to challenge diagnostics and containment strategies. As of mid-February 2025, global test positivity has risen to 11%, marking the highest level in over six months despite widespread immunization efforts. Newer variants demonstrate enhanced host cell binding, increasing both infectivity and diagnostic complexity. This study evaluates the effectiveness of deep transfer learning in delivering rapid, accurate, and mutation-resilient COVID-19 diagnosis from medical imaging, with a focus on scalability and accessibility. We developed an automated detection system using state-of-the-art CNNs, including VGG16, ResNet50, ConvNetXtTiny, MobileNet, NASNetMobile, and DenseNet121 among others, to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray and CT images. Among all the models evaluated, DenseNet121 emerged as the best-performing architecture for COVID-19 diagnosis using CT and X-ray images. It achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, with 96.9% precision, 98.9% recall, 97.9% F1-score and 99.8% AUC score, indicating a high degree of consistency and reliability in both detecting positive and negative cases. The confusion matrix showed minimal false positives and false negatives, underscoring the model's robustness in real-world diagnostic scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has become the standard practice for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. However, the impact on model robustness is not well understood. In this work, we characterize the robustness-accuracy trade-off in fine-tuning. We evaluate the robustness and accuracy of fine-tuned models over 6 benchmark datasets and 7 different fine-tuning strategies. We observe a consistent trade-off between adversarial robustness and accuracy. Peripheral updates such as BitFit are more effective for simple tasks -- over 75% above the average measured by the area under the Pareto frontiers on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. In contrast, fine-tuning information-heavy layers, such as attention layers via Compacter, achieves a better Pareto frontier on more complex tasks -- 57.5% and 34.6% above the average on Caltech-256 and CUB-200, respectively. Lastly, we observe that the robustness of fine-tuning against out-of-distribution data closely tracks accuracy. These insights emphasize the need for robustness-aware fine-tuning to ensure reliable real-world deployments.

Abstract: We present our solution for the Multi-Source COVID-19 Detection Challenge, which classifies chest CT scans from four distinct medical centers. To address multi-source variability, we employ the Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL) framework with Kernel-Density-based Slice Sampling (KDS). Our preprocessing pipeline combines lung region extraction, quality control, and adaptive slice sampling to select eight representative slices per scan. We compare EfficientNet and Swin Transformer architectures on the validation set. The EfficientNet model achieves an F1-score of 94.68%, compared to the Swin Transformer's 93.34%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our KDS-based pipeline on multi-source data and highlight the importance of dataset balance in multi-institutional medical imaging evaluation.

Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to recalibrate semantic features. Our two main contributions are: (1) a two-level Haar wavelet head for multi orientation edge extraction; and (2) Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (WEGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with boundary and input branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANet-W consistently outperforms existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while introducing no additional learnable parameters.

Abstract: Accurately analyzing the motion parts and their motion attributes in dynamic environments is crucial for advancing key areas such as embodied intelligence. Addressing the limitations of existing methods that rely on dense multi-view images or detailed part-level annotations, we propose an innovative framework that can analyze 3D mobility from monocular videos in a zero-shot manner. This framework can precisely parse motion parts and motion attributes only using a monocular video, completely eliminating the need for annotated training data. Specifically, our method first constructs the scene geometry and roughly analyzes the motion parts and their initial motion attributes combining depth estimation, optical flow analysis and point cloud registration method, then employs 2D Gaussian splatting for scene representation. Building on this, we introduce an end-to-end dynamic scene optimization algorithm specifically designed for articulated objects, refining the initial analysis results to ensure the system can handle 'rotation', 'translation', and even complex movements ('rotation+translation'), demonstrating high flexibility and versatility. To validate the robustness and wide applicability of our method, we created a comprehensive dataset comprising both simulated and real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that our framework can effectively analyze articulated object motions in an annotation-free manner, showcasing its significant potential in future embodied intelligence applications.

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments. These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many, showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro 1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method, ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder (ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement (COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality, analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches, including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy, low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs. Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters, demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy, and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems for space-based applications.

arXiv:2507.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents, particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a 3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space. Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the $\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view synthesis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$ threat model.

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient, allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems.

<title>HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation. Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust, fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer models.

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging, SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D. These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF 2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling, and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted multi-modal learning.

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large, clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury, lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone video at https://intelligentsensingandrehabilitation.github.io/MonocularBiomechanics/ .

<title>Cross-Resolution SAR Target Detection Using Structural Hierarchy Adaptation and Reliable Adjacency Alignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08290</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However, the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution, the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur, temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS inference speed.

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning. In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40 volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

<title>CoCo-Bot: Energy-based Composable Concept Bottlenecks for Interpretable Generative Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable generative modeling by routing generation through explicit, human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while maintaining competitive visual quality.

<title>Single-Domain Generalization for Multimodal Cross-Cancer Prognosis via Dirac Rebalancer and Distribution Entanglement</title>

arXiv:2507.08340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios, despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space. Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer multimodal prognosis.

<title>Towards Imperceptible JPEG Image Hiding: Multi-range Representations-driven Adversarial Stego Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08343</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

arXiv:2507.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless, its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at https://github.com/ShishuaiHu/CCV.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density, assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition. These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection. Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0% (multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments. Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver assessments.

This survey presents a comprehensive review of video restoration and enhancement techniques with a particular focus on unsupervised approaches. We begin by outlining the most common video degradations and their underlying causes, followed by a review of early conventional and deep learning methods-based, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We then present an in-depth overview of unsupervised methods, categorise by their fundamental approaches, including domain translation, self-supervision signal design and blind spot or noise-based methods. We also provide a categorization of loss functions employed in unsupervised video restoration and enhancement, and discuss the role of paired synthetic datasets in enabling objective evaluation.

<title>From Enhancement to Understanding: Build a Generalized Bridge for Low-light Vision via Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning</title>

arXiv:2507.08380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding, constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding, which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF). Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories. Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties, such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies. Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I) models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion, where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement (IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to yield meaningful results.

<title>Deep Hashing with Semantic Hash Centers for Image Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08404</link>

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval. Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types: point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ, MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets. However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes. Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance. Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71% in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance Conditional Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2) prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts (SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after publication.

<title>InstaScene: Towards Complete 3D Instance Decomposition and Reconstruction from Cluttered Scenes</title>

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques, which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal: decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world. Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually intact objects.

<title>Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated Diffusion Transformers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08422</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.

<title>RePaintGS: Reference-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Realistic and View-Consistent 3D Scene Inpainting</title>

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

<title>Vision Foundation Models as Effective Visual Tokenizers for Autoregressive Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08441</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08441</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation -- achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be released publicly to benefit the community.

<title>Review of Feed-forward 3D Reconstruction: From DUSt3R to VGGT</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08448</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications, including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models, exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

<title>A document is worth a structured record: Principled inductive bias design for document recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08458</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08458</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of future document foundation models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks, thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning. Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022, F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET 2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research and practical clinical deployment.

arXiv:2507.08492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era. While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

<title>Occlusion-Guided Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation for Occluded Person Re-Identification</title>

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts, applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR), which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues. Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

<title>RadiomicsRetrieval: A Customizable Framework for Medical Image Retrieval Using Radiomics Features</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08546</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches. Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging repositories. Our code is available at https://github.com/nainye/RadiomicsRetrieval.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank, enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions, and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2 that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules for memory control in visual object tracking.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes. Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation. DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

<title>Disentangling Instance and Scene Contexts for 3D Semantic Scene Completion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by 17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

arXiv:2507.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a novel multi-modal fusion framework for brain tumor segmentation that integrates spatial-language-vision information through bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy and boundary delineation. Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal Semantic Fusion Adapter (MSFA) integrating 3D MRI data with clinical text descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of 2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

<title>BayesTTA: Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models via Gaussian Discriminant Analysis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08607</link>

arXiv:2507.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting; entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data, adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment. We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets. Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN) for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates, handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be standardized.

<title>OnlineBEV: Recurrent Temporal Fusion in Bird's Eye View Representations for Multi-Camera 3D Perception</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08644</link>

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view (BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations. Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

<title>DatasetAgent: A Novel Multi-Agent System for Auto-Constructing Datasets from Real-World Images</title>

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

<title>Generalizable 7T T1-map Synthesis from 1.5T and 3T T1 MRI with an Efficient Transformer Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08655</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08655</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly, scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts. We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize 7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods: Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding 7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128 slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices), 19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145 slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans, respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/- 4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs, and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using 10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T (0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods. Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical workflows.

<title>ByDeWay: Boost Your multimodal LLM with DEpth prompting in a Training-Free Way</title>

arXiv:2507.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

<title>MoSAiC: Multi-Modal Multi-Label Supervision-Aware Contrastive Learning for Remote Sensing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08683</link>

arXiv:2507.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets. Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO), where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

<title>An Efficient Approach for Muscle Segmentation and 3D Reconstruction Using Keypoint Tracking in MRI Scan</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability. This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

<title>L-CLIPScore: a Lightweight Embedding-based Captioning Metric for Evaluating and Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08710</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08710</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP), which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge. Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore only will cause fail training.

<title>SGPMIL: Sparse Gaussian Process Multiple Instance Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology, which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing \textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty. SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios, low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40 minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping, high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The dataset and the evaluation code are publicly available at: https://github.com/siri-rouser/RoundaboutHD.git

<title>Ensemble of Weak Spectral Total Variation Learners: a PET-CT Case Study</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08735</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08735</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case, orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of 457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

<title>HieraRS: A Hierarchical Segmentation Paradigm for Remote Sensing Enabling Multi-Granularity Interpretation and Cross-Domain Transfer</title>

arXiv:2507.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm, which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism (BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components: Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment (CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition, we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

arXiv:2507.08743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making. A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy, communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible, context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

arXiv:2507.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing. Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.

arXiv:2507.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images, demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications in pattern recognition.

<title>From One to More: Contextual Part Latents for 3D Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3) Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene composition with unprecedented controllability.

<title>CLiFT: Compressive Light-Field Tokens for Compute-Efficient and Adaptive Neural Rendering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as "compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely, given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time, given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach, achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size, rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events. NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction systems.

<title>Lumos-1: On Autoregressive Video Generation from a Unified Model Perspective</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code and models are available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/Lumos.

Abstract: We contribute a comprehensive dataset to study user attention and purchasing behavior on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Previous work has relied on mouse movements as a low-cost large-scale behavioral proxy but also has relied on self-reported ground-truth labels, collected at post-task, which can be inaccurate and prone to biases. To address this limitation, we use an eye tracker to construct an objective ground-truth of continuous visual attention. Our dataset comprises 2,776 transactional queries on Google SERPs, collected from 47 participants, and includes: (1) HTML source files, with CSS and images; (2) rendered SERP screenshots; (3) eye movement data; (4) mouse movement data; (5) bounding boxes of direct display and organic advertisements; and (6) scripts for further preprocessing the data. In this paper we provide an overview of the dataset and baseline experiments (classification tasks) that can inspire researchers about the different possibilities for future work.

Abstract: Conservation and decision-making regarding forest resources necessitate regular forest inventory. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning systems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote and non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and time-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR systems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral information across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Consequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the biochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests. Forest component segmentation is crucial for forest inventory. The synergistic use of spatial and spectral laser information has proven to be beneficial for achieving precise forest semantic segmentation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the potential of MS-LiDAR data, captured by the HeliALS system, providing high-density multispectral point clouds to segment forests into six components: ground, low vegetation, trunks, branches, foliage, and woody debris. Three point-wise 3D deep learning models and one machine learning model, including kernel point convolution, superpoint transformer, point transformer V3, and random forest, are implemented. Our experiments confirm the superior accuracy of the KPConv model. Additionally, various geometric and spectral feature vector scenarios are examined. The highest accuracy is achieved by feeding all three wavelengths (1550 nm, 905 nm, and 532 nm) as the initial features into the deep learning model, resulting in improvements of 33.73% and 32.35% in mean intersection over union (mIoU) and in mean accuracy (mAcc), respectively. This study highlights the excellent potential of multispectral LiDAR for improving the accuracy in fully automated forest component segmentation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed. While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control, existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions. Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at https://github.com/dolphin-in-a-coma/sssumo.

<title>Barriers in Integrating Medical Visual Question Answering into Radiology Workflows: A Scoping Review and Clinicians' Insights</title>

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68 publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1) reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

Abstract: As multimedia content expands, the demand for unified multimodal retrieval (UMR) in real-world applications increases. Recent work leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally, we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2) On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss (MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Social media has amplified the reach of financial influencers known as "finfluencers," who share stock recommendations on platforms like YouTube. Understanding their influence requires analyzing multimodal signals like tone, delivery style, and facial expressions, which extend beyond text-based financial analysis. We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with 6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&amp;P 500 index fund. An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms the S\&amp;P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video inputs. This enables deeper advancements in multimodal financial research. Our code, dataset, and evaluation leaderboard are available under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license.

<title>Cracking Instance Jigsaw Puzzles: An Alternative to Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis</title>

Abstract: While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/MIL-JigsawPuzzles.

Abstract: While total intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) volume is an established stroke biomarker, growing evidence shows this aggregate metric ignores the critical influence of plaque location, since calcification in different segments carries distinct prognostic and procedural risks. However, a finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the \textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$ independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks. Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%} of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis, and procedural planning. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Current challenges in developing foundational models for volumetric imaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stem from the computational complexity of training state-of-the-art architectures in high dimensions and curating sufficiently large datasets of volumes. To address these challenges, we introduce Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction), a train-free method for generating semantically rich embeddings for volumetric data. Raptor leverages a frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing computational complexity while retaining semantic information. Extensive experiments on ten diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively on medical volumes (+3% SuPreM, +6% MISFM, +10% Merlin, +13% VoCo, and +14% SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results highlight the effectiveness and versatility of Raptor as a foundation for advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes.

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity. Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD Bench and DragBench.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks, showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage". Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint, and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps. Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this method into a georeferencing workflow.

Abstract: Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of aligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their representations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete, structured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers. By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1) Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/VSD.

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems, and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models. Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the 'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the 'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the $44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the 'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii) a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation. Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes. We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

Abstract: With the advancement of vision-based autonomous driving technology, pedestrian detection have become an important component for improving traffic safety and driving system robustness. Nevertheless, in complex traffic scenarios, conventional pose estimation approaches frequently fail to accurately reconstruct occluded keypoints, primarily due to obstructions caused by vehicles, vegetation, or architectural elements. To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time occluded pedestrian pose completion framework termed Separation and Dimensionality Reduction-based Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (SDR-GAIN). Unlike previous approaches that train visual models to distinguish occlusion patterns, SDR-GAIN aims to learn human pose directly from the numerical distribution of keypoint coordinates and interpolate missing positions. It employs a self-supervised adversarial learning paradigm to train lightweight generators with residual structures for the imputation of missing pose keypoints. Additionally, it integrates multiple pose standardization techniques to alleviate the difficulty of the learning process. Experiments conducted on the COCO and JAAD datasets demonstrate that SDR-GAIN surpasses conventional machine learning and Transformer-based missing data interpolation algorithms in accurately recovering occluded pedestrian keypoints, while simultaneously achieving microsecond-level real-time inference.

Abstract: The class-agnostic counting (CAC) task has recently been proposed to solve the problem of counting all objects of an arbitrary class with several exemplars given in the input image. To address this challenging task, existing leading methods all resort to density map regression, which renders them impractical for downstream tasks that require object locations and restricts their ability to well explore the scale information of exemplars for supervision. To address the limitations, we propose a novel localization-based CAC approach, termed Scale-modulated Query and Localization Network (SQLNet). It fully explores the scales of exemplars in both the query and localization stages and achieves effective counting by accurately locating each object and predicting its approximate size. Specifically, during the query stage, rich discriminative representations of the target class are acquired by the Hierarchical Exemplars Collaborative Enhancement (HECE) module from the few exemplars through multi-scale exemplar cooperation with equifrequent size prompt embedding. These representations are then fed into the Exemplars-Unified Query Correlation (EUQC) module to interact with the query features in a unified manner and produce the correlated query tensor. In the localization stage, the Scale-aware Multi-head Localization (SAML) module utilizes the query tensor to predict the confidence, location, and size of each potential object. Moreover, a scale-aware localization loss is introduced, which exploits flexible location associations and exemplar scales for supervision to optimize the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SQLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular CAC benchmarks, achieving excellent performance not only in counting accuracy but also in localization and bounding box generation.

Abstract: Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation often produce overconfident results misaligned with empirical observations. Such miscalibration, challenges their clinical translation. We propose to use marginal L1 average calibration error (mL1-ACE) as a novel auxiliary loss function to improve pixel-wise calibration without compromising segmentation quality. We show that this loss, despite using hard binning, is directly differentiable, bypassing the need for approximate but differentiable surrogate or soft binning approaches. Our work also introduces the concept of dataset reliability histograms which generalises standard reliability diagrams for refined visual assessment of calibration in semantic segmentation aggregated at the dataset level. Using mL1-ACE, we reduce average and maximum calibration error by 45% and 55% respectively, maintaining a Dice score of 87% on the BraTS 2021 dataset. We share our code here: https://github.com/cai4cai/ACE-DLIRIS

Abstract: Most dataset distillation methods struggle to accommodate large-scale datasets due to their substantial computational and memory requirements. Recent research has begun to explore scalable disentanglement methods. However, there are still performance bottlenecks and room for optimization in this direction. In this paper, we present a curriculum-based dataset distillation framework aiming to harmonize performance and scalability. This framework strategically distills synthetic images, adhering to a curriculum that transitions from simple to complex. By incorporating curriculum evaluation, we address the issue of previous methods generating images that tend to be homogeneous and simplistic, doing so at a manageable computational cost. Furthermore, we introduce adversarial optimization towards synthetic images to further improve their representativeness and safeguard against their overfitting to the neural network involved in distilling. This enhances the generalization capability of the distilled images across various neural network architectures and also increases their robustness to noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework sets new benchmarks in large-scale dataset distillation, achieving substantial improvements of 11.1\% on Tiny-ImageNet, 9.0\% on ImageNet-1K, and 7.3\% on ImageNet-21K. Our distilled datasets and code are available at https://github.com/MIV-XJTU/CUDD.

Abstract: We propose Amortized Posterior Sampling (APS), a novel variational inference approach for efficient posterior sampling in inverse problems. Our method trains a conditional flow model to minimize the divergence between the variational distribution and the posterior distribution implicitly defined by the diffusion model. This results in a powerful, amortized sampler capable of generating diverse posterior samples with a single neural function evaluation, generalizing across various measurements. Unlike existing methods, our approach is unsupervised, requires no paired training data, and is applicable to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of tasks, including image restoration, manifold signal reconstruction, and climate data imputation. APS significantly outperforms existing approaches in computational efficiency while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, enabling real-time, high-quality solutions to inverse problems across diverse domains.

Abstract: Domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD) has become essential to counter performance degradation caused by distribution shifts between training and deployment domains. However, a critical factor influencing DAOD - context bias resulting from learned foreground-background (FG-BG) associations - has remained underexplored. We address three key questions regarding FG BG associations in object detection: are FG-BG associations encoded during the training, is there a causal relationship between FG-BG associations and detection performance, and is there an effect of FG-BG association on DAOD. To examine how models capture FG BG associations, we analyze class-wise and feature-wise performance degradation using background masking and feature perturbation, measured via change in accuracies (defined as drop rate). To explore the causal role of FG-BG associations, we apply do-calculus on FG-BG pairs guided by class activation mapping (CAM). To quantify the causal influence of FG-BG associations across domains, we propose a novel metric - domain association gradient - defined as the ratio of drop rate to maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Through systematic experiments involving background masking, feature-level perturbations, and CAM, we reveal that convolution-based object detection models encode FG-BG associations. Our results demonstrate that context bias not only exists but causally undermines the generalization capabilities of object detection models across domains. Furthermore, we validate these findings across multiple models and datasets, including state-of-the-art architectures such as ALDI++. This study highlights the necessity of addressing context bias explicitly in DAOD frameworks, providing insights that pave the way for developing more robust and generalizable object detection systems.

Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has emerged as a promising paradigm in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and small memory footprint. However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNN for images through a new coding method that exploits bit plane representation. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the accuracy of SNN without increasing model size. Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN. By leveraging the unique characteristics of bit planes, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.

Abstract: Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations have demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis; further, material-lighting disentanglement on 3DGS warrants relighting capabilities and its adaptability to broader applications. While the general approach to the latter operation lies in integrating differentiable physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to jointly recover BRDF materials and environment lighting, achieving a precise disentanglement remains an inherently difficult task due to the challenge of accurately modeling light transport. Existing approaches typically approximate Gaussian points' normals, which constitute an implicit geometric constraint. However, they usually suffer from inaccuracies in normal estimation that subsequently degrade light transport, resulting in noisy material decomposition and flawed relighting results. To address this, we propose GeoSplatting, a novel approach that augments 3DGS with explicit geometry guidance for precise light transport modeling. By differentiably constructing a surface-grounded 3DGS from an optimizable mesh, our approach leverages well-defined mesh normals and the opaque mesh surface, and additionally facilitates the use of mesh-based ray tracing techniques for efficient, occlusion-aware light transport calculations. This enhancement ensures precise material decomposition while preserving the efficiency and high-quality rendering capabilities of 3DGS. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoSplatting, highlighting its superior efficiency and state-of-the-art inverse rendering performance.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually learn new classes from only a few samples without forgetting previous ones, requiring intelligent agents to adapt to dynamic environments. FSCIL combines the characteristics and challenges of class-incremental learning and few-shot learning: (i) Current classes occupy the entire feature space, which is detrimental to learning new classes. (ii) The small number of samples in incremental rounds is insufficient for fully training. In existing mainstream virtual class methods, for addressing the challenge (i), they attempt to use virtual classes as placeholders. However, new classes may not necessarily align with the virtual classes. For the challenge (ii), they replace trainable fully connected layers with Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifiers based on cosine similarity, but NCM classifiers do not account for sample imbalance issues. To address these issues in previous methods, we propose the class-center guided embedding Space Allocation with Angle-Norm joint classifiers (SAAN) learning framework, which provides balanced space for all classes and leverages norm differences caused by sample imbalance to enhance classification criteria. Specifically, for challenge (i), SAAN divides the feature space into multiple subspaces and allocates a dedicated subspace for each session by guiding samples with the pre-set category centers. For challenge (ii), SAAN establishes a norm distribution for each class and generates angle-norm joint logits. Experiments demonstrate that SAAN can achieve state-of-the-art performance and it can be directly embedded into other SOTA methods as a plug-in, further enhancing their performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal sensor fusion in Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation has become the leading approach for 3D object detection. However, existing methods often rely on depth estimators or transformer encoders to transform image features into BEV space, which reduces robustness or introduces significant computational overhead. Moreover, the insufficient geometric guidance in view transformation results in ray-directional misalignments, limiting the effectiveness of BEV representations. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient View Transformation (EVT), a novel 3D object detection framework that constructs a well-structured BEV representation, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Our approach focuses on two key aspects. First, Adaptive Sampling and Adaptive Projection (ASAP), which utilizes LiDAR guidance to generate 3D sampling points and adaptive kernels, enables more effective transformation of image features into BEV space and a refined BEV representation. Second, an improved query-based detection framework, incorporating group-wise mixed query selection and geometry-aware cross-attention, effectively captures both the common properties and the geometric structure of objects in the transformer decoder. On the nuScenes test set, EVT achieves state-of-the-art performance of 75.3% NDS with real-time inference speed.

Abstract: Visual text rendering are widespread in various real-world applications, requiring careful font selection and typographic choices. Recent progress in diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-image (T2I) models show promise in automating these processes. However, these methods still encounter challenges like inconsistent fonts, style variation, and limited fine-grained control, particularly at the word-level. This paper proposes a two-stage DiT-based pipeline to address these problems by enhancing controllability over typography and style in text rendering. We introduce typography control fine-tuning (TC-FT), an parameter-efficient fine-tuning method (on $5\%$ key parameters) with enclosing typography control tokens (ETC-tokens), which enables precise word-level application of typographic features. To further address style inconsistency in text rendering, we propose a text-agnostic style control adapter (SCA) that prevents content leakage while enhancing style consistency. To implement TC-FT and SCA effectively, we incorporated HTML-render into the data synthesis pipeline and proposed the first word-level controllable dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving superior word-level typographic control, font consistency, and style consistency in text rendering tasks. The datasets and models will be available for academic use.

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. To tackle this challenge, we propose FreeScale, a tuning-free inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation via scale fusion. Specifically, FreeScale processes information from different receptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Notably, compared with previous best-performing methods, FreeScale unlocks the 8k-resolution text-to-image generation for the first time.

Abstract: Point transformers have demonstrated remarkable progress in 3D understanding through expanded receptive fields (RF), but further expanding the RF leads to dilution in group attention and decreases detailed feature extraction capability. Proxy, which serves as abstract representations for simplifying feature maps, enables global RF. However, existing proxy-based approaches face critical limitations: Global proxies incur quadratic complexity for large-scale point clouds and suffer positional ambiguity, while local proxy alternatives struggle with 1) Unreliable sampling from the geometrically diverse point cloud, 2) Inefficient proxy interaction computation, and 3) Imbalanced local-global information fusion; To address these challenges, we propose Sparse Proxy Point Transformer (SP$^{2}$T) -- a local proxy-based dual-stream point transformer with three key innovations: First, for reliable sampling, spatial-wise proxy sampling with vertex-based associations enables robust sampling on geometrically diverse point clouds. Second, for efficient proxy interaction, sparse proxy attention with a table-based relative bias effectively achieves the interaction with efficient map-reduce computation. Third, for local-global information fusion, our dual-stream architecture maintains local-global balance through parallel branches. Comprehensive experiments reveal that SP$^{2}$T sets state-of-the-art results with acceptable latency on indoor and outdoor 3D comprehension benchmarks, demonstrating marked improvement (+3.8% mIoU vs. SPoTr@S3DIS, +22.9% mIoU vs. PointASNL@Sem.KITTI) compared to other proxy-based point cloud methods.

Abstract: Monocular facial performance capture in-the-wild is challenging due to varied capture conditions, face shapes, and expressions. Most current methods rely on linear 3D Morphable Models, which represent facial expressions independently of identity at the vertex displacement level. We propose SEREP (Semantic Expression Representation), a model that disentangles expression from identity at the semantic level. We start by learning an expression representation from high-quality 3D data of unpaired facial expressions. Then, we train a model to predict expression from monocular images relying on a novel semi-supervised scheme using low quality synthetic data. In addition, we introduce MultiREX, a benchmark addressing the lack of evaluation resources for the expression capture task. Our experiments show that SEREP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, capturing challenging expressions and transferring them to new identities.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) represents a critical and challenging subtask within the general VQA domain. Despite significant advancements in general VQA, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still exhibit substantial limitations when handling multi-task VQA scenarios. These limitations manifest through erroneous spatial localization and misinterpretation of medical images, which primarily arise from two fundamental issues: inadequate image-text alignment and insufficient domain-specified knowledge for medical applications. To address these issues, we introduce the Cross-Modal Clinical Knowledge Distiller (ClinKD), an innovative framework designed to enhance image-text alignment and establish more effective medical knowledge transformation mechanisms, which enables MLLMs to perform better even when lacking prior medical knowledge. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the ClinKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets which are challenging for Med-VQA task. The results indicate that our approach not only significantly improves image-text alignment but also effectively enables MLLMs to adapt to the medical knowledge. The source code for ClinKD is available at: https://github.com/overloadedHenry/ClinKD.

Abstract: We present X-Dancer, a novel zero-shot music-driven image animation pipeline that creates diverse and long-range lifelike human dance videos from a single static image. As its core, we introduce a unified transformer-diffusion framework, featuring an autoregressive transformer model that synthesize extended and music-synchronized token sequences for 2D body, head and hands poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human motion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment with musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this, we first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human pose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large articulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained motions (e.g., head and hands). We then design a music-to-motion transformer model that autoregressively generates music-aligned dance pose token sequences, incorporating global attention to both musical style and prior motion context. Finally we leverage a diffusion backbone to animate the reference image with these synthesized pose tokens through AdaIN, forming a fully differentiable end-to-end framework. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Dancer is able to produce both diverse and characterized dance videos, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods in term of diversity, expressiveness and realism. Code and model will be available for research purposes.

Abstract: Human pose estimation is a critical task in computer vision and sports biomechanics, with applications spanning sports science, rehabilitation, and biomechanical research. While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) has effectively scaled up chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) often suffer from diverse and unknown degradations during imaging, leading to severe spectral and spatial distortions. Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MP-HSIR}, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/ZhehuiWu/MP-HSIR.

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing allows effective and interactive editing of videos using only instructions without extra inputs such as masks or attributes. However, collecting high-quality training triplets (source video, edited video, instruction) is a challenging task. Existing datasets mostly consist of low-resolution, short duration, and limited amount of source videos with unsatisfactory editing quality, limiting the performance of trained editing models. In this work, we present a high-quality Instruction-based Video Editing dataset with 1M triplets, namely InsViE-1M. We first curate high-resolution and high-quality source videos and images, then design an effective editing-filtering pipeline to construct high-quality editing triplets for model training. For a source video, we generate multiple edited samples of its first frame with different intensities of classifier-free guidance, which are automatically filtered by GPT-4o with carefully crafted guidelines. The edited first frame is propagated to subsequent frames to produce the edited video, followed by another round of filtering for frame quality and motion evaluation. We also generate and filter a variety of video editing triplets from high-quality images. With the InsViE-1M dataset, we propose a multi-stage learning strategy to train our InsViE model, progressively enhancing its instruction following and editing ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our InsViE-1M dataset and the trained model over state-of-the-art works.

Abstract: Remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion (STF) addresses the fundamental trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution by combining high temporal-low spatial and high spatial-low temporal imagery. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of deep learning advances in remote sensing STF over the past decade. We establish a systematic taxonomy of deep learning architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and sequence models, revealing significant growth in deep learning adoption for STF tasks. Our analysis reveals that CNN-based methods dominate spatial feature extraction, while Transformer architectures show superior performance in capturing long-range temporal dependencies. GAN and diffusion models demonstrate exceptional capability in detail reconstruction, substantially outperforming traditional methods in structural similarity and spectral fidelity. Through comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets comparing ten representative methods, we validate these findings and quantify the performance trade-offs between different approaches. We identify five critical challenges: time-space conflicts, limited generalization across datasets, computational efficiency for large-scale processing, multi-source heterogeneous fusion, and insufficient benchmark diversity. The survey highlights promising opportunities in foundation models, hybrid architectures, and self-supervised learning approaches that could address current limitations and enable multimodal applications. The specific models, datasets, and other information mentioned in this article have been collected in: https://github.com/yc-cui/Deep-Learning-Spatiotemporal-Fusion-Survey.

Abstract: This paper presents MedSegFactory, a versatile medical synthesis framework that generates high-quality paired medical images and segmentation masks across modalities and tasks. It aims to serve as an unlimited data repository, supplying image-mask pairs to enhance existing segmentation tools. The core of MedSegFactory is a dual-stream diffusion model, where one stream synthesizes medical images and the other generates corresponding segmentation masks. To ensure precise alignment between image-mask pairs, we introduce Joint Cross-Attention (JCA), enabling a collaborative denoising paradigm by dynamic cross-conditioning between streams. This bidirectional interaction allows both representations to guide each other's generation, enhancing consistency between generated pairs. MedSegFactory unlocks on-demand generation of paired medical images and segmentation masks through user-defined prompts that specify the target labels, imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and pathological conditions, facilitating scalable and high-quality data generation. This new paradigm of medical image synthesis enables seamless integration into diverse medical imaging workflows, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments show that MedSegFactory generates data of superior quality and usability, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art performance in 2D and 3D segmentation tasks while addressing data scarcity and regulatory constraints.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves photorealistic novel view synthesis, its performance degrades with motion blur. In scenarios with rapid motion or low-light conditions, existing RGB-based deblurring methods struggle to model camera pose and radiance changes during exposure, reducing reconstruction accuracy. Event cameras, capturing continuous brightness changes during exposure, can effectively assist in modeling motion blur and improving reconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting (EBAD-Gaussian), which reconstructs sharp 3D Gaussians from event streams and severely blurred images. This method jointly learns the parameters of these Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time. Specifically, we first construct a blur loss function by synthesizing multiple latent sharp images during the exposure time, minimizing the difference between real and synthesized blurred images. Then we use event stream to supervise the light intensity changes between latent sharp images at any time within the exposure period, supplementing the light intensity dynamic changes lost in RGB images. Furthermore, we optimize the latent sharp images at intermediate exposure times based on the event-based double integral (EDI) prior, applying consistency constraints to enhance the details and texture information of the reconstructed images. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that EBAD-Gaussian can achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction under the condition of blurred images and event stream inputs.

Abstract: Computer vision is transforming fashion industry through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, in contrast, extracts standardized garment images from photos of clothed individuals. We introduce Multi-Garment TryOffDiff (MGT), a diffusion-based VTOFF model capable of handling diverse garment types, including upper-body, lower-body, and dresses. MGT builds on a latent diffusion architecture with SigLIP-based image conditioning to capture garment characteristics such as shape, texture, and pattern. To address garment diversity, MGT incorporates class-specific embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art VTOFF results on VITON-HD and competitive performance on DressCode. When paired with VTON models, it further enhances p2p-VTON by reducing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin tone, ensuring preservation of person-specific characteristics.

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) exhibit promising potential for multi-modal understanding, yet their application to video-based emotion recognition remains limited by insufficient spatial and contextual awareness. Traditional approaches, which prioritize isolated facial features, often neglect critical non-verbal cues such as body language, environmental context, and social interactions, leading to reduced robustness in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Set-of-Vision-Text Prompting (SoVTP), a novel framework that enhances zero-shot emotion recognition by integrating spatial annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, facial landmarks), physiological signals (facial action units), and contextual cues (body posture, scene dynamics, others' emotions) into a unified prompting strategy. SoVTP preserves holistic scene information while enabling fine-grained analysis of facial muscle movements and interpersonal dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SoVTP achieves substantial improvements over existing visual prompting methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing VLLMs' video emotion recognition capabilities.

<title>Sim-to-Real: An Unsupervised Noise Layer for Screen-Camera Watermarking Robustness</title>

Abstract: Unauthorized screen capturing and dissemination pose severe security threats such as data leakage and information theft. Several studies propose robust watermarking methods to track the copyright of Screen-Camera (SC) images, facilitating post-hoc certification against infringement. These techniques typically employ heuristic mathematical modeling or supervised neural network fitting as the noise layer, to enhance watermarking robustness against SC. However, both strategies cannot fundamentally achieve an effective approximation of SC noise. Mathematical simulation suffers from biased approximations due to the incomplete decomposition of the noise and the absence of interdependence among the noise components. Supervised networks require paired data to train the noise-fitting model, and it is difficult for the model to learn all the features of the noise. To address the above issues, we propose Simulation-to-Real (S2R). Specifically, an unsupervised noise layer employs unpaired data to learn the discrepancy between the modeled simulated noise distribution and the real-world SC noise distribution, rather than directly learning the mapping from sharp images to real-world images. Learning this transformation from simulation to reality is inherently simpler, as it primarily involves bridging the gap in noise distributions, instead of the complex task of reconstructing fine-grained image details. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating superior watermark robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) boosts immersive experiences in computer vision and graphics. Existing techniques, though progressed, rely on dense multi-view observations, restricting their application. This work takes on the challenge of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from sparse or single-view inputs. We introduce SpatialCrafter, a framework that leverages the rich knowledge in video diffusion models to generate plausible additional observations, thereby alleviating reconstruction ambiguity. Through a trainable camera encoder and an epipolar attention mechanism for explicit geometric constraints, we achieve precise camera control and 3D consistency, further reinforced by a unified scale estimation strategy to handle scale discrepancies across datasets. Furthermore, by integrating monocular depth priors with semantic features in the video latent space, our framework directly regresses 3D Gaussian primitives and efficiently processes long-sequence features using a hybrid network structure. Extensive experiments show our method enhances sparse view reconstruction and restores the realistic appearance of 3D scenes.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation are often overconfident, compromising both reliability and clinical utility. In this work, we propose differentiable formulations of marginal L1 Average Calibration Error (mL1-ACE) as an auxiliary loss that can be computed on a per-image basis. We compare both hard- and soft-binning approaches to directly improve pixel-wise calibration. Our experiments on four datasets (ACDC, AMOS, KiTS, BraTS) demonstrate that incorporating mL1-ACE significantly reduces calibration errors, particularly Average Calibration Error (ACE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), while largely maintaining high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs). We find that the soft-binned variant yields the greatest improvements in calibration, over the Dice plus cross-entropy loss baseline, but often compromises segmentation performance, with hard-binned mL1-ACE maintaining segmentation performance, albeit with weaker calibration improvement. To gain further insight into calibration performance and its variability across an imaging dataset, we introduce dataset reliability histograms, an aggregation of per-image reliability diagrams. The resulting analysis highlights improved alignment between predicted confidences and true accuracies. Overall, our approach not only enhances the trustworthiness of segmentation predictions but also shows potential for safer integration of deep learning methods into clinical workflows. We share our code here: https://github.com/cai4cai/Average-Calibration-Losses

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night, it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we developed a high-precision visible light reflectance generative model, called Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m}, 0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance generation at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90, with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime generation capability was validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial progress in the ability to generate visible light reflectance at night, with the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Abstract: Vanilla autoregressive image generation models generate visual tokens step-by-step, limiting their ability to capture holistic relationships among token sequences. Moreover, because most visual tokenizers map local image patches into latent tokens, global information is limited. To address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. Hita incorporates two key strategies to better align with the AR generation process: 1) {arranging} a sequential structure with holistic tokens at the beginning, followed by patch-level tokens, and using causal attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) adopting a lightweight fusion module before feeding the de-quantized tokens into the decoder to control information flow and prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID} and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. Detailed analysis of the holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image properties, such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/Hita}{https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/Hita}.

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features, and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised, statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation, thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels. Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method.

Abstract: We propose Electrostatic Field Matching (EFM), a novel method that is suitable for both generative modeling and distribution transfer tasks. Our approach is inspired by the physics of an electrical capacitor. We place source and target distributions on the capacitor plates and assign them positive and negative charges, respectively. We then learn the electrostatic field of the capacitor using a neural network approximator. To map the distributions to each other, we start at one plate of the capacitor and move the samples along the learned electrostatic field lines until they reach the other plate. We theoretically justify that this approach provably yields the distribution transfer. In practice, we demonstrate the performance of our EFM in toy and image data experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a large model-driven framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image semantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information among tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a trend in the field of autonomous driving, promising a data-driven, scalable approach to system design. However, existing E2E-AD methods usually adopt the sequential paradigm of perception-prediction-planning, which leads to cumulative errors and training instability. The manual ordering of tasks also limits the system`s ability to leverage synergies between tasks (for example, planning-aware perception and game-theoretic interactive prediction and planning). Moreover, the dense BEV representation adopted by existing methods brings computational challenges for long-range perception and long-term temporal fusion. To address these challenges, we present DriveTransformer, a simplified E2E-AD framework for the ease of scaling up, characterized by three key features: Task Parallelism (All agent, map, and planning queries direct interact with each other at each block), Sparse Representation (Task queries direct interact with raw sensor features), and Streaming Processing (Task queries are stored and passed as history information). As a result, the new framework is composed of three unified operations: task self-attention, sensor cross-attention, temporal cross-attention, which significantly reduces the complexity of system and leads to better training stability. DriveTransformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated closed-loop benchmark Bench2Drive and real world open-loop benchmark nuScenes with high FPS.

Abstract: This paper introduces the largest and most comprehensive dataset of US presidential campaign television advertisements, available in digital format. The dataset also includes machine-searchable transcripts and high-quality summaries designed to facilitate a variety of academic research. To date, there has been great interest in collecting and analyzing US presidential campaign advertisements, but the need for manual procurement and annotation led many to rely on smaller subsets. We design a large-scale parallelized, AI-based analysis pipeline that automates the laborious process of preparing, transcribing, and summarizing videos. We then apply this methodology to the 9,707 presidential ads from the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive. We conduct extensive human evaluations to show that these transcripts and summaries match the quality of manually generated alternatives. We illustrate the value of this data by including an application that tracks the genesis and evolution of current focal issue areas over seven decades of presidential elections. Our analysis pipeline and codebase also show how to use LLM-based tools to obtain high-quality summaries for other video datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled transformative advancements across diverse applications but remain susceptible to safety threats, especially jailbreak attacks that induce harmful outputs. To systematically evaluate and improve their safety, we organized the Adversarial Testing & Large-model Alignment Safety Grand Challenge (ATLAS) 2025}. This technical report presents findings from the competition, which involved 86 teams testing MLLM vulnerabilities via adversarial image-text attacks in two phases: white-box and black-box evaluations. The competition results highlight ongoing challenges in securing MLLMs and provide valuable guidance for developing stronger defense mechanisms. The challenge establishes new benchmarks for MLLM safety evaluation and lays groundwork for advancing safer multimodal AI systems.

<div> Keywords: deepfake, video detection, temporal inconsistencies, Fourier transform, transformer module

Summary:
This article introduces an advanced deepfake video detection approach that focuses on detecting pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies often missed by traditional detectors. By utilizing a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, the method extracts features sensitive to temporal artifacts, especially in areas with unnatural movements. An attention proposal module is introduced to precisely identify regions containing these artifacts. Furthermore, a joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features to enhance the detection capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

<div> Entity Linking, Multimodal, MMoE, Ambiguity, Semantic Matching
Summary:
The Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model addresses mention ambiguity and dynamic selection of modal content in Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL). It consists of four components: description-aware mention enhancement, multimodal feature extraction, intra-level mixture of experts, and inter-level mixture of experts modules. The description-aware module uses large language models to match WikiData descriptions to mentions. The multimodal feature extraction module obtains textual and visual embeddings for mentions and entities. The intra-level and inter-level mixture of experts modules dynamically select features from relevant information regions. Extensive experiments show MMoE outperforms existing methods. The code for MMoE is available on GitHub at https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base. Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components: (i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention, considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

<div> Keywords: Unsupervised domain adaptation, semantic segmentation, text embeddings, Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss, state-of-the-art performance<br />
Summary:<br />
Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is crucial for generalizing class semantics from a labeled source domain to an unseen target domain. This study introduces a novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss (CoPT) that utilizes domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn domain-invariant features in image segmentation. By employing the LLM Domain Template process, source and target domain descriptions are generated and combined using a frozen CLIP model. Experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the CoPT model achieves state-of-the-art performance in UDA for segmentation tasks. This approach harnesses the domain-agnostic properties of text embeddings to enhance segmentation performance significantly, showcasing the importance of leveraging text data in UDA methodologies. The code for this method is available on GitHub for further exploration and adoption by the research community.<br />

arXiv:2507.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain. UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for segmentation.

<div> Keywords: image generation models, machine unlearning, adversarial framework, multi-modal conditioning, robustness

Summary:
Recent advancements in image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion, have raised ethical concerns regarding the generation of harmful, misleading, or copyright-infringing content. To address these issues, machine unlearning has emerged as a potential solution to selectively remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, the effectiveness of current unlearning techniques in the face of multi-modal adversarial inputs remains largely unexplored. This study introduces Recall, a novel adversarial framework that compromises the robustness of unlearned IGMs by exploiting the multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion models. Through experiments on ten state-of-the-art unlearning methods, Recall demonstrated superior adversarial effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the original textual prompt. These results highlight critical vulnerabilities in existing unlearning mechanisms and emphasize the importance of developing more robust solutions to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However, their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning (MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

Summary: 
This paper explores the issue of hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by examining modality conflicts within input data from different modalities. A dataset called Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) is created to simulate this phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods, including prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, are proposed to address hallucinations caused by modality conflict. Experimental results on the MMMC dataset demonstrate that reinforcement learning is most effective in mitigating hallucinations, while supervised fine-tuning also shows promise. This study highlights the importance of understanding and addressing modality conflict in MLLMs to enhance their robustness in real-world scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and compare it with the oracle approach.

Summary: 
CL-Polyp is a novel polyp segmentation network that utilizes contrastive learning to enhance feature extraction without the need for additional annotations. By contrasting positive and negative sample pairs from polyp images, the encoder can better extract discriminative features.

arXiv:2507.07154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However, these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules: the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA) module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation tasks.

Summary:
This study introduces a novel approach to decoding visual experiences from EEG signals using semantic captions generated by a language model. By aligning EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions and leveraging a transformer-based EEG encoder, the model achieves state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset. The use of contrastive learning enables mapping of brain activity to semantic captions, facilitating interpretable alignment to neurocognitive pathways. The model demonstrates the importance of different semantic levels in extracting perceived image information from EEG signals. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across the scalp, providing insights into cognitive processes. By leveraging structured semantic mediation, this approach showcases the potential for cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG signals. <div>

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes -- generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference, caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Summary:<br />
Despite recent progress in video generative models, existing methods struggle to create long-form videos with consistent character appearances and scene layouts. Multi-subject videos face challenges in preserving character consistency and motion coherence. While some approaches can generate longer videos, issues like frame redundancy and low temporal diversity persist. To address these limitations, researchers have been working on producing long-form videos with multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity detail. By studying 32 papers, key architectural components and training strategies have been identified that consistently deliver these qualities. A comprehensive taxonomy of existing methods has been constructed, categorizing papers by their architectural designs and performance characteristics. <div>

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16 seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16 seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their architectural designs and performance characteristics.

Summary: <br />
The research introduces a novel approach called Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI) for Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID). The method leverages color information as a lightweight, annotation-free solution to mitigate appearance bias in ReID models. By using foreground and background colors, CSCI captures color-related appearance bias while separating it from identity-relevant ReID features. The approach incorporates S2A self-attention to prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature space. The analysis confirms the effectiveness of color as a proxy for clothing attributes when explicit labels are unavailable. Extensive experiments on four CC-ReID datasets show significant improvements in image and video-based ReID accuracy without requiring additional supervision. The findings emphasize the potential of leveraging color as a cost-effective strategy to address appearance bias in CC-ReID. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust, clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach for activity-biometrics, where individuals are identified across various activities. Traditional person identification faces challenges due to identity cues getting mixed with motion dynamics and appearance changes. The proposed multimodal language-guided framework, DisenQ, utilizes structured textual supervision to disentangle biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features. This ensures that identity cues remain independent of appearance and motion variations, reducing misidentifications. The approach is evaluated on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It also shows strong generalization to complex real-world scenarios with competitive performance on a traditional video-based identification benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of the framework.

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies. To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling \textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source (GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual reasoning.

Summary:<br />
Recent developments in instruction-guided image editing emphasize the importance of automated evaluation. Open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face alignment issues, while proprietary models lack transparency and cost efficiency. A new automated dataset creation method, ADIEE, was introduced to train a scoring model for image editing evaluation. A large dataset of over 100K samples was generated, leading to the fine-tuning of a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model to decode a numeric score. The resulting scorer outperforms open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5, achieving higher score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench, and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy on GenAI-Bench and AURORA-Bench. The scorer can function as a reward model for automated best edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, it enhances the MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub by 8.98%. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a 0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench, and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43 (+8.98%).

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on (VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the scalability of the method across diverse product ranges. In this work, we propose a novel method to approximate well-established Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on e-commerce sites. We validate our method using real-world makeup images, demonstrating that our framework outperforms other techniques.

<div> contrastive reinforcement learning, entity connection behavior, grounding accuracy, object persistence, well-structured stories <br />
Summary:
In this study, a contrastive reinforcement learning approach was proposed to improve visual storytelling systems' ability to maintain character and object identity across frames. The model was trained to discriminate between coherent image sequences and unrelated images, with a focus on establishing entity connections across frames. By extending the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples and using Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function, significant improvements were observed in grounding accuracy, object persistence, and well-structured stories. Evaluation results showed an increase in grounding mAP, F1 score, pronoun grounding accuracy, cross-frame character and object persistence, and well-structured stories. These enhancements demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing entity connection behavior and overall storytelling coherence. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.07340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models, struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1 from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story, increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

<div> Generalizable depth completion, PacGDC, data diversity, label-efficient, pseudo geometries <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces PacGDC, a label-efficient technique for generalizable depth completion that enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort. PacGDC leverages insights into object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection to synthesize multiple pseudo geometries for the same visual scene by manipulating scene scales in depth maps. A new data synthesis pipeline uses multiple depth foundation models as scale manipulators to provide varied pseudo depth labels while ensuring projection consistency for generalization. Interpolation, relocation strategies, and unlabeled images further diversify geometries, extending data coverage beyond individual foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate PacGDC's remarkable generalizability across benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under zero-shot and few-shot settings. The code is available at https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC. <div>

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection, allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene. This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Summary:<br />
Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) has made advancements in incorporating implicit radial basis function representations to capture complex anatomical structures. However, current methods lack self-adaptivity, which is essential for accurately representing anatomical variability. This paper introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity: a novel neighborhood correspondence loss and a geodesic correspondence algorithm. These mechanisms allow for high adaptivity while maintaining consistent particle configurations. The approach is evaluated on challenging datasets, showcasing efficacy and scalability. The study provides a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and benchmarks against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and correspondence metrics. <div>

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets, providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and correspondence metrics.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Additionally, a large language model (LLM) is integrated to enable motion transfer to species that have not been previously observed.

arXiv:2507.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment (motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder, allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our proposed model.

arXiv:2507.07395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods, Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

Summary:<br />
EscherNet++ is introduced as a masked fine-tuned diffusion model capable of synthesizing novel views of objects and conducting amodal completion in a zero-shot manner. By employing input-level and feature-level masking, the model offers improved ability to synthesize novel views and integrate with other image-to-mesh models without additional training. It achieves competitive results with a significant reduction in reconstruction time, enabling fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller dataset and batch size, EscherNet++ outperforms existing methods in occluded tasks, improving PSNR and Volume IoU. The model also demonstrates generalization to real-world occluded reconstruction tasks. EscherNet++'s scalable nature makes it a promising approach for efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.07410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings, while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Summary: 
EPIC is a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy that aims to align vision and language modalities more efficiently. By using temporal prompts on intermediate layers and leveraging similarity-based prompt interaction, EPIC reduces computational resource consumption and the number of trainable parameters significantly compared to other fine-tuning strategies. With only about 1% of the foundation model's parameters, EPIC achieves superior performance on the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets and comparable performance on the MM-IMDB dataset. This approach demonstrates the potential to effectively integrate vision and language modalities in large-scale pre-trained multimodal models while minimizing computational costs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.07415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC). Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach, our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work, we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector (GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical reasoning and science problem-solving.

<div> Keyword: ultrasound imaging, segmentation, noise robustness, semantic-aware network, video sequences
Summary: 
Ultrasound imaging is widely used for diagnosis due to its non-invasiveness, but noise can hinder accurate segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. The Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet) is introduced to address this challenge by enhancing noise robustness through mutual semantic awareness between local and global features. The Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module guides feature fusion across adjacent frames, reducing the impact of random noise without pixel-level relationships. The Local-and-Global Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module combines temporal unconditional local features with conditional global features to improve resilience to noise interference. Extensive evaluations show that DSANet outperforms existing methods in segmentation accuracy and achieves higher inference frames per second (FPS) by avoiding pixel-level feature dependencies. <div>

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames, effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation, significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some image-based models.

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of 85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and 90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI, significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose \textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1) Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2) Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to 0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon publication.

<div> Statistical Facial Feature Transformation, Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding, GAN, face recognition, image restoration <br />
Summary:
The article introduces a new GAN-based face image restoration framework designed to improve recognition accuracy in adverse weather conditions. The framework includes two key components: the local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) module, which enhances facial structure and color fidelity, and the Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE) module, which enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under varied weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in facial structure reconstruction and texture distortion suppression compared to existing methods. Both the SFFT and DAFE modules successfully enhance structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration, making the proposed framework a valuable advancement in optimizing face recognition systems for challenging outdoor environments. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models, particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

Summary:
This paper addresses the issue of unauthorized exploitation of personal video data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT) by introducing a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs). By efficiently computing TUEs, the proposed method prevents the learning of deep trackers from using original data structure, ensuring video data-privacy. The inclusion of a temporal contrastive loss further enhances the effectiveness of TUEs by corrupting the learning of existing trackers during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection and exhibits strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g., YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT). However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency, limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Summary: 
Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition maps for road-level route planning and online high-definition maps for lane-level navigation. However, the association between global SD maps and online HD maps is often overlooked, posing challenges in utilizing online HD maps effectively. To address this, the Online Map Association (OMA) benchmark is introduced, providing a dataset of roads and lane paths for evaluating navigation performance. A novel framework, Map Association Transformer, is proposed as a baseline method, incorporating path-aware attention and spatial attention mechanisms to establish geometric and topological correspondences. Overall, OMA enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles by facilitating the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps, bridging the gap between global and local map data. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps, which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer, as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological correspondences.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.07496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks: a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences, we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Summary: 
The paper introduces GGMotion, a novel approach that models human motion by considering group graph dynamics-kinematics networks to better leverage physical dependencies between joints. A radial field is proposed to capture comprehensive spatio-temporal dependencies, improving the model's ability to generate realistic motions in 3D space. Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are utilized to capture joint dependencies at different scales. Equivariant multilayer perceptrons are used for joint position feature updates through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation, enhancing physical plausibility. An auxiliary loss helps supervise motion priors during training. Experimental results on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW emphasize the effectiveness and superiority of GGMotion, especially in short-term motion prediction tasks. The code for this approach is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges. Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks, including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in short-term motion prediction.

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods.

<div> Keywords: trajectory modeling, dense points, implicit deformation fields, spline-based representation, temporal interpolation

Summary:
This study proposes a new approach for trajectory modeling of dense points using spline-based representation. Unlike traditional neural network-based methods, this approach explicitly determines the degrees of freedom based on the number of knots in the spline. By efficiently deriving velocities and preserving spatial coherence and accelerations, the method addresses challenges faced in ill-posed scenarios. Additionally, a novel low-rank time-variant spatial encoding technique is introduced to model knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains. The method demonstrates superior performance in temporal interpolation, fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs. Moreover, it achieves high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction without relying on linear blend skinning or constraints like as-rigid-as-possible techniques. This approach offers a more intuitive and coherent way to model dense point trajectories while improving overall quality and performance in dynamic scene reconstruction. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields, often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs. Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

A modality-aware pruning technique is also introduced to retain experts specialized for the task modalities, making the model efficient for specific tasks. Experimental validation on various remote sensing datasets shows strong performance compared to existing models.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping, wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments. Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models.

<div> Ceiling, Linear Separability, Visual-Language Models, Reasoning Pathways, Alignment <br />
<br />
Summary: This study explores the "linear reasoning bottleneck" in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC) as a measure of their performance. The bottleneck is attributed to failures in the language model's reasoning pathways rather than perception issues, indicating a solvable alignment problem. While activating existing pathways is sufficient for semantic concepts, complex relational reasoning requires adapting core model weights. Postfix tuning reveals dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs, but deeper adaptation is necessary for complex relational tasks. Improving representation quality may cause models to fail on new prompt formats. The findings suggest that robust reasoning in VLMs is achievable through targeted alignment rather than solely focusing on representation learning. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks. This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control, we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs. However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

Summary:
Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS) addresses the challenges of weakly supervised semantic segmentation in low-light environments. By combining Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation (DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2), this framework aligns normal-light and low-light features, denoises images, and integrates depth maps for illumination-invariant geometric priors. The diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation techniques improve feature representations, while the use of depth maps enhances structural feature learning. Experimental results show that DGKD-WLSS achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-light weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks. The released source codes provide a valuable resource for further research and development in this area. <div>
arXiv:2507.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation (DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation, while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

<div> Sentinel-2, flood mapping, SegFormer, DEM, disaster response  
Summary:<br /><br /> This article introduces a hierarchical overlap-tiling aggregation (HOTA) strategy for accurate 3D flood mapping using multispectral Sentinel-2 images. HOTA, combined with SegFormer and a depth estimation module, allows for multi-scale inference without retraining the network. By enforcing constraints based on a digital elevation model (DEM), the approach enhances flood extent and depth estimation. A case study on the Kempsey flood in Australia demonstrates improved accuracy compared to baseline methods, with an IoU increase from 73% to 84%. The resulting 3D surface exhibits a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5m, showcasing the potential of HOTA for rapid disaster response efforts. <div>
arXiv:2507.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the 2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting 3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps suitable for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter, a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view hair transfer.

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically, image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method, called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant margins.

Models exhibit difficulty misalignment with human intuition, dramatic performance cliffs between 2D and 3D tasks, and a tendency to rely on formula derivation over visualization.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition, displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Summary:<br />
ViLU is a new framework for Vision-Language Models that addresses the challenge of uncertainty quantification and failure prediction. It integrates visual and textual embeddings along with an image-conditioned textual representation to contextualize uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional methods, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor using a binary classifier approach, making it loss-agnostic and suitable for post-hoc settings. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ViLU compared to existing methods. The method shows significant gains in failure prediction on standard classification datasets like ImageNet-1k and large-scale image-caption datasets such as CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies confirm the importance of ViLU's architecture and training strategy in achieving reliable uncertainty quantification. The code for ViLU is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations. ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found here: https://github.com/ykrmm/ViLU.

Summary:
The article introduces a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (T-GVC) that bridges low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding. It utilizes semantic-aware sparse motion sampling to reduce bitrate while preserving critical temporal semantic information. By incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints, a training-free latent space guidance mechanism ensures physically plausible motion patterns. Experimental results show that T-GVC outperforms traditional codecs and state-of-the-art video compression methods in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios. The framework also demonstrates more precise motion control compared to existing text-guided methods. Overall, T-GVC introduces a novel approach to generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.

arXiv:2507.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.

Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning often exhibit demographic biases, especially concerning age, impacting fairness and reliability. This study focuses on age-related bias in deep FER models, particularly for the elderly. Findings reveal disparities in recognition performance and attention patterns, particularly for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly individuals. Three bias mitigation strategies are proposed and evaluated: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss. Training models with age-aware strategies on AffectNet dataset with estimated age labels improves recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, especially for error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis shows that these models attend to more relevant facial regions for each age group. This study suggests that age-related bias in FER can be effectively reduced through simple training modifications, emphasizing the importance of promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5% in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network, which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback, coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in medical imaging.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions. While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling. In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER. This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at https://github.com/Cross-Innovation-Lab/AU-DFER.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.

<title>Tree-Mamba: A Tree-Aware Mamba for Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation</title>

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently, Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark (called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency. Code and dataset will be available at https://wyjgr.github.io/Tree-Mamba.html.

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

<title>Compressive Imaging Reconstruction via Tensor Decomposed Multi-Resolution Grid Encoding</title>

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI reconstruction method.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$ convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code is available at https://github.com/shangwei5/M2AENet.

<title>One Object, Multiple Lies: A Benchmark for Cross-task Adversarial Attack on Unified Vision-Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.07709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress, enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS) image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology, echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical applications.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage, at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes'' ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets. Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as shown in Figure 1.

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action triggering for human motion capture in sports.

<title>Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner for efficient Video Temporal Grounding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical, parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST), the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/davidpujol/SDST.

arXiv:2507.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light) mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available after the review process.

<title>Deep Learning based 3D Volume Correlation for Additive Manufacturing Using High-Resolution Industrial X-ray Computed Tomography</title>

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors. Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a 9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods, while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and material.

<title>SCOOTER: A Human Evaluation Framework for Unrestricted Adversarial Examples</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07776</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.07776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans, for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i) simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data (unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling (instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off, (iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models, yields best calibration results overall.

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning. The code and datasets can be found in https://github.com/liziwennba/SUPRISE.

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally, we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms, which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios, involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network. Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead, ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

<title>Synergistic Prompting for Robust Visual Recognition with Missing Modalities</title>

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations: (1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges, we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities, ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting its superior adaptability and reliability.

<title>Patient-specific vs Multi-Patient Vision Transformer for Markerless Tumor Motion Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07811</link>

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS) approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP) model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning 4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However, MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained clinical settings.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

<title>Rethinking Query-based Transformer for Continual Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study, however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector. State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality, high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories, covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the demands of modern manufacturing environments.

<title>MeD-3D: A Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Precise Recurrence Prediction in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07839</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07839</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics, often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data, including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA, and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used. These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling inference even when certain modalities are missing.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16 different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness. The code for THUNDER is publicly available at https://github.com/MICS-Lab/thunder.

<title>Single-Step Latent Diffusion for Underwater Image Restoration</title>

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast, and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models -- which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project website https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/MIRA.

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels, and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a visual odometry task.

<title>Not Only Consistency: Enhance Test-Time Adaptation with Spatio-temporal Inconsistency for Remote Physiological Measurement</title>

arXiv:2507.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature, however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities, overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency, achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of vascular contributions to brain health.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights. Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances, high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource-constrained wearable devices demands inference models that harmonize accuracy with computational efficiency. This paper introduces TinierHAR, an ultra-lightweight deep learning architecture that synergizes residual depthwise separable convolutions, gated recurrent units (GRUs), and temporal aggregation to achieve SOTA efficiency without compromising performance. Evaluated across 14 public HAR datasets, TinierHAR reduces Parameters by 2.7x (vs. TinyHAR) and 43.3x (vs. DeepConvLSTM), and MACs by 6.4x and 58.6x, respectively, while maintaining the averaged F1-scores. Beyond quantitative gains, this work provides the first systematic ablation study dissecting the contributions of spatial-temporal components across proposed TinierHAR, prior SOTA TinyHAR, and the classical DeepConvLSTM, offering actionable insights for designing efficient HAR systems. We finally discussed the findings and suggested principled design guidelines for future efficient HAR. To catalyze edge-HAR research, we open-source all materials in this work for future benchmarking\footnote{https://github.com/zhaxidele/TinierHAR}

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page: https://GeometryForcing.github.io.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available. Our project page is: https://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/

<title>CLIP Won't Learn Object-Attribute Binding from Natural Data and Here is Why</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07985</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.07985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and, as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density, incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect binding.

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

<title>Multigranular Evaluation for Brain Visual Decoding</title>

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework. Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However, challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

<title>Single-pass Adaptive Image Tokenization for Minimum Program Search</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.07995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality. KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more. Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs. out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

<title>MGVQ: Could VQ-VAE Beat VAE? A Generalizable Tokenizer with Multi-group Quantization</title>

arXiv:2507.07997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs. Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly, with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of \NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD image processing tasks.

arXiv:2507.07999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control, TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60% accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR (Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning, enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded reasoning.

<title>Impact of Pretraining Word Co-occurrence on Compositional Generalization in Multimodal Models</title>

arXiv:2507.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However, the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data combinatorially. Our code is available at https://github.com/helenqu/multimodal-pretraining-pmi.

Abstract: Plain X-ray is one of the most common image modalities for clinical diagnosis (e.g. bone fracture, pneumonia, cancer screening, etc.). X-ray image segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems, yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image. To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The trained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research purposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training. Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance across 11 recognition datasets.

Abstract: Modern deep learning implementations for medical imaging usually rely on large labeled datasets. These datasets are often difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns, high costs, and even scarcity of cases. In this paper, a label-efficient strategy is proposed for chest X-ray diagnosis that seeks to reflect real-world hospital scenarios. The experiments use the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset and a pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 model. The model is adapted via partial fine-tuning of its visual encoder and then evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot learning with 1-16 labeled examples per disease class. The tests demonstrate that CLIP's pre-trained vision-language features can be effectively adapted to few-shot medical imaging tasks, achieving over 20\% improvement in mean AUC score as compared to the zero-shot baseline. The key aspect of this work is to attempt to simulate internal hospital workflows, where image archives exist but annotations are sparse. This work evaluates a practical and scalable solution for both common and rare disease diagnosis. Additionally this research is intended for academic and experimental purposes only and has not been peer reviewed yet. All code is found at https://github.com/heet007-code/CLIP-disease-xray.

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in language-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target object described in natural language. Despite these advances, we still lack a clear, language-focused benchmark for testing how well such agents ground the words in their instructions. We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set dataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects described at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine attributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was manually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and semantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a benchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand and act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench allows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes, spatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first thorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also present Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable multi-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small objects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms state-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift, dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework, underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics, and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks, including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and effective approach.

Abstract: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple 3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance. While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Abstract: Capture stages are high-end sources of state-of-the-art recordings for downstream applications in movies, games, and other media. One crucial step in almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our approach.

<title>Balancing the Past and Present: A Coordinated Replay Framework for Federated Class-Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details. We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

<title>TRIX- Trading Adversarial Fairness via Mixed Adversarial Training</title>

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments, building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization. Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack, demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Abstract: Image sensors are integral to a wide range of safety- and security-critical systems, including surveillance infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation. These systems rely on the integrity of visual data to make decisions. In this work, we investigate a novel class of electromagnetic signal injection attacks that target the analog domain of image sensors, allowing adversaries to manipulate raw visual inputs without triggering conventional digital integrity checks. We uncover a previously undocumented attack phenomenon on CMOS image sensors: rainbow-like color artifacts induced in images captured by image sensors through carefully tuned electromagnetic interference. We further evaluate the impact of these attacks on state-of-the-art object detection models, showing that the injected artifacts propagate through the image signal processing pipeline and lead to significant mispredictions. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored vulnerability in the visual perception stack, highlighting the need for more robust defenses against physical-layer attacks in such systems.

<title>Synchronizing Task Behavior: Aligning Multiple Tasks during Test-Time Training</title>

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through the information content of their measurements alone, enabling application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed to automate this process through gradient-based. In this work, we study IDEAL across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage, long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for real-world imaging system design.

<title>Adaptive Attention Residual U-Net for curvilinear structure segmentation in fluorescence microscopy and biomedical images</title>

Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy remains a challenging task, particularly under noisy conditions and in dense filament networks commonly seen in vivo. To address this, we created two original datasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled microtubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely mimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset presents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence intensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning has shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often declines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by integrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms in the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and quantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants, namely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements, particularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures, were largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We further benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and found it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset. Finally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained microtubules as well as to other curvilinear structures. Indeed, it successfully segmented retinal blood vessels and nerves in noisy or low-contrast biomedical images, demonstrating its strong potential for applications in disease diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Curating foundation speech models for edge and IoT settings, where computational resources vary over time, requires dynamic architectures featuring adaptable reduction strategies. One emerging approach is layer dropping ($\mathcal{LD}$) which skips fraction of the layers of a backbone network during inference to reduce the computational load. This allows transforming static models into dynamic ones. However, existing approaches exhibit limitations either in the mode of selecting layers or by significantly modifying the neural architecture. To this end, we propose input-driven $\mathcal{LD}$ that employs the network's input features and a lightweight layer selecting network to determine the optimum combination of processing layers. Extensive experimentation on 4 speech and audio public benchmarks, using two different pre-trained foundation models, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, thoroughly outperforming random dropping and producing on-par (or better) results to early exit.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive, multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks. Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini. These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual reasoning.

Abstract: In material science, image segmentation is of great significance for quantitative analysis of microstructures. Here, we propose a novel Weighted Propagation Convolution Neural Network based on U-Net (WPU-Net) to detect boundary in poly-crystalline microscopic images. We introduce spatial consistency into network to eliminate the defects in raw microscopic image. And we customize adaptive boundary weight for each pixel in each grain, so that it leads the network to preserve grain's geometric and topological characteristics. Moreover, we provide our dataset with the goal of advancing the development of image processing in materials science. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising performance in both of objective and subjective assessment. In boundary detection task, it reduces the error rate by 7\%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Abstract: The correct interpretation of convolutional models is a hard problem for time series data. While saliency methods promise visual validation of predictions for image and language processing, they fall short when applied to time series. These tend to be less intuitive and represent highly diverse data, such as the tool-use time series dataset. Furthermore, saliency methods often generate varied, conflicting explanations, complicating the reliability of these methods. Consequently, a rigorous objective assessment is necessary to establish trust in them. This paper investigates saliency methods on time series data to formulate recommendations for interpreting convolutional models and implements them on the tool-use time series problem. To achieve this, we first employ nine gradient-, propagation-, or perturbation-based post-hoc saliency methods across six varied and complex real-world datasets. Next, we evaluate these methods using five independent metrics to generate recommendations. Subsequently, we implement a case study focusing on tool-use time series using convolutional classification models. Our results validate our recommendations that indicate that none of the saliency methods consistently outperforms others on all metrics, while some are sometimes ahead. Our insights and step-by-step guidelines allow experts to choose suitable saliency methods for a given model and dataset.

Abstract: Despite advances in generic object detection, there remains a performance gap in detecting small objects compared to normal-scale objects. We reveal that conventional object localization methods suffer from gradient instability in small objects due to sharper loss curvature, leading to a convergence challenge. To address the issue, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Gradient Stabilization (UGS), a framework that reformulates object localization as a classification task to stabilize gradients. UGS quantizes continuous labels into interval non-uniform discrete representations. Under a classification-based objective, the localization branch generates bounded and confidence-driven gradients, mitigating instability. Furthermore, UGS integrates an uncertainty minimization (UM) loss that reduces prediction variance and an uncertainty-guided refinement (UR) module that identifies and refines high-uncertainty regions via perturbations. Evaluated on four benchmarks, UGS consistently improves anchor-based, anchor-free, and leading small object detectors. Especially, UGS enhances DINO-5scale by 2.6 AP on VisDrone, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Segmentation refinement aims to enhance the initial coarse masks generated by segmentation algorithms. The refined masks are expected to capture more details and better contours of the target objects. Research on segmentation refinement has developed as a response to the need for high-quality image segmentations. However, to our knowledge, no method has been developed that can determine the success of segmentation refinement. Such a method could ensure the reliability of segmentation in applications where the outcome of the segmentation is important and fosters innovation in image processing technologies. To address this research gap, we propose Judging From Support-set (JFS), a method to judge the success of segmentation refinement leveraging an off-the-shelf few-shot segmentation (FSS) model. The traditional goal of the problem in FSS is to find a target object in a query image utilizing target information given by a support set. However, we propose a novel application of the FSS model in our evaluation pipeline for segmentation refinement methods. Given a coarse mask as input, segmentation refinement methods produce a refined mask; these two masks become new support masks for the FSS model. The existing support mask then serves as the test set for the FSS model to evaluate the quality of the refined segmentation by the segmentation refinement methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed JFS framework by evaluating the SAM Enhanced Pseudo-Labels (SEPL) using SegGPT as the choice of FSS model on the PASCAL dataset. The results showed that JFS has the potential to determine whether the segmentation refinement process is successful.

Abstract: In order to unlock the potential of diverse sensors, we investigate a method to transfer knowledge between time-series modalities using a multimodal \textit{temporal} representation space for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Specifically, we explore the setting where the modality used in testing has no labeled data during training, which we refer to as Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA). We categorize existing UMA approaches as Student-Teacher or Contrastive Alignment methods. These methods typically compress continuous-time data samples into single latent vectors during alignment, inhibiting their ability to transfer temporal information through real-world temporal distortions. To address this, we introduce Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T), which preserves temporal information during alignment to handle dynamic sensor data better. C3T achieves this by aligning a set of temporal latent vectors across sensing modalities. Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets demonstrate that C3T outperforms existing methods in UMA by at least 8% in accuracy and shows superior robustness to temporal distortions such as time-shift, misalignment, and dilation. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for various multimodal applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, a comprehensive, large-scale multimodal dataset for medicine, covering over 25 million images across 10 modalities with multigranular annotations for more than 65 diseases. These multigranular annotations encompass both global information, such as modality and organ detection, and local information like ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. Unlike the existing multimodal datasets, which are limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and textual annotations in the form of image-ROI-description triplets without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 30 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular textual descriptions. Compared to existing datasets, MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations, supporting a comprehensive range of multimodal tasks such as captioning and report generation, as well as vision-centric tasks like classification and segmentation. We propose LLaVA-Tri by pretraining LLaVA on MedTrinity-25M, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA, surpassing representative SOTA multimodal large language models. Furthermore, MedTrinity-25M can also be utilized to support large-scale pre-training of multimodal medical AI models, contributing to the development of future foundation models in the medical domain. We will make our dataset available.

Abstract: In this work, we survey recent studies on masked image modeling (MIM), an approach that emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning technique in computer vision. The MIM task involves masking some information, e.g. pixels, patches, or even latent representations, and training a model, usually an autoencoder, to predicting the missing information by using the context available in the visible part of the input. We identify and formalize two categories of approaches on how to implement MIM as a pretext task, one based on reconstruction and one based on contrastive learning. Then, we construct a taxonomy and review the most prominent papers in recent years. We complement the manually constructed taxonomy with a dendrogram obtained by applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We further identify relevant clusters via manually inspecting the resulting dendrogram. Our review also includes datasets that are commonly used in MIM research. We aggregate the performance results of various masked image modeling methods on the most popular datasets, to facilitate the comparison of competing methods. Finally, we identify research gaps and propose several interesting directions of future work. We supplement our survey with the following public repository containing organized references: https://github.com/vladhondru25/MIM-Survey.

Abstract: Aerial object detection plays a crucial role in numerous applications. However, most existing methods focus on detecting predefined object categories, limiting their applicability in real-world open scenarios. In this paper, we extend aerial object detection to open scenarios through image-text collaboration and propose RT-OVAD, the first real-time open-vocabulary detector for aerial scenes. Specifically, we first introduce an image-to-text alignment loss to replace the conventional category regression loss, thereby eliminating category constraints. Next, we propose a lightweight image-text collaboration strategy comprising an image-text collaboration encoder and a text-guided decoder. The encoder simultaneously enhances visual features and refines textual embeddings, while the decoder guides object queries to focus on class-relevant image features. This design further improves detection accuracy without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RT-OVAD consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across open-vocabulary, zero-shot, and traditional closed-set detection tasks. For instance, on the open-vocabulary aerial detection benchmarks DIOR, DOTA-v2.0, and LAE-80C, RT-OVAD achieves 87.7 AP$_{50}$, 53.8 mAP, and 23.7 mAP, respectively, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (LAE-DINO) by 2.2, 7.0, and 3.5 points. In addition, RT-OVAD achieves an inference speed of 34 FPS on an RTX 4090 GPU, approximately three times faster than LAE-DINO (10 FPS), meeting the real-time detection requirements of diverse applications. The code will be released at https://github.com/GT-Wei/RT-OVAD.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to equip AI models with the ability to learn a sequence of tasks over time, without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, have achieved notable success in computer vision. Building on the strengths of SSMs, this study explores leveraging the Mamba model for CL. Therefore, we introduce Mamba-CL, a framework that continuously fine-tunes the core SSMs of the large-scale Mamba foundation model by updating parameters orthogonal to the feature subspace of previous tasks. This approach theoretically guarantees the consistency objective aiming to preserves consistent output for each SSM module across both previous and current tasks, so as to overcome catastrophic forgetting issue. Specifically, we achieve this goal by deducing the overall consistency constraints on four key time-invariant parameters in the Mamba model, streamlining its recurrent state-space structure and non-linear discretization process in SSM. In practice, we apply the null-space projection to efficiently implement the orthogonality within Mamba model. Extensive experiments on four class-incremental benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-CL for anti-forgetting, achieving superior performances to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) demands robust integration of text detection, recognition, and spatial reasoning to interpret complex document layouts. In this work, we introduce DLaVA, a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for zero-shot answer localization in order to improve trustworthiness, interpretability, and explainability. By leveraging an innovative OCR-free approach that organizes text regions with unique bounding box IDs, the proposed method preserves spatial contexts without relying on iterative OCR or chain-of-thought reasoning, thus substantially reducing the computational complexity. We further enhance the evaluation protocol by integrating Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics alongside Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS), thereby ensuring that not only textual accuracy is considered, but spatial accuracy is taken into account, ultimately reducing the risks of AI hallucinations and improving trustworthiness. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, with significantly lower computational complexity and enhanced accuracies and reliability for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Physical AI needs to be trained digitally first. It needs a digital twin of itself, the policy model, and a digital twin of the world, the world model. In this paper, we present the Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform to help developers build customized world models for their Physical AI setups. We position a world foundation model as a general-purpose world model that can be fine-tuned into customized world models for downstream applications. Our platform covers a video curation pipeline, pre-trained world foundation models, examples of post-training of pre-trained world foundation models, and video tokenizers. To help Physical AI builders solve the most critical problems of our society, we make Cosmos open-source and our models open-weight with permissive licenses available via https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict1.

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems can be solved in an unsupervised manner using pre-trained diffusion models, but doing so requires approximating the gradient of the measurement-conditional score function in the diffusion reverse process. We show that the approximations produced by existing methods are relatively poor, especially early in the reverse process, and so we propose a new approach that iteratively reestimates and "renoises" the estimate several times per diffusion step. This iterative approach, which we call Fast Iterative REnoising (FIRE), injects colored noise that is shaped to ensure that the pre-trained diffusion model always sees white noise, in accordance with how it was trained. We then embed FIRE into the DDIM reverse process and show that the resulting "DDfire" offers state-of-the-art accuracy and runtime on several linear inverse problems, as well as phase retrieval.

Abstract: We study reconstructing and predicting 3D fluid appearance and velocity from a single video. Current methods require multi-view videos for fluid reconstruction. We present FluidNexus, a novel framework that bridges video generation and physics simulation to tackle this task. Our key insight is to synthesize multiple novel-view videos as references for reconstruction. FluidNexus consists of two key components: (1) a novel-view video synthesizer that combines frame-wise view synthesis with video diffusion refinement for generating realistic videos, and (2) a physics-integrated particle representation coupling differentiable simulation and rendering to simultaneously facilitate 3D fluid reconstruction and prediction. To evaluate our approach, we collect two new real-world fluid datasets featuring textured backgrounds and object interactions. Our method enables dynamic novel view synthesis, future prediction, and interaction simulation from a single fluid video. Project website: https://yuegao.me/FluidNexus.

<title>GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YvanYin/GoalFlow.

Abstract: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes without labeled training examples by leveraging class-level semantic descriptors such as attributes. A fundamental challenge in ZSL is semantic misalignment, where semantic-unrelated information involved in visual features introduce ambiguity to visual-semantic interaction. Unlike existing methods that suppress semantic-unrelated information post hoc either in the feature space or the model space, we propose addressing this issue at the input stage, preventing semantic-unrelated patches from propagating through the network. To this end, we introduce Semantically contextualized VIsual Patches (SVIP) for ZSL, a transformer-based framework designed to enhance visual-semantic alignment. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised patch selection mechanism that preemptively learns to identify semantic-unrelated patches in the input space. This is trained with the supervision from aggregated attention scores across all transformer layers, which estimate each patch's semantic score. As removing semantic-unrelated patches from the input sequence may disrupt object structure, we replace them with learnable patch embeddings. With initialization from word embeddings, we can ensure they remain semantically meaningful throughout feature extraction. Extensive experiments on ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that SVIP achieves state-of-the-art performance results while providing more interpretable and semantically rich feature representations. Code is available at https://github.com/uqzhichen/SVIP.

Abstract: Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an essential component in the sustainable reconstruction and revitalization of ageing structures. However, model creation usually relies on laborious manual transformation of the unstructured point cloud data provided by laser scans or photogrammetry. This paper presents Cloud2BIM, an open-source software tool designed to automate the conversion of point clouds into BIM models compliant with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. Cloud2BIM integrates advanced algorithms for wall and slab segmentation, opening detection, and room zoning based on real wall surfaces, resulting in a comprehensive and fully automated workflow. Unlike existing tools, it avoids computationally- and calibration-intensive techniques such as RANSAC, supports non-orthogonal geometries, and provides unprecedented processing speed-achieving results up to seven times faster than fastest competing solutions. Systematic validation using benchmark datasets confirms that Cloud2BIM is an easy-to-use, efficient, and scalable solution for generating accurate BIM models, capable of converting extensive point cloud datasets for entire buildings into IFC format with minimal user input.

<title>Localized Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using Training-Free Gated Low-Rank Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning based concept erasing has demonstrated promising results in preventing generation of harmful contents from text-to-image diffusion models by removing target concepts while preserving remaining concepts. To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.

<title>EEPNet-V2: Patch-to-Pixel Solution for Efficient Cross-Modal Registration between LiDAR Point Cloud and Camera Image</title>

Abstract: The primary requirement for cross-modal data fusion is the precise alignment of data from different sensors. However, the calibration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is typically time-consuming and needs external calibration board or specific environmental features. Cross-modal registration effectively solves this problem by aligning the data directly without requiring external calibration. However, due to the domain gap between the point cloud and the image, existing methods rarely achieve satisfactory registration accuracy while maintaining real-time performance. To address this issue, we propose a framework that projects point clouds into several 2D representations for matching with camera images, which not only leverages the geometric characteristic of LiDAR point clouds effectively but also bridge the domain gap between the point cloud and image. Moreover, to tackle the challenges of cross modal differences and the limited overlap between LiDAR point clouds and images in the image matching task, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction network to effectively extract features from both camera images and the projection maps of LiDAR point cloud. Additionally, we propose a patch-to-pixel matching network to provide more effective supervision and achieve high accuracy. We validate the performance of our model through experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the the proposed method achieves real-time performance and extremely high registration accuracy. Specifically, on the KITTI dataset, our model achieves a registration accuracy rate of over 99\%. Our code is released at: https://github.com/ESRSchao/EEPNet-V2.

Abstract: Combining reconstruction models with generative models has emerged as a promising paradigm for closed-loop simulation in autonomous driving. For example, ReconDreamer has demonstrated remarkable success in rendering large-scale maneuvers. However, a significant gap remains between the generated data and real-world sensor observations, particularly in terms of fidelity for structured elements, such as the ground surface. To address these challenges, we propose ReconDreamer++, an enhanced framework that significantly improves the overall rendering quality by mitigating the domain gap and refining the representation of the ground surface. Specifically, ReconDreamer++ introduces the Novel Trajectory Deformable Network (NTDNet), which leverages learnable spatial deformation mechanisms to bridge the domain gap between synthesized novel views and original sensor observations. Moreover, for structured elements such as the ground surface, we preserve geometric prior knowledge in 3D Gaussians, and the optimization process focuses on refining appearance attributes while preserving the underlying geometric structure. Experimental evaluations conducted on multiple datasets (Waymo, nuScenes, PandaSet, and EUVS) confirm the superior performance of ReconDreamer++. Specifically, on Waymo, ReconDreamer++ achieves performance comparable to Street Gaussians for the original trajectory while significantly outperforming ReconDreamer on novel trajectories. In particular, it achieves substantial improvements, including a 6.1% increase in NTA-IoU, a 23. 0% improvement in FID, and a remarkable 4.5% gain in the ground surface metric NTL-IoU, highlighting its effectiveness in accurately reconstructing structured elements such as the road surface.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generative models span a wide range of 3D human actions but struggle with nuanced stylistic attributes such as a "Chicken" style. Due to the scarcity of style-specific data, existing approaches pull the generative prior towards a reference style, which often results in out-of-distribution low quality generations. In this work, we introduce LoRA-MDM, a lightweight framework for motion stylization that generalizes to complex actions while maintaining editability. Our key insight is that adapting the generative prior to include the style, while preserving its overall distribution, is more effective than modifying each individual motion during generation. Building on this idea, LoRA-MDM learns to adapt the prior to include the reference style using only a few samples. The style can then be used in the context of different textual prompts for generation. The low-rank adaptation shifts the motion manifold in a semantically meaningful way, enabling realistic style infusion even for actions not present in the reference samples. Moreover, preserving the distribution structure enables advanced operations such as style blending and motion editing. We compare LoRA-MDM to state-of-the-art stylized motion generation methods and demonstrate a favorable balance between text fidelity and style consistency.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/zongzhao23/STAR-R1.

Abstract: Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence, encompassing 3D reconstruction, perception, and reasoning, is fundamental to applications such as robotics, aerial imaging, and extended reality. A key enabler is the real-time, accurate estimation of core 3D attributes (camera parameters, point clouds, depth maps, and 3D point tracks) from unstructured or streaming imagery. Inspired by the success of large foundation models in language and 2D vision, a new class of end-to-end 3D geometric foundation models (GFMs) has emerged, directly predicting dense 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass, eliminating the need for slow or unavailable precomputed camera parameters. Since late 2023, the field has exploded with diverse variants, but systematic evaluation is lacking. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for 3D GFMs, covering five core tasks: sparse-view depth estimation, video depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, novel view synthesis, and spanning both standard and challenging out-of-distribution datasets. Our standardized toolkit automates dataset handling, evaluation protocols, and metric computation to ensure fair, reproducible comparisons. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art GFMs, revealing their strengths and limitations across tasks and domains, and derive key insights to guide future model scaling and optimization. All code, evaluation scripts, and processed data will be publicly released to accelerate research in 3D spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel- and patch-level representations, but extending it to videos remains challenging due to the complexity of motion dynamics. Existing approaches struggle as they rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main

Abstract: Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal. Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost. Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and has been publicly released.

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches by both normalizing channels activations and applying Hadamard transforms to effectively mitigate outliers and enable aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

Abstract: We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

<title>Are Vision Transformer Representations Semantically Meaningful? A Case Study in Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example, unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over 60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges to the robustness of modern deep neural networks in computer vision, and defending these networks against adversarial attacks has attracted intense research efforts. Among various defense strategies, preprocessing-based defenses are practically appealing since there is no need to train the network under protection. However, such approaches typically do not achieve comparable robustness as other methods such as adversarial training. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for preprocessing-based defenses, where a vector quantizer is used as a preprocessor. This framework, inspired by and extended from Randomized Discretization (RandDisc), is theoretically principled by rate-distortion theory: indeed, RandDisc may be viewed as a scalar quantizer, and rate-distortion theory suggests that such quantization schemes are inferior to vector quantization. In our framework, the preprocessing vector quantizer treats the input image as a collection of patches and finds a set of representative patches based on the patch distributions; each original patch is then modified according to the representative patches close to it. We present two lightweight defenses in this framework, referred to as patched RandDisc (pRD) and sliding-window RandDisc (swRD), where the patches are disjoint in the former and overlapping in the latter. We show that vector-quantization-based defenses have certifiable robust accuracy and that pRD and swRD demonstrate state-of-the-art performances, surpassing RandDisc by a large margin. Notably, the proposed defenses possess the obfuscated gradients property. Our experiments however show that pRD and swRD remain effective under the STE and EOT attacks, which are designed specifically for defenses with gradient obfuscation. ...

<title>OVOR: OnePrompt with Virtual Outlier Regularization for Rehearsal-Free Class-Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent works have shown that by using large pre-trained models along with learnable prompts, rehearsal-free methods for class-incremental learning (CIL) settings can achieve superior performance to prominent rehearsal-based ones. Rehearsal-free CIL methods struggle with distinguishing classes from different tasks, as those are not trained together. In this work we propose a regularization method based on virtual outliers to tighten decision boundaries of the classifier, such that confusion of classes among different tasks is mitigated. Recent prompt-based methods often require a pool of task-specific prompts, in order to prevent overwriting knowledge of previous tasks with that of the new task, leading to extra computation in querying and composing an appropriate prompt from the pool. This additional cost can be eliminated, without sacrificing accuracy, as we reveal in the paper. We illustrate that a simplified prompt-based method can achieve results comparable to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods equipped with a prompt pool, using much less learnable parameters and lower inference cost. Our regularization method has demonstrated its compatibility with different prompt-based methods, boosting those previous SOTA rehearsal-free CIL methods' accuracy on the ImageNet-R and CIFAR-100 benchmarks.

Abstract: In modern imaging systems that computationally process raw measurements before or instead of human viewing, information content matters more than visual appearance. However, developing information estimators that can handle the complexity of real-world measurements yet remain practical enough for widespread use has proven challenging. We introduce a data-driven approach for estimating mutual information between unknown objects and their noisy measurements. Our technique fits probabilistic models to measurements and their noise processes, quantifying information content without requiring ground truth data or making assumptions about object structure. We validate our approach across diverse applications-color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and microscopy-demonstrating that information estimates reliably predict system performance. Finally, we introduce Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL), which optimizes imaging systems to maximize information capture. Our work unlocks information theory as a powerful, practical tool for analyzing and designing imaging systems across a broad range of applications.

Abstract: Multi-modal generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry. Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful diagnostic tool for assessing cardiac structure and function. However, traditional breath-held imaging protocols pose challenges for patients with arrhythmias or limited breath-holding capacity. This work aims to overcome these limitations by developing a reconstruction framework that enables high-quality imaging in free-breathing conditions for various dynamic cardiac MRI protocols. Multi-Dynamic Deep Image Prior (M-DIP), a novel unsupervised reconstruction framework for accelerated real-time cardiac MRI, is introduced. To capture contrast or content variation, M-DIP first employs a spatial dictionary to synthesize a time-dependent intermediate image. Then, this intermediate image is further refined using time-dependent deformation fields that model cardiac and respiratory motion. Unlike prior DIP-based methods, M-DIP simultaneously captures physiological motion and frame-to-frame content variations, making it applicable to a wide range of dynamic applications. We validate M-DIP using simulated MRXCAT cine phantom data as well as free-breathing real-time cine, single-shot late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and first-pass perfusion data from clinical patients. Comparative analyses against state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches demonstrate M-DIP's performance and versatility. M-DIP achieved better image quality metrics on phantom data, higher reader scores on in-vivo cine and LGE data, and comparable scores on in-vivo perfusion data relative to another DIP-based approach. M-DIP enables high-quality reconstructions of real-time free-breathing cardiac MRI without requiring external training data. Its ability to model physiological motion and content variations makes it a promising approach for various dynamic imaging applications.

<title>Diffusion Augmented Retrieval: A Training-Free Approach to Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Interactive Text-to-image retrieval (I-TIR) is an important enabler for a wide range of state-of-the-art services in domains such as e-commerce and education. However, current methods rely on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which are costly to train and update, and exhibit poor generalizability. This latter issue is of particular concern, as: 1) finetuning narrows the pretrained distribution of MLLMs, thereby reducing generalizability; and 2) I-TIR introduces increasing query diversity and complexity. As a result, I-TIR solutions are highly likely to encounter queries and images not well represented in any training dataset. To address this, we propose leveraging Diffusion Models (DMs) for text-to-image mapping, to avoid finetuning MLLMs while preserving robust performance on complex queries. Specifically, we introduce Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a framework that generates multiple intermediate representations via LLM-based dialogue refinements and DMs, producing a richer depiction of the user's information needs. This augmented representation facilitates more accurate identification of semantically and visually related images. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that for simple queries, DAR achieves results on par with finetuned I-TIR models, yet without incurring their tuning overhead. Moreover, as queries become more complex through additional conversational turns, DAR surpasses finetuned I-TIR models by up to 7.61% in Hits@10 after ten turns, illustrating its improved generalization for more intricate queries.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction(HOI) is the fundamental link between human and environment, yet its dexterous and complex pose significantly challenges for gesture control. Despite significant advances in AI and robotics, enabling machines to understand and simulate hand-object interactions, capturing the semantics of functional grasping tasks remains a considerable challenge. While previous work can generate stable and correct 3D grasps, they are still far from achieving functional grasps due to unconsidered grasp semantics. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative two-stage framework, Functional Grasp Synthesis Net (FGS-Net), for generating 3D HOI driven by functional text. This framework consists of a text-guided 3D model generator, Functional Grasp Generator (FGG), and a pose optimization strategy, Functional Grasp Refiner (FGR). FGG generates 3D models of hands and objects based on text input, while FGR fine-tunes the poses using Object Pose Approximator and energy functions to ensure the relative position between the hand and object aligns with human intent and remains physically plausible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves precise and high-quality HOI generation without requiring additional 3D annotation data.

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models effectively increase the number of parameters while maintaining consistent computational costs per token. However, vanilla MoE models often suffer from limited diversity and specialization among experts, constraining their performance and scalability, especially as the number of experts increases. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on vanilla MoE with top-$k$ routing inspired by sparse representation. This allows us to bridge established theoretical insights from sparse representation into MoE models. Building on this foundation, we propose a group sparse regularization approach for the input of top-$k$ routing, termed Mixture of Group Experts (MoGE). MoGE indirectly regularizes experts by imposing structural constraints on the routing inputs, while preserving the original MoE architecture. Furthermore, we organize the routing input into a 2D topographic map, spatially grouping neighboring elements. This structure enables MoGE to capture representations invariant to minor transformations, thereby significantly enhancing expert diversity and specialization. Comprehensive evaluations across various Transformer models for image classification and language modeling tasks demonstrate that MoGE substantially outperforms its MoE counterpart, with minimal additional memory and computation overhead. Our approach provides a simple yet effective solution to scale the number of experts and reduce redundancy among them. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be publicly released.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained increasing attention in time series research, driving interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models for time series analysis. As the field moves toward multi-modality, Large Vision Models (LVMs) are emerging as a promising direction. In the past, the effectiveness of Transformer and LLMs in time series has been debated. When it comes to LVMs, a similar question arises: are LVMs truely useful for time series analysis? To address it, we design and conduct the first principled study involving 4 LVMs, 8 imaging methods, 18 datasets and 26 baselines across both high-level (classification) and low-level (forecasting) tasks, with extensive ablation analysis. Our findings indicate LVMs are indeed useful for time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. Although effective, the contemporary best LVM forecasters are limited to specific types of LVMs and imaging methods, exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods, and have limited ability to utilize long look-back windows. We hope our findings could serve as a cornerstone for future research on LVM- and multimodal-based solutions to different time series tasks.

Abstract: Medical image data is less accessible than in other domains due to privacy and regulatory constraints. In addition, labeling requires costly, time-intensive manual image annotation by clinical experts. To overcome these challenges, synthetic medical data generation offers a promising solution. Generative AI (GenAI), employing generative deep learning models, has proven effective at producing realistic synthetic images. This study proposes a novel mask-guided GenAI approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic fetal head ultrasound images paired with segmentation masks. These synthetic pairs augment real datasets for supervised fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our results show that the synthetic data captures real image features effectively, and this approach reaches state-of-the-art fetal head segmentation, especially when trained with a limited number of real image-mask pairs. In particular, the segmentation reaches Dice Scores of 94.66\% and 94.38\% using a handful of ultrasound images from the Spanish and African cohorts, respectively. Our code, models, and data are available on GitHub.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach using patient-specific digital twins to assess the accuracy of deformable image registration (DIR) methods for highly mobile gastrointestinal (GI) organs. Through a semi-automated pipeline, 21 motion phases were simulated from static 3D patient scans, enabling the evaluation of six DIR methods. The pipeline successfully synthesized digital twins modeling realistic GI motion, achieving motion amplitudes and Jacobian determinant values comparable to real-patient data. Detailed quantitative metrics were extracted for DIR performance assessment, including target registration error and Dice similarity coefficient. Additionally, the pipeline allowed for the evaluation of dose warping accuracy, enabling rigorous testing of DIR tools in dynamic and anatomically complex regions. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for assessing spatial and dosimetric accuracies in GI organs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR) requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins (DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets, including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars, and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and dosimetric accuracies.

<br />Summary:
The study introduces LongAnimation, a framework for automated long animation colorization based on a dynamic global-local paradigm. It addresses the limitations of existing studies by incorporating global color-consistent features through the SketchDiT and Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM) modules. The DGLM module dynamically compresses historical global features and fuses them with current generation features to maintain long-term color consistency. A Color Consistency Reward is introduced to refine color consistency, and a color consistency fusion technique is proposed for smooth video segment transitions during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining both short-term and long-term color consistency in open-domain animation colorization tasks. The code for LongAnimation is available at the provided link. <div>

Abstract: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color consistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

Summary:
Our proposed method for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) leverages a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss module and curriculum contrastive regularization to address the limitations of existing deep learning-based UIE methods. By incorporating a CLIP perception model into the enhancement network, we enhance the perceptual quality of underwater images by aligning with human visual perception. The CLIP perception model also helps improve the constraints imposed on enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space, preventing both under-enhancement and over-enhancement. Additionally, by categorizing the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process, we ensure comprehensive utilization of distorted images and negatives with varied quality levels. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of visual quality and generalization ability, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space. Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space, mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement. Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process, ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and generalization ability.

<div> SPARC, Sparse Autoencoders, Unified Latent Space, Concept Alignment, Cross-Model Interpretability
Summary:
SPARC introduces a new framework called Sparse Autoencoders for Aligned Representation of Concepts (SPARC) that learns a unified latent space shared across diverse AI architectures and modalities. It enforces alignment through Global TopK sparsity mechanism and Cross-Reconstruction Loss, improving concept alignment significantly. With a Jaccard similarity of 0.80 on Open Images, SPARC enables direct comparison of how different architectures represent the same concepts. The shared sparse latent space created by SPARC allows for practical applications such as text-guided spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal retrieval. The code and models for SPARC are available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts, such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single, unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g., vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism, ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal retrieval.

<div> Keywords: uncertainty quantification, neural implicit 3D representations, Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), BayesSDF, geometric consistency 

Summary: 
BayesSDF introduces a novel probabilistic framework for quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D models using Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). Unlike existing methods, BayesSDF addresses computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and geometric inconsistencies by leveraging a Laplace approximation to estimate local surface instability through Hessian-based metrics. This approach allows for computationally efficient and surface-aware uncertainty estimation, resulting in better calibration and geometric consistency compared to radiance-based models. The method demonstrates close correspondence between uncertainty predictions and poorly reconstructed geometry, enabling actionable confidence measures for downstream applications. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets show that BayesSDF outperforms existing methods, providing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction, simulation, and robotic decision-making.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry, providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency, establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction, simulation, and robotic decision-making.

- Large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges in accurate segmentation and comprehension due to weak visual comprehension and lack of fine-grained perception. 
- The proposed LIRA framework addresses these limitations by incorporating a Semantic-Enhanced Feature Extractor (SEFE) for improved object attribute inference and an Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) for local description generation based on segmentation masks.

The LIRA framework proposes solutions by incorporating a Semantic-Enhanced Feature Extractor (SEFE) for better object attribute inference and an Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) for fine-grained supervision based on segmentation masks. The relationship between object segmentation precision and latent semantics is explored using the Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset.

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations: inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2) Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks, offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with the latent related semantics of the  token. To quantify this relationship and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces the Centralized Copy-Paste Data Augmentation (CCPDA) method to enhance the training of deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, focusing on improving segmentation outcomes for the fire class. CCPDA involves identifying fire clusters in source images, centralizing the core of the fire area, and pasting refined fire clusters onto target images. This method increases dataset diversity while maintaining the essential characteristics of the fire class. Numerical analysis and comparison with other augmentation techniques validate the effectiveness of CCPDA in enhancing fire-class segmentation performance, particularly when dealing with small, manually labeled training datasets. The approach showcases improved segmentation metrics specific to the fire class, highlighting its operational significance in the domain of wildland fire science. <div>

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i) identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel, ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2 operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world environments with diverse corruptions.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction. Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation, soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of simulation-driven augmentation and modular training for impedance-based HAR.

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments. We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS datasets, respectively.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces THOR, a real-time adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that utilizes thermal sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. By using low-resolution thermal camera data, the method identifies transitions between hand-related activities and adjusts the RGB frame sampling rate accordingly. Thermal cues are used to localize the region of interest in each RGB frame, allowing for processing only the necessary part of the image for activity recognition. Through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and evaluation on a large dataset, the method demonstrates capturing all activity segments using just 3% of the original RGB video data, achieving a high F1-score for hand-related activity recognition. This approach offers a practical solution for monitoring hand-related activities and health-risk behaviors in real-time using wearable cameras. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However, continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30 activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9 countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3% of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments, and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and health-risk behaviors in real time.

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation. Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency, and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$ fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi 4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8 FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance, making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge computing.

arXiv:2507.06485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations, making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2% improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong reasoning performance.

<div> Keywords: 6D object pose estimation, monocular RGB images, cluttered scenes, Mask6D, pre-training<br />
Summary: <br />
The article addresses the challenge of robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using monocular RGB images. The proposed approach, named Mask6D, involves pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and visible mask maps to enhance feature extraction and eliminate background interference. By incorporating these additional modal information with RGB images in a pre-training strategy, the model is better equipped to handle challenging scenarios. A specially designed object-focused pre-training loss function further improves the network's ability to predict accurate poses. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned using a conventional pose training strategy to ensure reliable pose prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing end-to-end pose estimation methods. <div>
arXiv:2507.06486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous end-to-end pose estimation methods.

<div> Keywords: Open vocabulary HOI detection, Vision-Language Models, Bilateral Collaboration framework, Attention Bias Guidance, Large Language Model-based Supervision Guidance 

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel framework, BC-HOI, for open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. This framework incorporates an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG) component that directs Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate fine-grained interaction features at the instance level. It also includes a Supervision Guidance component based on Large Language Models (LLM), which provides token-level supervision for the HOI detector. Through the collaboration of ABG and LSG, high-quality attention bias is generated, enhancing the performance of the system. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show superior performance in both open vocabulary and closed settings. The code for this framework will be made available on Github.

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging task that detects all  triplets of interest in an image, even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations. However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained, which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG) component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The code will be released in Github.

Summary:
Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have shown great progress in tasks involving video and text, but often face issues with generating content that does not align with the visual input, known as hallucinations. Current evaluation methods are limited to specific tasks and struggle to assess hallucinations accurately in free-form responses. To bridge this gap, the authors introduce FIFA, a comprehensive evaluation framework that focuses on faithfulness. This framework extracts detailed facts, models their semantic dependencies through a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and validates them using VideoQA models. Additionally, the authors propose Post-Correction, a tool-based correction framework to address hallucinated content. Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that FIFA better aligns with human judgment compared to existing evaluation methods and that Post-Correction significantly enhances factual consistency in both text and video generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in both text and video generation.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU) method is introduced to address security risks associated with Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs). These models, like Stable Diffusion, are popular for generating realistic images based on text but can pose dangers if misused. Current concept unlearning techniques struggle to balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability. KSCU capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling characteristic of diffusion models by focusing on pivotal steps with the most influence on the final image outcome. By fine-tuning the model at these key steps for different concept unlearning tasks, KSCU reduces parameter updates required for effective unlearning and maximizes retention of generative capabilities. Benchmark experiments show that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs from producing undesirable images while maintaining model generative capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion, which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU) method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally, KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL) gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923. To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D sign language animation.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces ILNet, a trajectory prediction method that incorporates Inverse Learning (IL) attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module to enhance model performance in multi-agent interaction scenarios. ILNet models interactions at neighboring moments using IL Attention to capture complex spatio-temporal coordination patterns. The DAS module extracts multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors without increasing parameters significantly. Experimental results on INTERACTION and Argoverse datasets demonstrate that ILNet outperforms existing methods, especially in challenging interaction scenarios, offering higher accuracy and diverse trajectory predictions with fewer parameters. The proposed model adapts human-like driving behaviors by dynamically adjusting predictions based on surrounding agents' intentions, improving overall trajectory prediction accuracy in complex environments. The code for ILNet is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination, capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL) attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments, introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over fewer parameters.

<div> active learning, smart data selection, wildlife monitoring, animal detection, camera traps

Summary:<br />
- Smart data selection is crucial in data-driven machine learning, and active learning can optimize the use of labeled data by selecting the most informative samples.
- Camera trap wildlife data is abundant, making data labeling and model training challenging, but active learning can assist in automating wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts.
- Existing active learning techniques typically require full access to a machine learning model, limiting their applicability.
- A model-agnostic active learning approach for animal detection in camera trap images is proposed in this paper, incorporating uncertainty and diversity measures at both object and image levels.
- Experimental results on a benchmark animal dataset show that with only 30% of the training data selected by the proposed approach, a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve performance comparable to or better than using the complete training dataset.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart data selection is becoming increasingly important in data-driven machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach, a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

<div> Token Bottleneck, self-supervised learning, sequential scene understanding, visual tracking, robotic manipulation 

Summary:
Token Bottleneck (ToBo) is a self-supervised learning approach for generating compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic scenes. It encodes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. This facilitates sequential scene understanding by encoding the reference scene conservatively and capturing temporal dynamics during prediction. ToBo outperforms baselines in various sequential tasks like video label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments. The model's robustness and effectiveness are confirmed in real-world settings with physical robots. Additionally, ToBo's scalability across different model scales is validated. Overall, ToBo improves sequential scene representation learning and enables better understanding of dynamic transitions across scenes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across different model scales.

Concept-TRAK introduces concept-level attribution for diffusion models in image generation, addressing copyright and transparency concerns. It enhances influence functions with a reformulated training loss based on diffusion posterior sampling for robust attribution. A concept-aware reward function prioritizes semantic relevance, improving attribution accuracy. Evaluation on the AbC benchmark demonstrates significant enhancements compared to existing methods. Case studies highlight applications in identifying IP-protected and unsafe content, analyzing prompt engineering, and fostering responsible generative AI development. Concept-level attribution offers actionable insights for model governance and development, contributing to ethical AI practices. <div>
arXiv:2507.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency. Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called \emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new divergence-based similarity function (DSF) for leveraging multiple augmented views in contrastive learning. DSF captures the joint structure of augmented views by representing them as distributions and measuring similarity as the divergence between these distributions. Experimental results show that DSF improves performance in kNN classification and linear evaluation tasks. It also offers greater efficiency compared to other multi-view methods. A theoretical connection between DSF and cosine similarity is established, highlighting that DSF does not require a temperature hyperparameter like cosine similarity. This work presents a novel approach to effectively incorporating multiple views in contrastive learning, showcasing the potential benefits of capturing the joint structure across augmented views. <div>
arXiv:2507.06560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF) that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

<div> Edge detection, WBCE loss, EBT loss, tri-class formulation, structured learning <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces the Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss as a novel approach for edge detection in computer vision. The EBT loss divides pixels into edge, boundary, and texture categories, assigning distinct weights to each for more precise predictions. It improves on the widely used Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss by providing structured learning that focuses on edge precision and contextual boundary localization. The EBT loss is shown to generalize the WBCE loss theoretically, with superior performance demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks. The EBT loss also requires minimal fine-tuning and is easily deployable in practice, with consistent use of hyperparameters across all models and datasets. This new approach has the potential to advance the field of edge detection by addressing the limitations of current methods. <br />  <div>
arXiv:2507.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning and is easily deployable in practice.

MOST is a new motion diffusion model that aims to generate human motion from rare language prompts effectively.

The retrieval stage quantifies textual-motion coherence at the clip level, improving matching accuracy. In the generation stage, a motion prompt module generates semantically consistent movements using retrieved motion clips. Extensive evaluations show that MOST achieves top performance in text-to-motion retrieval and generation, especially for rare prompts. This model's effectiveness is demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative results. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct, fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy. In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

<div> Keywords: adaptive margin contrastive learning, 3D semantic segmentation, point clouds, ambiguity estimation, robustness

Summary:
This paper introduces an adaptive margin contrastive learning approach for 3D semantic segmentation on point clouds. The method takes into account the ambiguity levels of individual points, allowing for adaptive objectives during training. By incorporating contrastive learning into an ambiguity estimation framework, the model can better handle ambiguous points, ensuring correct labels for low-ambiguity points while allowing for mistakes in high-ambiguity points. The proposed AMContrast3D method promotes model training that enhances segmentation performance and robustness. Additionally, the AMContrast3D++ approach further enhances the model by incorporating a novel ambiguity prediction module that improves the reliability of ambiguous embeddings. Experimental results on indoor scene datasets S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving accurate 3D semantic segmentation. The code for the method is available on GitHub. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training, which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness. Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/YangChenApril/AMContrast3D.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video reconstruction to address flickering caused by exposure fluctuations in reference images. The DCS consists of one camera capturing consistent reference sequences and another capturing non-reference sequences for supplementation. An exposure-adaptive fusion network (EAFNet) is proposed to enhance robustness in handling video data. EAFNet incorporates a pre-alignment subnetwork to explore exposure influences, an asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork for feature fusion, and a reconstruction subnetwork with a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce artifacts.

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue, we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation. To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork, which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

Summary: 
Cross-Modal Dual-Causal Learning (CMDCL) is proposed for long-term action recognition, addressing challenges in complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. The model introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal relationships between videos and label texts. By addressing cross-modal biases in text embeddings through textual causal intervention and removing visual confounders through visual causal intervention guided by debiased text, CMDCL enables robust action representations. Experimental results on benchmarks Charades, Breakfast, and COIN demonstrate the model's effectiveness. The code for CMDCL is available on GitHub for further research and development.

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning (CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

Summary: 
The article introduces a spatial-spectral omni-fusion network called Omni-Fuse for hyperspectral image segmentation. It addresses the challenges of high dimensionality and spectral redundancy in Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI). The Omni-Fuse model incorporates cross-dimensional feature fusion operations such as a cross-dimensional enhancement module, spectral-guided spatial query selection, and a two-stage cross-dimensional decoder. Despite its numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains efficient during execution.

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation, named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent improvement in DSC.

<div> Keywords: view-dependent projection, point cloud segmentation, 3D-to-2D mapping, color regularization, semantic understanding

Summary:
The paper introduces view-dependent projection (VDP) for efficient point cloud segmentation by dynamically adapting 3D-to-2D mapping to varying spatial geometry. Existing methods use view-independent projection with pre-defined parameters, limiting point awareness and projection diversity. VDP generates data-driven projections from 3D point distributions, inspired by fireworks' adaptive behavior, yielding informative single-image inputs. Color regularization optimizes the framework's efficiency by emphasizing essential features and suppressing non-semantic ones. The PointVDP approach offers lightweight projections with minimal computational costs. Experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance, providing a resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions. However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition, we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

By leveraging slide-level supervision, the model surpasses the limitations of SSL methods and achieves remarkable data efficiency without compromising performance. This innovation highlights the potential of direct slide-level supervision in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of biomarker prediction in digital pathology.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks. However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Summary:
Learning from sparse labels in the medical domain, particularly for dense pixel-level annotations, is challenging due to factors like annotation cost. This study addresses the task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in 2D carcinosis detection in laparoscopic videos for ovarian cancer diagnostic planning. By formulating the problem as sparse heatmap regression, the researchers introduce a novel loss function, the Crag and Tail loss, which effectively utilizes positive sparse labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives.

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain. This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed, this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized, can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations. Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints, highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense annotations are challenging to obtain.

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts. However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average 36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

Summary:  
Diff$^2$I2P proposes a novel approach for image-to-point cloud registration by using a diffusion prior to bridge the modality gap. The Control-Side Score Distillation technique is used to optimize transformation predictions by distilling knowledge from a diffusion model. The Deformable Correspondence Tuning module enables differentiable estimation of correspondences and transformation. By leveraging the diffusion model as a strong prior, Diff$^2$I2P improves cross-modal feature learning and achieves superior registration performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with over 7% improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework, leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap. Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7% improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However, the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application, which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP) to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/NEC-N-SOGI/msdpp.

Summary:
Diffusion models have been successful in image restoration by utilizing strong priors, often within a Bayesian framework. However, the interactions between denoising and likelihood guidance steps have not been thoroughly explored, leading to instabilities in the generative process. Conflicts between prior and likelihood gradients and fluctuations in the likelihood gradient hinder restoration performance. To address these issues, Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD) is proposed. SPGD incorporates a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to alleviate gradient conflicts and adaptive directional momentum smoothing to reduce gradient fluctuations. Extensive experiments across various restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD enhances generation stability, yielding top-notch performance in quantitative metrics and visually improved results. The code for SPGD is available at the provided GitHub repository.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages. However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.

FlexGaussian eliminates the need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets. Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness. Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability for zero-shot class-agnostic counting.

<div> Keywords: spatial-temporal graph, music-guided dance video synthesis, skeleton sequences, self-supervised regularization network, dataset.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel spatial-temporal graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) for music-guided dance video synthesis. It aims to translate music into a dance video through two translation mappings: music-to-skeleton and skeleton-to-video. The spatial-temporal graph Mamba (STGM) block is proposed for constructing skeleton sequences from the input music effectively. A self-supervised regularization network is introduced for translating generated skeletons along with a conditional image into a dance video. A new dataset containing 54,944 video clips for skeleton-to-video translation is collected from the Internet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STG-Mamba outperforms existing methods, achieving significantly better results in music-guided dance video synthesis.<br />

Abstract: We propose a novel spatial-temporal graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) for the music-guided dance video synthesis task, i.e., to translate the input music to a dance video. STG-Mamba consists of two translation mappings: music-to-skeleton translation and skeleton-to-video translation. In the music-to-skeleton translation, we introduce a novel spatial-temporal graph Mamba (STGM) block to effectively construct skeleton sequences from the input music, capturing dependencies between joints in both the spatial and temporal dimensions. For the skeleton-to-video translation, we propose a novel self-supervised regularization network to translate the generated skeletons, along with a conditional image, into a dance video. Lastly, we collect a new skeleton-to-video translation dataset from the Internet, containing 54,944 video clips. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STG-Mamba achieves significantly better results than existing methods.

Summary:
SpatialReasoner is a novel framework for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding that enhances spatial reasoning using large language models. It fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations in language queries and incorporates visual properties in constructing a hierarchical feature field for 3D scenes. The framework uses distilled CLIP features and masks from the Segment Anything Model to represent language and instance features. By querying this hierarchical feature field, SpatialReasoner can accurately localize target 3D instances based on spatial relations in language queries. Extensive experiments show that SpatialReasoner outperforms baseline models in 3D visual grounding while improving spatial reasoning capabilities. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.

Summary:
Our research focuses on improving Sign Language Translation (SLT) by introducing a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure of sign language. We leverage pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language alignment to enhance translation quality. By hierarchically extracting features at frame, segment, and video levels and aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence, our approach improves BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency. This method addresses the disparity between visual and textual representations in SLT, bridging the gap between gloss-based and gloss-free approaches. By incorporating structured linguistic information and leveraging the power of Large Language Models, we aim to enhance the translation accuracy and flexibility of SLT methods. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving SLT performance.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning. Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios without synthetic data or memory banks.

<div> Image fusion, Residual Prior Module, Frequency Domain Fusion Module, Cross Promotion Module, auxiliary decoder, saliency structure loss<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel Residual Prior-driven Frequency-aware Network (RPFNet) for image fusion, aiming to enhance high-level vision tasks by integrating complementary information from different modalities. RPFNet utilizes a dual-branch feature extraction framework with the Residual Prior Module extracting modality-specific differences and the Frequency Domain Fusion Module enabling efficient global feature modeling through frequency-domain convolution. The Cross Promotion Module further enhances feature interaction for improved fusion. During training, auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss are employed to enhance sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss are combined to constrain the solution space and capture local details and global features while retaining complementary information. Extensive experiments validate RPFNet's fusion performance, showcasing enhanced texture details, salient object preservation, and effective facilitation of high-level vision tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM) extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module (FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM) enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information. Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the high-level vision task.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains, ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset (CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation. Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988. This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive future research in industrial AI.

<div> adaptive reuse, prompt-derived semantic cues, input-output relationship modeling, classifier-free guidance, dynamic mechanism
Summary:
The paper introduces Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated from input prompts. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues, PCA allows for more adaptive and informed reuse decisions, improving output quality. The study also addresses limitations of TeaCache by enhancing input-output relationship modeling through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. DynCFGCache is proposed as a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free guidance outputs based on estimated output variations, leading to flexible reuse without compromising quality. Extensive experiments show significant acceleration, such as a 2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model, while maintaining high visual fidelity across various scenes. <div>
arXiv:2507.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues, PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example, 2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across a range of scenes.

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity. Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

Abstract: Manchu, a critically endangered language essential for understanding early modern Eastern Eurasian history, lacks effective OCR systems that can handle real-world historical documents. This study develops high-performing OCR systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data, while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes technical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and linguists to process historical archives without specialized computing resources.

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9 MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of 92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally, FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs better in real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However, the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the importance of replicating aerial viewing angles.

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However, conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods. Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic, audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image, predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts. Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+ (HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+ leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions, ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions, our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

<title>Know Your Attention Maps: Class-specific Token Masking for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple [CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote [CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

<title>IAP: Invisible Adversarial Patch Attack through Perceptibility-Aware Localization and Perturbation Optimization</title>

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes. Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

Abstract: This study presents findings from long-term biometric evaluations conducted at the Biometric Evaluation Center (bez). Over the course of two and a half years, our ongoing research with over 400 participants representing diverse ethnicities, genders, and age groups were regularly assessed using a variety of biometric tools and techniques at the controlled testing facilities. Our findings are based on the General Data Protection Regulation-compliant local bez database with more than 238.000 biometric data sets categorized into multiple biometric modalities such as face and finger. We used state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms to analyze long-term comparison scores. Our results show that these scores fluctuate more significantly between individual days than over the entire measurement period. These findings highlight the importance of testing biometric characteristics of the same individuals over a longer period of time in a controlled measurement environment and lays the groundwork for future advancements in biometric data analysis.

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

<title>Adaptive Part Learning for Fine-Grained Generalized Category Discovery: A Plug-and-Play Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation, which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements on fine-grained datasets.

<title>MCCD: A Multi-Attribute Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset Annotated with Script Styles, Dynasties, and Calligraphers</title>

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles, dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value. However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce, and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765 categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types), dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks, including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in multiple fields. The dataset is available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/MCCD.

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765 km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale. Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences, eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

<title>Segmentation Regularized Training for Multi-Domain Deep Learning Registration applied to MR-Guided Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy</title>

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART. Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV, performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95 >= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

<title>Hallucinating 360{\deg}: Panoramic Street-View Generation via Local Scenes Diffusion and Probabilistic Prompting</title>

arXiv:2507.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e., no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

Abstract: Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population declines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine learning research.

<title>Free on the Fly: Enhancing Flexibility in Test-Time Adaptation with Online EM</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data. Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution settings.

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception, which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for cooperative vehicles.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions. Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process. Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in radiology report generation.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting 3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for prognostic models in this context.

<title>Learning Deliberately, Acting Intuitively: Unlocking Test-Time Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs</title>

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However, multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained histology images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict cellular composition directly from H&amp;E-stained histology images by leveraging information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches: distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations, we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module, independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks.

<title>Evaluating Large Multimodal Models for Nutrition Analysis: A Benchmark Enriched with Contextual Metadata</title>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored. Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories, macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs (four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought, Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona. Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs for improved nutrition analysis.

<title>An AI Approach for Learning the Spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07073</link>

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However, our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e., when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized (leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion generation. The code is available at https://github.com/VankouF/MotionMillion-Codes.

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models (image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure under $1,000 USD.

arXiv:2507.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at 256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery, fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g., NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at: https://4kagent.github.io.

<title>Towards Multimodal Understanding via Stable Diffusion as a Task-Aware Feature Extractor</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding, particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional reasoning.

Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms is inherently related to the extraction of meaningful features, as they play a pivotal role in the performance of these algorithms. Central to this challenge is the quality of data representation. However, the ability to generalize and extract these features effectively from unseen datasets is also crucial. In light of this, we introduce a novel concept: the polyrepresentation. Polyrepresentation integrates multiple representations of the same modality extracted from distinct sources, for example, vector embeddings from the Siamese Network, self-supervised models, and interpretable radiomic features. This approach yields better performance metrics compared to relying on a single representation. Additionally, in the context of X-ray images, we demonstrate the transferability of the created polyrepresentation to a smaller dataset, underscoring its potential as a pragmatic and resource-efficient approach in various image-related solutions. It is worth noting that the concept of polyprepresentation on the example of medical data can also be applied to other domains, showcasing its versatility and broad potential impact.

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical image segmentation. However, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba state-space model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through sparse, adaptive expert routing. The first stage employs a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer to partition input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second stage aggregates these outputs via a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design, combining local expert routing with global expert refinement improves generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art results across datasets from the three most commonly used 3D medical imaging modalities and data quality.

Abstract: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of synaptic weights. This work introduces WINGs (Automatic Weight Generator for Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models), a novel framework that dynamically generates layer weights in a fully connected neural network (FC) and compresses the weights in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during inference, significantly reducing memory requirements without sacrificing accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss. This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge applications.

<title>Mitigating Multi-Sequence 3D Prostate MRI Data Scarcity through Domain Adaptation using Locally-Trained Latent Diffusion Models for Prostate Cancer Detection</title>

arXiv:2507.06384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) could mitigate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical image interpretation. The recent CCELLA LDM improved prostate cancer detection performance using synthetic MRI for classifier training but was limited to the axial T2-weighted (AxT2) sequence, did not investigate inter-institutional domain shift, and prioritized radiology over histopathology outcomes. We propose CCELLA++ to address these limitations and improve clinical utility. Methods: CCELLA++ expands CCELLA for simultaneous biparametric prostate MRI (bpMRI) generation, including the AxT2, high b-value diffusion series (HighB) and apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). Domain adaptation was investigated by pretraining classifiers on real or LDM-generated synthetic data from an internal institution, followed with fine-tuning on progressively smaller fractions of an out-of-distribution, external dataset. Results: CCELLA++ improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC but not AxT2 (0.013, 0.012, 0.063 respectively) sequences compared to CCELLA (0.060). Classifier pretraining with CCELLA++ bpMRI outperformed real bpMRI in AP and AUC for all domain adaptation scenarios. CCELLA++ pretraining achieved highest classifier performance below 50% (n=665) external dataset volume. Conclusion: Synthetic bpMRI generated by our method can improve downstream classifier generalization and performance beyond real bpMRI or CCELLA-generated AxT2-only images. Future work should seek to quantify medical image sample quality, balance multi-sequence LDM training, and condition the LDM with additional information. Significance: The proposed CCELLA++ LDM can generate synthetic bpMRI that outperforms real data for domain adaptation with a limited target institution dataset.

Abstract: Evaluating and comparing the performance of autonomous Humanoid Robots is challenging, as success rate metrics are difficult to reproduce and fail to capture the complexity of robot movement trajectories, critical in Human-Robot Interaction and Collaboration (HRIC). To address these challenges, we propose a general evaluation framework that measures the quality of Imitation Learning (IL) methods by focusing on trajectory performance. We devise the Neural Meta Evaluator (NeME), a deep learning model trained to classify actions from robot joint trajectories. NeME serves as a meta-evaluator to compare the performance of robot control policies, enabling policy evaluation without requiring human involvement in the loop. We validate our framework on ergoCub, a humanoid robot, using teleoperation data and comparing IL methods tailored to the available platform. The experimental results indicate that our method is more aligned with the success rate obtained on the robot than baselines, offering a reproducible, systematic, and insightful means for comparing the performance of multimodal imitation learning approaches in complex HRI tasks.

Abstract: Breast density assessment is a crucial component of mammographic interpretation, with high breast density (BI-RADS categories C and D) representing both a significant risk factor for developing breast cancer and a technical challenge for tumor detection. This study proposes an automated deep learning system for robust binary classification of breast density (low: A/B vs. high: C/D) using the VinDr-Mammo dataset. We implemented and compared four advanced convolutional neural networks: ResNet18, ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121, each enhanced with channel attention mechanisms. To address the inherent class imbalance, we developed a novel Combined Focal Label Smoothing Loss function that integrates focal loss, label smoothing, and class-balanced weighting. Our preprocessing pipeline incorporated advanced techniques, including contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) and comprehensive data augmentation. The individual models were combined through an optimized ensemble voting approach, achieving superior performance (AUC: 0.963, F1-score: 0.952) compared to any single model. This system demonstrates significant potential to standardize density assessments in clinical practice, potentially improving screening efficiency and early cancer detection rates while reducing inter-observer variability among radiologists.

Abstract: This study conducts a comprehensive comparison of four neural network architectures: Convolutional Neural Network, Capsule Network, Convolutional Kolmogorov--Arnold Network, and the newly proposed Capsule--Convolutional Kolmogorov--Arnold Network. The proposed Capsule-ConvKAN architecture combines the dynamic routing and spatial hierarchy capabilities of Capsule Network with the flexible and interpretable function approximation of Convolutional Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks. This novel hybrid model was developed to improve feature representation and classification accuracy, particularly in challenging real-world biomedical image data. The architectures were evaluated on a histopathological image dataset, where Capsule-ConvKAN achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of 91.21\%. The results demonstrate the potential of the newly introduced Capsule-ConvKAN in capturing spatial patterns, managing complex features, and addressing the limitations of traditional convolutional models in medical image classification.

Abstract: While pathology foundation models have transformed cancer image analysis, they often lack integration with molecular data at single-cell resolution, limiting their utility for precision oncology. Here, we present PAST, a pan-cancer single-cell foundation model trained on 20 million paired histopathology images and single-cell transcriptomes spanning multiple tumor types and tissue contexts. By jointly encoding cellular morphology and gene expression, PAST learns unified cross-modal representations that capture both spatial and molecular heterogeneity at the cellular level. This approach enables accurate prediction of single-cell gene expression, virtual molecular staining, and multimodal survival analysis directly from routine pathology slides. Across diverse cancers and downstream tasks, PAST consistently exceeds the performance of existing approaches, demonstrating robust generalizability and scalability. Our work establishes a new paradigm for pathology foundation models, providing a versatile tool for high-resolution spatial omics, mechanistic discovery, and precision cancer research.

Abstract: Despite large-scale pretraining endowing models with language and vision reasoning capabilities, improving their spatial reasoning capability remains challenging due to the lack of data grounded in the 3D world. While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.

<title>Airway Segmentation Network for Enhanced Tubular Feature Extraction</title>

Abstract: Manual annotation of airway regions in computed tomography images is a time-consuming and expertise-dependent task. Automatic airway segmentation is therefore a prerequisite for enabling rapid bronchoscopic navigation and the clinical deployment of bronchoscopic robotic systems. Although convolutional neural network methods have gained considerable attention in airway segmentation, the unique tree-like structure of airways poses challenges for conventional and deformable convolutions, which often fail to focus on fine airway structures, leading to missed segments and discontinuities. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel tubular feature extraction network, named TfeNet. TfeNet introduces a novel direction-aware convolution operation that first applies spatial rotation transformations to adjust the sampling positions of linear convolution kernels. The deformed kernels are then represented as line segments or polylines in 3D space. Furthermore, a tubular feature fusion module (TFFM) is designed based on asymmetric convolution and residual connection strategies, enhancing the network's focus on subtle airway structures. Extensive experiments conducted on one public dataset and two datasets used in airway segmentation challenges demonstrate that the proposed TfeNet achieves more accuracy and continuous airway structure predictions compared with existing methods. In particular, TfeNet achieves the highest overall score of 94.95% on the current largest airway segmentation dataset, Airway Tree Modeling(ATM22), and demonstrates advanced performance on the lung fibrosis dataset(AIIB23). The code is available at https://github.com/QibiaoWu/TfeNet.

<title>Denoising Multi-Beta VAE: Representation Learning for Disentanglement and Generation</title>

Abstract: Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher $\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then, introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions. Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images, functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$, facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

Abstract: Object navigation in open-world environments remains a formidable and pervasive challenge for robotic systems, particularly when it comes to executing long-horizon tasks that require both open-world object detection and high-level task planning. Traditional methods often struggle to integrate these components effectively, and this limits their capability to deal with complex, long-range navigation missions. In this paper, we propose LOVON, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for hierarchical task planning with open-vocabulary visual detection models, tailored for effective long-range object navigation in dynamic, unstructured environments. To tackle real-world challenges including visual jittering, blind zones, and temporary target loss, we design dedicated solutions such as Laplacian Variance Filtering for visual stabilization. We also develop a functional execution logic for the robot that guarantees LOVON's capabilities in autonomous navigation, task adaptation, and robust task completion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the successful completion of long-sequence tasks involving real-time detection, search, and navigation toward open-vocabulary dynamic targets. Furthermore, real-world experiments across different legged robots (Unitree Go2, B2, and H1-2) showcase the compatibility and appealing plug-and-play feature of LOVON.

Abstract: We propose Fast Equivariant Imaging (FEI), a novel unsupervised learning framework to efficiently train deep imaging networks without ground-truth data. From the perspective of reformulating the Equivariant Imaging based optimization problem via the method of Lagrange multipliers and utilizing plug-and-play denoisers, this novel unsupervised scheme shows superior efficiency and performance compared to vanilla Equivariant Imaging paradigm. In particular, our PnP-FEI scheme achieves an order-of-magnitude (10x) acceleration over standard EI on training U-Net with CT100 dataset for X-ray CT reconstruction, with improved generalization performance.

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead, US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales, while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness, Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and adaptability to images from unseen domains. \textit{Code and datasets will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Many real-world classification problems, such as plant identification, have extremely long-tailed class distributions. In order for prediction sets to be useful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional coverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the prediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify candidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when applied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice between small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good class-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods with guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and class-conditional coverage. First, we propose a conformal score function, prevalence-adjusted softmax, that targets a relaxed notion of class-conditional coverage called macro-coverage. Second, we propose a label-weighted conformal prediction method that allows us to interpolate between marginal and class-conditional conformal prediction. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet and iNaturalist, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes, respectively.

Abstract: Accurate cortical surface reconstruction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is crucial for reliable neuroanatomical analyses. Current methods have to contend with complex cortical geometries, strict topological requirements, and often produce surfaces with overlaps, self-intersections, and topological defects. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce SimCortex, a deep learning framework that simultaneously reconstructs all brain surfaces (left/right white-matter and pial) from T1-weighted(T1w) MRI volumes while preserving topological properties. Our method first segments the T1w image into a nine-class tissue label map. From these segmentations, we generate subject-specific, collision-free initial surface meshes. These surfaces serve as precise initializations for subsequent multiscale diffeomorphic deformations. Employing stationary velocity fields (SVFs) integrated via scaling-and-squaring, our approach ensures smooth, topology-preserving transformations with significantly reduced surface collisions and self-intersections. Evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate that SimCortex dramatically reduces surface overlaps and self-intersections, surpassing current methods while maintaining state-of-the-art geometric accuracy.

<title>A Principled Framework for Multi-View Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL), a leading paradigm in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), typically relies on pairs of data views generated through augmentation. While multiple augmentations per instance (more than two) improve generalization in supervised learning, current CL methods handle additional views suboptimally by simply aggregating different pairwise objectives. This approach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple optimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it fails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits fundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL losses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view multiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations through two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to incorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data point, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views while scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches are theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for alignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to multi-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three other datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing multi-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity. We also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to other contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most significantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views effectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding space, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning.

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper, we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter" navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications from urban exploration to emergency response.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that enhances non-rigid 3D model deformations by bridging mesh representations with 3D Gaussian splatting. While traditional Gaussian splatting delivers fast, real-time radiance-field rendering, its post-editing capabilities and support for large-scale, non-rigid deformations remain limited. Our method addresses these challenges by embedding Gaussian kernels directly onto explicit mesh surfaces. This allows the mesh's inherent topological and geometric priors to guide intuitive editing operations -- such as moving, scaling, and rotating individual 3D components -- and enables complex deformations like bending and stretching. This work paves the way for more flexible 3D content-creation workflows in applications spanning virtual reality, character animation, and interactive design.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in the automated detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images. However, achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a challenge. In this research, we propose Deep Brain Net, a novel deep learning system designed to optimize performance in the detection of brain tumors. The model integrates the strengths of two advanced neural network architectures which are EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50, combined with transfer learning to improve generalization and reduce training time. The EfficientNetB0 architecture enhances model efficiency by utilizing mobile inverted bottleneck blocks, which incorporate depth wise separable convolutions. This design significantly reduces the number of parameters and computational cost while preserving the ability of models to learn complex feature representations. The ResNet50 architecture, pre trained on large scale datasets like ImageNet, is fine tuned for brain tumor classification. Its use of residual connections allows for training deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and avoiding performance degradation. The integration of these components ensures that the proposed system is both computationally efficient and highly accurate. Extensive experiments performed on publicly available MRI datasets demonstrate that Deep Brain Net consistently outperforms existing state of the art methods in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency. The result is an accuracy of 88 percent, a weighted F1 score of 88.75 percent, and a macro AUC ROC score of 98.17 percent which demonstrates the robustness and clinical potential of Deep Brain Net in assisting radiologists with brain tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance, as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts (DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance. Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Crowd counting is a challenging yet critical task in computer vision with applications ranging from public safety to urban planning. Recent advances using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that estimate density maps have shown significant success. However, accurately counting individuals in highly congested scenes remains an open problem due to severe occlusions, scale variations, and perspective distortions, where people appear at drastically different sizes across the image. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning architecture that effectively addresses these challenges. Our network integrates a ResNet-based feature extractor for capturing rich hierarchical representations, followed by a downsampling block employing dilated convolutions to preserve spatial resolution while expanding the receptive field. An upsampling block using transposed convolutions reconstructs the high-resolution density map. Central to our architecture is a novel Perspective-aware Aggregation Module (PAM) designed to enhance robustness to scale and perspective variations by adaptively aggregating multi-scale contextual information. We detail the training procedure, including the loss functions and optimization strategies used. Our method is evaluated on three widely used benchmark datasets using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we incorporate principled Bayesian inference techniques to provide uncertainty estimates along with the crowd count predictions, offering a measure of confidence in the model's outputs.

Abstract: Batch effects in high-dimensional Cytometry by Time-of-Flight (CyTOF) data pose a challenge for comparative analysis across different experimental conditions or time points. Traditional batch normalization methods may fail to preserve the complex topological structures inherent in cellular populations. In this paper, we present a residual neural network-based method for point set registration specifically tailored to address batch normalization in CyTOF data while preserving the topological structure of cellular populations. By viewing the alignment problem as the movement of cells sampled from a target distribution along a regularized displacement vector field, similar to coherent point drift (CPD), our approach introduces a Jacobian-based cost function and geometry-aware statistical distances to ensure local topology preservation. We provide justification for the k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) graph preservation of the target data when the Jacobian cost is applied, which is crucial for maintaining biological relationships between cells. Furthermore, we introduce a stochastic approximation for high-dimensional registration, making alignment feasible for the high-dimensional space of CyTOF data. Our method is demonstrated on high-dimensional CyTOF dataset, effectively aligning distributions of cells while preserving the kNN-graph structure. This enables accurate batch normalization, facilitating reliable comparative analysis in biomedical research.

Abstract: 3D-aware face generators are typically trained on 2D real-life face image datasets that primarily consist of near-frontal face data, and as such, they are unable to construct one-quarter headshot 3D portraits with complete head, neck, and shoulder geometry. Two reasons account for this issue: First, existing facial recognition methods struggle with extracting facial data captured from large camera angles or back views. Second, it is challenging to learn a distribution of 3D portraits covering the one-quarter headshot region from single-view data due to significant geometric deformation caused by diverse body poses. To this end, we first create the dataset 360{\deg}-Portrait-HQ (360{\deg}PHQ for short) which consists of high-quality single-view real portraits annotated with a variety of camera parameters (the yaw angles span the entire 360{\deg} range) and body poses. We then propose 3DPortraitGAN, the first 3D-aware one-quarter headshot portrait generator that learns a canonical 3D avatar distribution from the 360{\deg}PHQ dataset with body pose self-learning. Our model can generate view-consistent portrait images from all camera angles with a canonical one-quarter headshot 3D representation. Our experiments show that the proposed framework can accurately predict portrait body poses and generate view-consistent, realistic portrait images with complete geometry from all camera angles.

Abstract: The integration of large pre-trained models (PTMs) into Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) has facilitated the development of computationally efficient strategies such as First-Session Adaptation (FSA), which fine-tunes the model solely on the first task while keeping it frozen for subsequent tasks. Although effective in homogeneous task sequences, these approaches struggle when faced with the heterogeneity of real-world task distributions. We introduce Plasticity-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation in Class-Incremental Learning (PLASTIC), a method that reinstates plasticity in CIL while preserving model stability. PLASTIC leverages Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) by dynamically fine-tuning LayerNorm parameters on unlabeled test data, enabling adaptability to evolving tasks and improving robustness against data corruption. To prevent TTA-induced model divergence and maintain stable learning across tasks, we introduce a teacher-student distillation framework, ensuring that adaptation remains controlled and generalizable. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PLASTIC consistently outperforms both conventional and state-of-the-art PTM-based CIL approaches, while also exhibiting inherent robustness to data corruptions.

Abstract: Seam cutting has shown significant effectiveness in the composition phase of image stitching, particularly for scenarios involving parallax. However, conventional implementations typically position seam-cutting as a downstream process contingent upon successful image alignment. This approach inherently assumes the existence of locally aligned regions where visually plausible seams can be established. Current alignment methods frequently fail to satisfy this prerequisite in large parallax scenarios despite considerable research efforts dedicated to improving alignment accuracy. In this paper, we propose an alignment-compensation paradigm that dissociates seam quality from initial alignment accuracy by integrating a Local Patch Alignment Module (LPAM) into the seam-cutting pipeline. Concretely, given the aligned images with an estimated initial seam, our method first identifies low-quality pixels along the seam through a seam quality assessment, then performs localized SIFT-flow alignment on the critical patches enclosing these pixels. Finally, we recomposite the aligned patches using adaptive seam-cutting and merge them into the original aligned images to generate the final mosaic. Comprehensive experiments on large parallax stitching datasets demonstrate that LPAM significantly enhances stitching quality while maintaining computational efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/tlliao/LPAM_seam-cutting.

Abstract: With the goal of understanding the visual concepts that CLIP associates with text prompts, we show that the latent space of CLIP can be visualized solely in terms of linear transformations on simple geometric primitives like straight lines and circles. Although existing approaches achieve this by sketch-synthesis-through-optimization, they do so on the space of higher order B\'ezier curves, which exhibit a wastefully large set of structures that they can evolve into, as most of them are non-essential for generating meaningful sketches. We present CLIPDraw++, an algorithm that provides significantly better visualizations for CLIP text embeddings, using only simple primitive shapes like straight lines and circles. This constrains the set of possible outputs to linear transformations on these primitives, thereby exhibiting an inherently simpler mathematical form. The synthesis process of CLIPDraw++ can be tracked end-to-end, with each visual concept being expressed exclusively in terms of primitives. Project Page: https://clipdrawx.github.io/.

Abstract: Aerial object detection presents challenges from small object sizes, high density clustering, and image quality degradation from distance and motion blur. These factors create an information bottleneck where limited pixel representation cannot encode sufficient discriminative features. B2BDet addresses this with a two-stage framework that applies domain-specific super-resolution during inference, followed by detection using an enhanced YOLOv5 architecture. Unlike training-time super-resolution approaches that enhance learned representations, our method recovers visual information from each input image. The approach combines aerial-optimized SRGAN fine-tuning with architectural innovations including an Efficient Attention Module (EAM) and Cross-Layer Feature Pyramid Network (CLFPN). Evaluation across four aerial datasets shows performance gains, with VisDrone achieving 52.5% mAP using only 27.7M parameters. Ablation studies show that super-resolution preprocessing contributes +2.6% mAP improvement while architectural enhancements add +2.9%, yielding +5.5% total improvement over baseline YOLOv5. The method achieves computational efficiency with 53.8% parameter reduction compared to recent approaches while achieving strong small object detection performance.

Abstract: The practical deployment of diffusion models is still hindered by the high memory and computational overhead. Although quantization paves a way for model compression and acceleration, existing methods face challenges in achieving low-bit quantization efficiently. In this paper, we identify imbalanced activation distributions as a primary source of quantization difficulty, and propose to adjust these distributions through weight finetuning to be more quantization-friendly. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting finetuning as a practical and reliable solution. Building on this approach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those responsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly sensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under both local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while enhancing quantization efficiency. Our method demonstrates its efficacy across three high-resolution image generation tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance across multiple bit-width settings.

Abstract: Infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) has attracted much attention owing to the highly-complementary properties of the two image modalities. Due to the lack of ground-truth fused images, the fusion output of current deep-learning based methods heavily depends on the loss functions defined mathematically. As it is hard to well mathematically define the fused image without ground truth, the performance of existing fusion methods is limited. In this paper, we first propose to use natural language to express the objective of IVIF, which can avoid the explicit mathematical modeling of fusion output in current losses, and make full use of the advantage of language expression to improve the fusion performance. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive language-expressed fusion objective, and encode relevant texts into the multi-modal embedding space using CLIP. A language-driven fusion model is then constructed in the embedding space, by establishing the relationship among the embedded vectors to represent the fusion objective and input image modalities. Finally, a language-driven loss is derived to make the actual IVIF aligned with the embedded language-driven fusion model via supervised training. Experiments show that our method can obtain much better fusion results than existing techniques.

Abstract: Stereophotogrammetry is an established technique for scene understanding. Its origins go back to at least the 1800s when people first started to investigate using photographs to measure the physical properties of the world. Since then, thousands of approaches have been explored. The classic geometric technique of Shape from Stereo is built on using geometry to define constraints on scene and camera deep learning without any attempt to explicitly model the geometry. In this survey, we explore geometry-inspired deep learning-based frameworks. We compare and contrast geometry enforcing constraints integrated into deep learning frameworks for depth estimation and other closely related vision tasks. We present a new taxonomy for prevalent geometry enforcing constraints used in modern deep learning frameworks. We also present insightful observations and potential future research directions.

Abstract: Deep Learning models are incredibly data-hungry and require very large labeled datasets for supervised learning. As a consequence, these models often suffer from overfitting, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world examples. Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic images based on textual inputs. Leveraging the substantial datasets used to train these diffusion models, we propose a technique to utilize generated images to augment existing datasets. This paper explores various strategies for effective data augmentation to improve the out-of-domain generalization capabilities of deep learning models.

Abstract: Monitoring space objects is crucial for space situational awareness, yet reconstructing 3D satellite models from ground-based telescope images is challenging due to atmospheric turbulence, long observation distances, limited viewpoints, and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose a novel computational imaging framework that overcomes these obstacles by integrating a hybrid image pre-processing pipeline with a joint pose estimation and 3D reconstruction module based on controlled Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Branch-and-Bound (BnB) search. We validate our approach on both synthetic satellite datasets and on-sky observations of China's Tiangong Space Station and the International Space Station, achieving robust 3D reconstructions of low-Earth orbit satellites from ground-based data. Quantitative evaluations using SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and Chamfer Distance demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based approaches, and ablation studies confirm the critical role of each component. Our framework enables high-fidelity 3D satellite monitoring from Earth, offering a cost-effective alternative for space situational awareness.

Abstract: Large vision-language contrastive models (VLCMs), such as CLIP, have become foundational, demonstrating remarkable success across a variety of downstream tasks. Despite their advantages, these models, akin to other foundational systems, inherit biases from the disproportionate distribution of real-world data, leading to misconceptions about the actual environment. Prevalent datasets like ImageNet are often riddled with non-causal, spurious correlations that can diminish VLCM performance in scenarios where these contextual elements are absent. This study presents an investigation into how a simple linear probe can effectively distill task-specific core features from CLIP's embedding for downstream applications. Our analysis reveals that the CLIP text representations are often tainted by spurious correlations, inherited in the biased pre-training dataset. Empirical evidence suggests that relying on visual representations from CLIP, as opposed to text embedding, is more effective to refine the skewed perceptions in VLCMs, emphasizing the superior utility of visual representations in overcoming embedded biases. Our code can be found here.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Context-Aware Video Instance Segmentation (CAVIS), a novel framework designed to enhance instance association by integrating contextual information adjacent to each object. To efficiently extract and leverage this information, we propose the Context-Aware Instance Tracker (CAIT), which merges contextual data surrounding the instances with the core instance features to improve tracking accuracy. Additionally, we design the Prototypical Cross-frame Contrastive (PCC) loss, which ensures consistency in object-level features across frames, thereby significantly enhancing matching accuracy. CAVIS demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on all benchmark datasets in video instance segmentation (VIS) and video panoptic segmentation (VPS). Notably, our method excels on the OVIS dataset, known for its particularly challenging videos. Project page: https://seung-hun-lee.github.io/projects/CAVIS/

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach for general object segmentation from a monocular image, eliminating the need for manually labeled training data and enabling rapid, straightforward training and adaptation with minimal data. Our model initially learns from LiDAR during the training process, which is subsequently removed from the system, allowing it to function solely on monocular imagery. This study leverages the concept of the Stixel-World to recognize a medium level representation of its surroundings. Our network directly predicts a 2D multi-layer Stixel-World and is capable of recognizing and locating multiple, superimposed objects within an image. Due to the scarcity of comparable works, we have divided the capabilities into modules and present a free space detection in our experiments section. Furthermore, we introduce an improved method for generating Stixels from LiDAR data, which we use as ground truth for our network.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning has become the method of choice for image denoising. It involves the training of neural networks on large datasets composed of pairs of noisy and clean images. However, the necessity of training data that are specific to the targeted application constrains the widespread use of denoising networks. Recently, several approaches have been developed to overcome this difficulty by whether artificially generating realistic clean/noisy image pairs, or training exclusively on noisy images. In this paper, we show that, contrary to popular belief, denoising networks specialized in the removal of Gaussian noise can be efficiently leveraged in favor of real-world image denoising, even without additional training. For this to happen, an appropriate variance-stabilizing transform (VST) has to be applied beforehand. We propose an algorithm termed Noise2VST for the learning of such a model-free VST. Our approach requires only the input noisy image and an off-the-shelf Gaussian denoiser. We demonstrate through extensive experiments the efficiency and superiority of Noise2VST in comparison to existing methods trained in the absence of specific clean/noisy pairs.

Abstract: Reduced biquaternion (RB), as a four-dimensional algebra highly suitable for representing color pixels, has recently garnered significant attention from numerous scholars. In this paper, for color image processing problems, we introduce a concept of the non-negative RB matrix and then use the multiplication properties of RB to propose a non-negative RB matrix factorization (NRBMF) model. The NRBMF model is introduced to address the challenge of reasonably establishing a non-negative quaternion matrix factorization model, which is primarily hindered by the multiplication properties of traditional quaternions. Furthermore, this paper transforms the problem of solving the NRBMF model into an RB alternating non-negative least squares (RB-ANNLS) problem. Then, by introducing a method to compute the gradient of the real function with RB matrix variables, we solve the RB-ANNLS optimization problem using the RB projected gradient algorithm and conduct a convergence analysis of the algorithm. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NRBMF model in color face recognition.

<title>Towards Adversarial Robustness via Debiased High-Confidence Logit Alignment</title>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various visual tasks, their vulnerability to adversarial examples raises significant security concerns. Recent adversarial training methods leverage inverse adversarial attacks to generate high-confidence examples, aiming to align adversarial distributions with high-confidence class regions. However, our investigation reveals that under inverse adversarial attacks, high-confidence outputs are influenced by biased feature activations, causing models to rely on background features that lack a causal relationship with the labels. This spurious correlation bias leads to overfitting irrelevant background features during adversarial training, thereby degrading the model's robust performance and generalization capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Debiased High-Confidence Adversarial Training (DHAT), a novel approach that aligns adversarial logits with debiased high-confidence logits and restores proper attention by enhancing foreground logit orthogonality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DHAT achieves state-of-the-art robustness on both CIFAR and ImageNet-1K benchmarks, while significantly improving generalization by mitigating the feature bias inherent in inverse adversarial training approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/KejiaZhang-Robust/DHAT.

Abstract: An incomplete field-of-view (FOV) in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) can severely hinder the volumetric and bundle analyses of whole-brain white matter connectivity. Although existing works have investigated imputing the missing regions using deep generative models, it remains unclear how to specifically utilize additional information from paired multi-modality data and whether this can enhance the imputation quality and be useful for downstream tractography. To fill this gap, we propose a novel framework for imputing dMRI scans in the incomplete part of the FOV by integrating the learned diffusion features in the acquired part of the FOV to the complete brain anatomical structure. We hypothesize that by this design the proposed framework can enhance the imputation performance of the dMRI scans and therefore be useful for repairing whole-brain tractography in corrupted dMRI scans with incomplete FOV. We tested our framework on two cohorts from different sites with a total of 96 subjects and compared it with a baseline imputation method that treats the information from T1w and dMRI scans equally. The proposed framework achieved significant improvements in imputation performance, as demonstrated by angular correlation coefficient (p < 1E-5), and in downstream tractography accuracy, as demonstrated by Dice score (p < 0.01). Results suggest that the proposed framework improved imputation performance in dMRI scans by specifically utilizing additional information from paired multi-modality data, compared with the baseline method. The imputation achieved by the proposed framework enhances whole brain tractography, and therefore reduces the uncertainty when analyzing bundles associated with neurodegenerative.

Abstract: Model quantization is a promising method for accelerating and compressing diffusion models. Nevertheless, since post-training quantization (PTQ) fails catastrophically at low-bit cases, quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential. Unfortunately, the wide range and time-varying activations in diffusion models sharply increase the complexity of quantization, making existing QAT methods inefficient. Equivalent scaling can effectively reduce activation range, but previous methods remain the overall quantization error unchanged. More critically, these methods significantly disrupt the original weight distribution, resulting in poor weight initialization and challenging convergence during QAT training. In this paper, we propose a novel QAT framework for diffusion models, called DilateQuant. Specifically, we propose Weight Dilation (WD) that maximally dilates the unsaturated in-channel weights to a constrained range through equivalent scaling. WD decreases the activation range while preserving the original weight range, which steadily reduces the quantization error and ensures model convergence. To further enhance accuracy and efficiency, we design a Temporal Parallel Quantizer (TPQ) to address the time-varying activations and introduce a Block-wise Knowledge Distillation (BKD) to reduce resource consumption in training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DilateQuant significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Code is available at http://github.com/BienLuky/DilateQuant .

Abstract: Specimen-associated biodiversity data are crucial for biological, environmental, and conservation sciences. A rate shift is needed to extract data from specimen images efficiently, moving beyond human-mediated transcription. We developed `Hespi' (HErbarium Specimen sheet PIpeline) using advanced computer vision techniques to extract pre-catalogue data from primary specimen labels on herbarium specimens. Hespi integrates two object detection models: one for detecting the components of the sheet and another for fields on the primary primary specimen label. It classifies labels as printed, typed, handwritten, or mixed and uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for extraction. The text is then corrected against authoritative taxon databases and refined using a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM). Hespi accurately detects and extracts text from specimen sheets across international herbaria, and its modular design allows users to train and integrate custom models.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between 3D shapes is an important and long-standing problem in computer vision, graphics and beyond. While approaches based on machine learning dominate modern 3D shape matching, almost all existing (learning-based) methods require that at least one of the involved shapes is complete. In contrast, the most challenging and arguably most practically relevant setting of matching partially observed shapes, is currently underexplored. One important factor is that existing datasets contain only a small number of shapes (typically below 100), which are unable to serve data-hungry machine learning approaches, particularly in the unsupervised regime. In addition, the type of partiality present in existing datasets is often artificial and far from realistic. To address these limitations and to encourage research on these relevant settings, we provide a generic and flexible framework for the procedural generation of challenging partial shape matching scenarios. Our framework allows for a virtually infinite generation of partial shape matching instances from a finite set of shapes with complete geometry. Further, we manually create cross-dataset correspondences between seven existing (complete geometry) shape matching datasets, leading to a total of 2543 shapes. Based on this, we propose several challenging partial benchmark settings, for which we evaluate respective state-of-the-art methods as baselines.

Abstract: Video generation models are revolutionizing content creation, with image-to-video models drawing increasing attention due to their enhanced controllability, visual consistency, and practical applications. However, despite their popularity, these models rely on user-provided text and image prompts, and there is currently no dedicated dataset for studying these prompts. In this paper, we introduce TIP-I2V, the first large-scale dataset of over 1.70 million unique user-provided Text and Image Prompts specifically for Image-to-Video generation. Additionally, we provide the corresponding generated videos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models. We begin by outlining the time-consuming and costly process of curating this large-scale dataset. Next, we compare TIP-I2V to two popular prompt datasets, VidProM (text-to-video) and DiffusionDB (text-to-image), highlighting differences in both basic and semantic information. This dataset enables advancements in image-to-video research. For instance, to develop better models, researchers can use the prompts in TIP-I2V to analyze user preferences and evaluate the multi-dimensional performance of their trained models; and to enhance model safety, they may focus on addressing the misinformation issue caused by image-to-video models. The new research inspired by TIP-I2V and the differences with existing datasets emphasize the importance of a specialized image-to-video prompt dataset.

Abstract: We present ViTaM-D, a novel visual-tactile framework for reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction with distributed tactile sensing to enhance contact modeling. Existing methods, relying solely on visual inputs, often fail to capture occluded interactions and object deformation. To address this, we introduce DF-Field, a distributed force-aware contact representation leveraging kinetic and potential energy in hand-object interactions. ViTaM-D first reconstructs interactions using a visual network with contact constraint, then refines contact details through force-aware optimization, improving object deformation modeling. To evaluate deformable object reconstruction, we introduce the HOT dataset, featuring 600 hand-object interaction sequences in a high-precision simulation environment. Experiments on DexYCB and HOT datasets show that ViTaM-D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction accuracy for both rigid and deformable objects. DF-Field also proves more effective in refining hand poses and enhancing contact modeling than previous refinement methods.

Abstract: Endoluminal endoscopic procedures are essential for diagnosing colorectal cancer and other severe conditions in the digestive tract, urogenital system, and airways. 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis from endoscopic images are promising tools for enhancing diagnosis. Moreover, integrating physiological deformations and interaction with the endoscope enables the development of simulation tools from real video data. However, constrained camera trajectories and view-dependent lighting create artifacts, leading to inaccurate or overfitted reconstructions. We present PR-ENDO, a novel 3D reconstruction framework leveraging the unique property of endoscopic imaging, where a single light source is closely aligned with the camera. Our method separates light effects from tissue properties. PR-ENDO enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting with a physically based relightable model. We boost the traditional light transport formulation with a specialized MLP capturing complex light-related effects while ensuring reduced artifacts and better generalization across novel views. PR-ENDO achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to baseline methods on both public and in-house datasets. Unlike existing approaches, PR-ENDO enables tissue modifications while preserving a physically accurate response to light, making it closer to real-world clinical use.

Abstract: Gaze estimation encounters generalization challenges when dealing with out-of-distribution data. To address this problem, recent methods use neural radiance fields (NeRF) to generate augmented data. However, existing methods based on NeRF are computationally expensive and lack facial details. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become the prevailing representation of neural fields. While 3DGS has been extensively examined in head avatars, it faces challenges with accurate gaze control and generalization across different subjects. In this work, we propose GazeGaussian, the first high-fidelity gaze redirection method that uses a two-stream 3DGS model to represent the face and eye regions separately. Leveraging the unstructured nature of 3DGS, we develop a novel representation of the eye for rigid eye rotation based on the target gaze direction. To enable synthesis generalization across various subjects, we integrate an expression-guided module to inject subject-specific information into the neural renderer. Comprehensive experiments show that GazeGaussian outperforms existing methods in rendering speed, gaze redirection accuracy, and facial synthesis across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Photorealistic reconstruction of street scenes is essential for developing real-world simulators in autonomous driving. While recent methods based on 3D/4D Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated promising results, they still encounter challenges in complex street scenes due to the unpredictable motion of dynamic objects. Current methods typically decompose street scenes into static and dynamic objects, learning the Gaussians in either a supervised manner (e.g., w/ 3D bounding-box) or a self-supervised manner (e.g., w/o 3D bounding-box). However, these approaches do not effectively model the motions of dynamic objects (e.g., the motion speed of pedestrians is clearly different from that of vehicles), resulting in suboptimal scene decomposition. To address this, we propose Explicit Motion Decomposition (EMD), which models the motions of dynamic objects by introducing learnable motion embeddings to the Gaussians, enhancing the decomposition in street scenes. The proposed plug-and-play EMD module compensates for the lack of motion modeling in self-supervised street Gaussian splatting methods. We also introduce tailored training strategies to extend EMD to supervised approaches. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis performance in self-supervised settings.

Abstract: This paper presents VQ-SGen, a novel algorithm for high-quality creative sketch generation. Recent approaches have framed the task as pixel-based generation either as a whole or part-by-part, neglecting the intrinsic and contextual relationships among individual strokes, such as the shape and spatial positioning of both proximal and distant strokes. To overcome these limitations, we propose treating each stroke within a sketch as an entity and introducing a vector-quantized (VQ) stroke representation for fine-grained sketch generation. Our method follows a two-stage framework - in stage one, we decouple each stroke's shape and location information to ensure the VQ representation prioritizes stroke shape learning. In stage two, we feed the precise and compact representation into an auto-decoding Transformer to incorporate stroke semantics, positions, and shapes into the generation process. By utilizing tokenized stroke representation, our approach generates strokes with high fidelity and facilitates novel applications, such as text or class label conditioned generation and sketch completion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques on the CreativeSketch dataset, underscoring its effectiveness.

Abstract: Since 2023, Vector Quantization (VQ)-based discrete generation methods have rapidly dominated human motion generation, primarily surpassing diffusion-based continuous generation methods in standard performance metrics. However, VQ-based methods have inherent limitations. Representing continuous motion data as limited discrete tokens leads to inevitable information loss, reduces the diversity of generated motions, and restricts their ability to function effectively as motion priors or generation guidance. In contrast, the continuous space generation nature of diffusion-based methods makes them well-suited to address these limitations and with even potential for model scalability. In this work, we systematically investigate why current VQ-based methods perform well and explore the limitations of existing diffusion-based methods from the perspective of motion data representation and distribution. Drawing on these insights, we preserve the inherent strengths of a diffusion-based human motion generation model and gradually optimize it with inspiration from VQ-based approaches. Our approach introduces a human motion diffusion model enabled to perform masked autoregression, optimized with a reformed data representation and distribution. Additionally, we propose a more robust evaluation method to assess different approaches. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate our method outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performances.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification presents inherent challenges due to high spectral dimensionality, significant domain shifts, and limited availability of labeled data. To address these issues, we propose a novel Active Transfer Learning (ATL) framework built upon a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (SST) backbone. The framework integrates multistage transfer learning with an uncertainty-diversity-driven active learning mechanism that strategically selects highly informative and diverse samples for annotation, thereby significantly reducing labeling costs and mitigating sample redundancy. A dynamic layer freezing strategy is introduced to enhance transferability and computational efficiency, enabling selective adaptation of model layers based on domain shift characteristics. Furthermore, we incorporate a self-calibrated attention mechanism that dynamically refines spatial and spectral weights during adaptation, guided by uncertainty-aware feedback. A diversity-promoting sampling strategy ensures broad spectral coverage among selected samples, preventing overfitting to specific classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark cross-domain HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed SST-ATL framework achieves superior classification performance compared to conventional approaches. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/mahmad000/ATL-SST.

Abstract: Visual object counting is a fundamental computer vision task underpinning numerous real-world applications, from cell counting in biomedicine to traffic and wildlife monitoring. However, existing methods struggle to handle the challenge of stacked 3D objects in which most objects are hidden by those above them. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose a novel 3D counting approach that decomposes the task into two complementary subproblems - estimating the 3D geometry of the object stack and the occupancy ratio from multi-view images. By combining geometric reconstruction and deep learning-based depth analysis, our method can accurately count identical objects within containers, even when they are irregularly stacked. We validate our 3D Counting pipeline on diverse real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, which we will release publicly to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Scaling has not yet been convincingly demonstrated for pure self-supervised learning from video. However, prior work has focused evaluations on semantic-related tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ action classification, ImageNet classification, etc. In this paper we focus on evaluating self-supervised learning on non-semantic vision tasks that are more spatial (3D) and temporal (+1D = 4D), such as camera pose estimation, point and object tracking, and depth estimation. We show that by learning from very large video datasets, masked auto-encoding (MAE) with transformer video models actually scales, consistently improving performance on these 4D tasks, as model size increases from 20M all the way to the largest by far reported self-supervised video model $\unicode{x2013}$ 22B parameters. Rigorous apples-to-apples comparison with many recent image and video models demonstrates the benefits of scaling 4D representations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have shown a strong ability in visual perception, reasoning abilities, and vision-language understanding. However, the visual matching ability of MLLMs is rarely studied, despite finding the visual correspondence of objects is essential in computer vision. Our research reveals that the matching capabilities in recent MLLMs still exhibit systematic shortcomings, even with current strong MLLMs models, GPT-4o. In particular, we construct a Multimodal Visual Matching (MMVM) benchmark to fairly benchmark over 30 different MLLMs. The MMVM benchmark is built from 15 open-source datasets and Internet videos with manual annotation. We categorize the data samples of MMVM benchmark into eight aspects based on the required cues and capabilities to more comprehensively evaluate and analyze current MLLMs. In addition, we have designed an automatic annotation pipeline to generate the MMVM SFT dataset, including 220K visual matching data with reasoning annotation. To our knowledge, this is the first visual corresponding dataset and benchmark for the MLLM community. Finally, we present CoLVA, a novel contrastive MLLM with two novel technical designs: fine-grained vision expert with object-level contrastive learning and instruction augmentation strategy. The former learns instance discriminative tokens, while the latter further improves instruction following ability. CoLVA-InternVL2-4B achieves an overall accuracy (OA) of 49.80\% on the MMVM benchmark, surpassing GPT-4o and the best open-source MLLM, Qwen2VL-72B, by 7.15\% and 11.72\% OA, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our MMVM SFT dataset and our novel technical designs. Code, benchmark, dataset, and models will be released.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models face limitations in building extra-large scale outdoor scenes, primarily due to the lack of sufficiently large-scale and detailed datasets. In this paper, we present a extra-large fine-grained dataset with 10 billion points composed of 41,006 drone-captured high-resolution aerial images, covering 20 diverse and culturally significant scenes from worldwide locations such as Cambridge Uni main buildings, the Pyramids, and the Forbidden City Palace. Compared to existing datasets, ours offers significantly larger scale and higher detail, uniquely suited for fine-grained 3D applications. Each scene contains an accurate spatial layout and comprehensive structural information, supporting detailed 3D reconstruction tasks. By reconstructing environments using these detailed images, our dataset supports multiple applications, including outputs in the widely adopted COLMAP format, establishing a novel benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art large-scale Gaussian Splatting methods.The dataset's flexibility encourages innovations and supports model plug-ins, paving the way for future 3D breakthroughs. All datasets and code will be open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: Geometric constraints between feature matches are critical in 3D point cloud registration problems. Existing approaches typically model unordered matches as a consistency graph and sample consistent matches to generate hypotheses. However, explicit graph construction introduces noise, posing great challenges for handcrafted geometric constraints to render consistency. To overcome this, we propose HyperGCT, a flexible dynamic Hyper-GNN-learned geometric ConstrainT that leverages high-order consistency among 3D correspondences. To our knowledge, HyperGCT is the first method that mines robust geometric constraints from dynamic hypergraphs for 3D registration. By dynamically optimizing the hypergraph through vertex and edge feature aggregation, HyperGCT effectively captures the correlations among correspondences, leading to accurate hypothesis generation. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, KITTI-LC, and ETH show that HyperGCT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, HyperGCT is robust to graph noise, demonstrating a significant advantage in terms of generalization.

Abstract: A main bottleneck of learning-based robotic scene understanding methods is the heavy reliance on extensive annotated training data, which often limits their generalization ability. In LiDAR panoptic segmentation, this challenge becomes even more pronounced due to the need to simultaneously address both semantic and instance segmentation from complex, high-dimensional point cloud data. In this work, we address the challenge of LiDAR panoptic segmentation with very few labeled samples by leveraging recent advances in label-efficient vision panoptic segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel method, Limited-Label LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation (L3PS), which requires only a minimal amount of labeled data. Our approach first utilizes a label-efficient 2D network to generate panoptic pseudo-labels from a small set of annotated images, which are subsequently projected onto point clouds. We then introduce a novel 3D refinement module that capitalizes on the geometric properties of point clouds. By incorporating clustering techniques, sequential scan accumulation, and ground point separation, this module significantly enhances the accuracy of the pseudo-labels, improving segmentation quality by up to +10.6 PQ and +7.9 mIoU. We demonstrate that these refined pseudo-labels can be used to effectively train off-the-shelf LiDAR segmentation networks. Through extensive experiments, we show that L3PS not only outperforms existing methods but also substantially reduces the annotation burden. We release the code of our work at https://l3ps.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated strong versatility across various visual tasks. However, its large storage requirements and high computational cost pose challenges for practical deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective strategy for efficient deployment, but we identify two key challenges in SAM that hinder the effectiveness of existing PTQ methods: the heavy-tailed and skewed distribution of post-GELU activations, and significant inter-channel variation in linear projection activations. To address these challenges, we propose AHCPTQ, an accurate and hardware-efficient PTQ method for SAM. AHCPTQ introduces hardware-compatible Hybrid Log-Uniform Quantization (HLUQ) to manage post-GELU activations, employing log2 quantization for dense small values and uniform quantization for sparse large values to enhance quantization resolution. Additionally, AHCPTQ incorporates Channel-Aware Grouping (CAG) to mitigate inter-channel variation by progressively clustering activation channels with similar distributions, enabling them to share quantization parameters and improving hardware efficiency. The combination of HLUQ and CAG not only enhances quantization effectiveness but also ensures compatibility with efficient hardware execution. For instance, under the W4A4 configuration on the SAM-L model, AHCPTQ achieves 36.6% mAP on instance segmentation with the DINO detector, while achieving a 7.89x speedup and 8.64x energy efficiency over its floating-point counterpart in FPGA implementation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have spurred interest in personalized human image generation, which aims to create novel images featuring specific human identities as reference images indicate. Although existing methods achieve high-fidelity identity preservation, they often struggle with limited multi-ID usability and inadequate facial editability. We present DynamicID, a tuning-free framework supported by a dual-stage training paradigm that inherently facilitates both single-ID and multi-ID personalized generation with high fidelity and flexible facial editability. Our key innovations include: 1) Semantic-Activated Attention (SAA), which employs query-level activation gating to minimize disruption to the original model when injecting ID features and achieve multi-ID personalization without requiring multi-ID samples during training. 2) Identity-Motion Reconfigurator (IMR), which leverages contrastive learning to effectively disentangle and re-entangle facial motion and identity features, thereby enabling flexible facial editing. Additionally, we have developed a curated VariFace-10k facial dataset, comprising 10k unique individuals, each represented by 35 distinct facial images. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamicID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, facial editability, and multi-ID personalization capability.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in foundational computer vision research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily focuses on $\textbf{coarse}$ facial attribute understanding, with limited capacity to handle $\textbf{fine-grained}$ facial attributes and without addressing generation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose UniF$^2$ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train UniF$^2$ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, UniF$^2$ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on UniF$^2$ace-130K demonstrate that UniF$^2$ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating high-quality images but also raise people's concerns about generating harmful or misleading content. While extensive approaches have been proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch, they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial prompts designed to circumvent content filters. Code is available at: https://github.com/NANSirun/Interpret-then-deactivate.

Abstract: Camera control has been actively studied in text or image conditioned video generation tasks. However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism--its capability is often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our method also finds promising applications in video stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/ReCamMaster.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) are accelerating the development of digital pathology algorithms and transforming biomedical research. These models learn, in a self-supervised manner, to represent histological features in highly heterogeneous tiles extracted from whole-slide images (WSIs) of real-world patient samples. The performance of these FMs is significantly influenced by the size, diversity, and balance of the pre-training data. However, data selection has been primarily guided by expert knowledge at the WSI level, focusing on factors such as disease classification and tissue types, while largely overlooking the granular details available at the tile level. In this paper, we investigate the potential of unsupervised automatic data curation at the tile-level, taking into account 350 million tiles. Specifically, we apply hierarchical clustering trees to pre-extracted tile embeddings, allowing us to sample balanced datasets uniformly across the embedding space of the pretrained FM. We further identify these datasets are subject to a trade-off between size and balance, potentially compromising the quality of representations learned by FMs, and propose tailored batch sampling strategies to mitigate this effect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through improved performance on a diverse range of clinically relevant downstream tasks.

Abstract: Modeling label correlations has always played a pivotal role in multi-label image classification (MLC), attracting significant attention from researchers. However, recent studies have overemphasized co-occurrence relationships among labels, which can lead to overfitting risk on this overemphasis, resulting in suboptimal models. To tackle this problem, we advocate for balancing correlative and discriminative relationships among labels to mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance model performance. To this end, we propose the Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning framework, a novel and parameter-efficient method that groups classes into multiple class subsets according to label co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships, and then models them respectively to balance the two relationships. In this work, since each group contains multiple classes, multiple prompt tokens are adopted within Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture the correlation or discriminative label relationship within each group, and effectively learn correlation or discriminative representations for class subsets. On the other hand, each group contains multiple group-aware visual representations that may correspond to multiple classes, and the mixture of experts (MoE) model can cleverly assign them from the group-aware to the label-aware, adaptively obtaining label-aware representation, which is more conducive to classification. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach achieves competitive results and outperforms SOTA methods on multiple pre-trained models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has revolutionized image creation, enabling high-quality synthesis from text prompts while raising critical challenges for media authenticity. We present Ai-GenBench, a novel benchmark designed to address the urgent need for robust detection of AI-generated images in real-world scenarios. Unlike existing solutions that evaluate models on static datasets, Ai-GenBench introduces a temporal evaluation framework where detection methods are incrementally trained on synthetic images, historically ordered by their generative models, to test their ability to generalize to new generative models, such as the transition from GANs to diffusion models. Our benchmark focuses on high-quality, diverse visual content and overcomes key limitations of current approaches, including arbitrary dataset splits, unfair comparisons, and excessive computational demands. Ai-GenBench provides a comprehensive dataset, a standardized evaluation protocol, and accessible tools for both researchers and non-experts (e.g., journalists, fact-checkers), ensuring reproducibility while maintaining practical training requirements. By establishing clear evaluation rules and controlled augmentation strategies, Ai-GenBench enables meaningful comparison of detection methods and scalable solutions. Code and data are publicly available to ensure reproducibility and to support the development of robust forensic detectors to keep pace with the rise of new synthetic generators.

Abstract: Facial recognition systems have achieved remarkable success by leveraging deep neural networks, advanced loss functions, and large-scale datasets. However, their performance often deteriorates in real-world scenarios involving low-quality facial images. Such degradations, common in surveillance footage or standoff imaging include low resolution, motion blur, and various distortions, resulting in a substantial domain gap from the high-quality data typically used during training. While existing approaches attempt to address robustness by modifying network architectures or modeling global spatial transformations, they frequently overlook local, non-rigid deformations that are inherently present in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce DArFace, a Deformation-Aware robust Face recognition framework that enhances robustness to such degradations without requiring paired high- and low-quality training samples. Our method adversarially integrates both global transformations (e.g., rotation, translation) and local elastic deformations during training to simulate realistic low-quality conditions. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive objective to enforce identity consistency across different deformed views. Extensive evaluations on low-quality benchmarks including TinyFace, IJB-B, and IJB-C demonstrate that DArFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with significant gains attributed to the inclusion of local deformation modeling.The code is available at the following https://github.com/sadafgulshad1/DArFace

Abstract: While humans can flexibly leverage interactive visual cognition for complex problem-solving, enabling Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to learn similarly adaptive behaviors with visual tools remains challenging. A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools. V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions. We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1 by +8.68 accuracy points. We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".

Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in egocentric videos presents unique challenges due to unstable viewpoints, motion blur, and off-screen speech sources - conditions under which traditional visual-centric methods degrade significantly. We introduce PAIR-Net (Pretrained Audio-Visual Integration with Regularization Network), an effective model that integrates a partially frozen Whisper audio encoder with a fine-tuned AV-HuBERT visual backbone to robustly fuse cross-modal cues. To counteract modality imbalance, we introduce an inter-modal alignment loss that synchronizes audio and visual representations, enabling more consistent convergence across modalities. Without relying on multi-speaker context or ideal frontal views, PAIR-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Ego4D ASD benchmark with 76.6% mAP, surpassing LoCoNet and STHG by 8.2% and 12.9% mAP, respectively. Our results highlight the value of pretrained audio priors and alignment-based fusion for robust ASD under real-world egocentric conditions.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC), and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode, where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously. Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46% under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large, high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1) Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood. CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets, surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats. Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the $l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs, PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLMs) blocks with Vision Transformers (ViTs) holds immense promise for vision-only tasks by leveraging the rich semantic knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, a fundamental challenge lies in the inherent modality mismatch between text-centric pretraining of LLMs and vision-centric training of ViTs. Direct fusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from unstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the vision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce Language-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges this modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT co-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and (2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM block using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to produce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT significantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks, showcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for visual understanding.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce MGA-Net, a novel mask-guided attention neural network, which extends the U-net model for precision neonatal brain imaging. MGA-Net is designed to extract the brain from other structures and reconstruct high-quality brain images. The network employs a common encoder and two decoders: one for brain mask extraction and the other for brain region reconstruction. A key feature of MGA-Net is its high-level mask-guided attention module, which leverages features from the brain mask decoder to enhance image reconstruction. To enable the same encoder and decoder to process both MRI and ultrasound (US) images, MGA-Net integrates sinusoidal positional encoding. This encoding assigns distinct positional values to MRI and US images, allowing the model to effectively learn from both modalities. Consequently, features learned from a single modality can aid in learning a modality with less available data, such as US. We extensively validated the proposed MGA-Net on diverse datasets from varied clinical settings and neonatal age groups. The metrics used for assessment included the DICE similarity coefficient, recall, and accuracy for image segmentation; structural similarity for image reconstruction; and root mean squared error for total brain volume estimation from 3D ultrasound images. Our results demonstrate that MGA-Net significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering superior performance in brain extraction and segmentation while achieving high precision in image reconstruction and volumetric analysis. Thus, MGA-Net represents a robust and effective preprocessing tool for MRI and 3D ultrasound images, marking a significant advance in neuroimaging that enhances both research and clinical diagnostics in the neonatal period and beyond.

Abstract: Robust SLAM is a crucial enabler for autonomous navigation in natural, semi-structured environments such as parks and gardens. However, these environments present unique challenges for SLAM due to frequent seasonal changes, varying light conditions, and dense vegetation. These factors often degrade the performance of visual SLAM algorithms originally developed for structured urban environments. To address this gap, we present ROVER, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored for evaluating visual SLAM algorithms under diverse environmental conditions and spatial configurations. We captured the dataset with a robotic platform equipped with monocular, stereo, and RGBD cameras, as well as inertial sensors. It covers 39 recordings across five outdoor locations, collected through all seasons and various lighting scenarios, i.e., day, dusk, and night with and without external lighting. With this novel dataset, we evaluate several traditional and deep learning-based SLAM methods and study their performance in diverse challenging conditions. The results demonstrate that while stereo-inertial and RGBD configurations generally perform better under favorable lighting and moderate vegetation, most SLAM systems perform poorly in low-light and high-vegetation scenarios, particularly during summer and autumn. Our analysis highlights the need for improved adaptability in visual SLAM algorithms for outdoor applications, as current systems struggle with dynamic environmental factors affecting scale, feature extraction, and trajectory consistency. This dataset provides a solid foundation for advancing visual SLAM research in real-world, semi-structured environments, fostering the development of more resilient SLAM systems for long-term outdoor localization and mapping. The dataset and the code of the benchmark are available under https://iis-esslingen.github.io/rover.

Abstract: Pre-training Transformers in FP4 precision is becoming a promising approach to gain substantial speedup, but it comes with a considerable loss of accuracy. Microscaling (MX) data format provides a fine-grained per-group quantization method to improve the representation ability of the FP4 format and is supported by the next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture. However, training with MXFP4 data format still results in significant degradation and there is a lack of systematic research on the reason.
  In this work, we propose a novel training method TetraJet for a more accurate FP4 training. We comprehensively evaluate all of the quantizers involved in the training, and identify the weight oscillation problem in the forward pass as the main source of the degradation in MXFP4 training. Therefore, we introduce two novel methods, EMA Quantizer (Q-EMA) and Adaptive Ramping Optimizer (Q-Ramping), to resolve the oscillation problem. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers demonstrate that TetraJet consistently outperforms the existing 4-bit training methods, and Q-EMA & Q-Ramping can provide additional enhancement by effectively reducing oscillation. We decreased the accuracy degradation by more than $50\%$ compared to the baseline, and can even achieve competitive performance compared to full precision training.

Abstract: We aim to develop a goal specification method that is semantically clear, spatially sensitive, domain-agnostic, and intuitive for human users to guide agent interactions in 3D environments. Specifically, we propose a novel cross-view goal alignment framework that allows users to specify target objects using segmentation masks from their camera views rather than the agent's observations. We highlight that behavior cloning alone fails to align the agent's behavior with human intent when the human and agent camera views differ significantly. To address this, we introduce two auxiliary objectives: cross-view consistency loss and target visibility loss, which explicitly enhance the agent's spatial reasoning ability. According to this, we develop ROCKET-2, a state-of-the-art agent trained in Minecraft, achieving an improvement in the efficiency of inference 3x to 6x compared to ROCKET-1. We show that ROCKET-2 can directly interpret goals from human camera views, enabling better human-agent interaction. Remarkably, ROCKET-2 demonstrates zero-shot generalization capabilities: despite being trained exclusively on the Minecraft dataset, it can adapt and generalize to other 3D environments like Doom, DMLab, and Unreal through a simple action space mapping.

Abstract: Histopathology slide digitization introduces scanner-induced domain shift that can significantly impact computational pathology models based on deep learning methods. In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at a broad scale (slide-level or dataset-level) but not patch-level, which limits our comprehension of the impact of localized tissue characteristics on the accuracy of the deep learning models. To address this challenge, we present a domain shift analysis framework based on UWarp, a novel registration tool designed to accurately align histological slides scanned under varying conditions. UWarp employs a hierarchical registration approach, combining global affine transformations with fine-grained local corrections to achieve robust tissue patch alignment. We evaluate UWarp using two private datasets, CypathLung and BosomShieldBreast, containing whole slide images scanned by multiple devices. Our experiments demonstrate that UWarp outperforms existing open-source registration methods, achieving a median target registration error (TRE) of less than 4 pixels (<1 micrometer at 40x magnification) while significantly reducing computational time. Additionally, we apply UWarp to characterize scanner-induced local domain shift in the predictions of Breast-NEOprAIdict, a deep learning model for breast cancer pathological response prediction. We find that prediction variability is strongly correlated with tissue density on a given patch. Our findings highlight the importance of localized domain shift analysis and suggest that UWarp can serve as a valuable tool for improving model robustness and domain adaptation strategies in computational pathology.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications. Likelihood-based deep generative models have historically faced criticism for their unsatisfactory performance in OOD detection, often assigning higher likelihood to OOD data than in-distribution samples when applied to image data. In this work, we demonstrate that likelihood is not inherently flawed. Rather, several properties in the images space prohibit likelihood as a valid detection score. Given a sufficiently good likelihood estimator, specifically using the probability flow formulation of a diffusion model, we show that likelihood-based methods can still perform on par with state-of-the-art methods when applied in the representation space of pre-trained encoders. The code of our work can be found at $\href{https://github.com/limchaos/Likelihood-OOD.git}{\texttt{https://github.com/limchaos/Likelihood-OOD.git}}$.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images. Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to 0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Object Detection (UAV-OD) faces substantial challenges, including small target sizes, high-density distributions, and cluttered backgrounds in UAV imagery. Current algorithms often depend on hand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit limited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is threshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic architectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics, resulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks have yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specific challenges.To address these issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time Detection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the High-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone. HFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust semantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and occluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object Pyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with minimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection. Finally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware Positional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and localization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing explicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1% AP50 and 3.8% AP increase over the baseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter count by 4M.

Summary:
DEQReg introduces a novel registration framework based on Deep Equilibrium Models to address challenges in deformable medical image registration. It bridges the gap between classical optimization-based methods and modern machine learning approaches by formulating registration as an equilibrium-seeking problem. This approach ensures stable convergence and offers a theoretical guarantee unlike existing unrolling methods. DEQReg maintains constant memory usage, enabling unlimited iteration steps without the bottleneck faced by backpropagation through time. The framework achieves competitive registration performance on brain MRI and lung CT datasets while significantly reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art unrolling methods. A notable observation is that existing unrolling methods exhibit performance degradation beyond the training configuration, while DEQReg maintains stable convergence due to its equilibrium-seeking mechanism. This research contributes to advancing the field of medical image registration by offering an efficient and reliable approach. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is traditionally formulated as an optimization problem. While classical methods solve this problem iteratively, recent learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to mimic this process by unrolling the prediction of deformation fields in a fixed number of steps. However, classical methods typically converge after sufficient iterations, but learning-based unrolling methods lack a theoretical convergence guarantee and show instability empirically. In addition, unrolling methods have a practical bottleneck at training time: GPU memory usage grows linearly with the unrolling steps due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). To address both theoretical and practical challenges, we propose DEQReg, a novel registration framework based on Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ), which formulates registration as an equilibrium-seeking problem, establishing a natural connection between classical optimization and learning-based unrolling methods. DEQReg maintains constant memory usage, enabling theoretically unlimited iteration steps. Through extensive evaluation on the public brain MRI and lung CT datasets, we show that DEQReg can achieve competitive registration performance, while substantially reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art unrolling methods. We also reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the performance of existing unrolling methods first increases slightly then degrades irreversibly when the inference steps go beyond the training configuration. In contrast, DEQReg achieves stable convergence with its inbuilt equilibrium-seeking mechanism, bridging the gap between classical optimization-based and modern learning-based registration methods.

Summary:
In this work, the authors highlight the difficulties faced by generative text-to-image models in adhering to prompts due to the noisy nature of large-scale datasets like LAION-5B. To address this issue, they introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a subset of the dataset comprising high-quality images with structured captions following a specific template. By fine-tuning PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly shuffled captions, they demonstrate that the structured versions lead to improved text-image alignment scores. The dataset, containing 19 million images, is made publicly available. This structured approach enhances model controllability and alignment, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of generative text-to-image models.

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/supermodelresearch/Re-LAION-Caption19M.

<div> Keywords: image generation, deepfake detection, face forgery, multimodal approaches, visual detail enhancement

Summary: 
CorrDetail is a new framework introduced for interpretable face forgery detection, addressing the shortcomings of existing techniques by focusing on visual detail enhancement. The framework uses error-guided questioning to rectify authentic forgery details, aiming to uncover forgery details rather than producing hallucinated responses. A visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated to provide more precise visual forgery details. A fusion decision strategy is also devised to enhance the model's discriminative capacity, particularly in handling extreme samples by compensating for visual information and reducing model bias. Experimental results show that CorrDetail outperforms existing methodologies in terms of accuracy and generalization capabilities in detecting forged details in facial deepfakes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details, while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning, with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated, supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

<br />
Spotlight is a novel virtual staining approach that enhances the morphological representation of cellular structures in 3D imaging using machine learning. By incorporating histogram-based foreground estimation and shape-aware learning through Dice loss calculation, Spotlight enables the model to focus on biologically meaningful signals while maintaining pixel-level accuracy. This method improves the quality of virtual stains generated from label-free inputs by reducing background noise and artifacts, making them more suitable for tasks like segmentation and profiling. In a comparative analysis on a benchmark dataset, Spotlight outperformed existing virtual staining methods by better capturing relevant cellular features. Overall, Spotlight offers a simple yet effective solution to enhance the interpretability and utility of microscopy images through virtual staining.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures. Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware learning. Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy, resulting in virtual stains better suited for downstream tasks such as segmentation and profiling.

Summary:
Foundation models have shown promise in remote sensing and climate sciences, offering opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in agriculture-specific tasks like crop mapping, phenology estimation, and yield estimation is limited. This study evaluates existing foundational models for their effectiveness in agricultural tasks and proposes a framework for an ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). The study compares general-purpose foundational models in agriculture-specific requirements and tests two exemplary models in crop-related tasks.

Abstract: Food security remains a global concern as population grows and climate change intensifies, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural productivity. Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model tailored specifically to agriculture.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based approach to enhance the quality of underwater images by incorporating human subjective assessments. The method involves training a classifier network to differentiate between high and low-quality underwater images. Subsequently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are employed to refine the low-quality images using various enhancement criteria, such as color fidelity and image sharpness. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated using quantitative metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, along with qualitative analysis. Results indicate significant improvements in both perceived and measured image quality, particularly when considering factors like color fidelity and image sharpness. This approach showcases the potential of deep learning techniques, particularly GANs, in enhancing underwater image quality and offers a promising pathway for further developments in this area.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model -- particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured image quality.

<div> adapter, personalized federated learning, vision-language tasks, multi-modal, communication-efficient

Summary:
The article introduces pFedMMA, a personalized federated learning framework for vision-language tasks that utilizes multi-modal adapters. These adapters consist of modality-specific layers and a shared projection to align cross-modal features, enabling clients to adapt to personalized data distributions while collectively improving global generalization. The asymmetric optimization strategy allows for efficient communication by only exchanging the shared component during training rounds. Through extensive experiments on eleven datasets, including scenarios with domain and label shifts, pFedMMA demonstrates superior performance in balancing personalization and generalization compared to existing federated prompt tuning methods. The code for pFedMMA is available on GitHub for further exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods.

Summary:
LoongX is a hands-free image editing approach that leverages brain-computer interfaces and generative models to enable accessible and intuitive editing for individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. The system utilizes multimodal neurophysiological signals including EEG, fNIRS, PPG, and head motion data to capture user intent. By integrating the cross-scale state space module for modality-specific features and the dynamic gated fusion module for unified representation, LoongX aligns user intent with image edit semantics through a diffusion transformer. Pre-training the encoders using contrastive learning enhances alignment of cognitive states with semantic intentions from natural language. Experiment results show performance comparable to text-driven methods, demonstrating the promise of neural-driven generative models in cognitive-driven creative technologies. The release of datasets and code will support future research in this emerging field. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach for 3D scene editing that focuses on regional modifications while ensuring coherence across different perspectives. By leveraging 2D diffusion editing to identify modification regions and utilizing inverse rendering for 3D localization, the method allows for precise edits in 3D spaces. The process involves refining the frontal view, initializing a coarse 3D scene representation, and iteratively enhancing structural details and textures. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significant speedup, making 3D scene local editing more efficient and effective. <div>
arXiv:2507.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective approach to 3D scene local editing.

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks. ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances. iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities, generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference, and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22% for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies, respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn production systems.

Summary:<br />
This research introduces a novel approach to identifying cognitive status in older drivers using naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. Current diagnostic methods for cognitive decline, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), are often time-consuming and costly, leading to underdiagnosis. By analyzing real-world driving behavior, the study aims to extract digital fingerprints that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of MCI and AD. The framework proposed utilizes large vision models to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status, and predict disease progression. The research leverages the relationship between driving behavior and cognitive status, using the vehicle as a diagnostic tool to identify early warning signs of functional impairment. The ultimate goal is to enhance early detection, support proactive intervention strategies, and develop scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to address the societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the aging population. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times, cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the aging population.

<div> scale invariance, diffusion models, image generation, noise profiles, Cloud Diffusion Model

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach called the Cloud Diffusion Model for image generation. It highlights the limitations of traditional diffusion models that use white noise, which does not capture the scale invariance present in natural image sets. The proposed Cloud Diffusion Model incorporates scale invariant noise profiles that emphasize large scale correlations and de-emphasize small scale correlations. This new model is expected to lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and greater controllability in image generation tasks. The authors plan to build and train a Cloud Diffusion Model in a follow-up paper and compare its performance to classic white noise diffusion models. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise. The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

<div> diffusion model, multi-view images, mesh quality, surface reconstruction, LoomNet

Summary: <br /><br />
The article introduces LoomNet, a novel architecture for generating consistent multi-view images from a single input image. LoomNet addresses the challenge of spatial consistency in 3D mesh quality by leveraging a shared latent space for view consistency. It applies a diffusion model multiple times in parallel to generate encoding representing different viewpoints, which are then fused into a unified interpretation. This approach allows LoomNet to produce 16 high-quality and coherent views in just 15 seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of image quality and reconstruction metrics. Additionally, LoomNet demonstrates creativity by generating diverse and plausible novel views from the same input image. <div>

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes. For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just 15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

<br />
Summary: Motivated by the need for retrieval systems operating across modalities, llama-nemoretriever-colembed is introduced as a unified text-image retrieval model. It offers top-tier performance on various benchmarks with two model variants, 1B, and 3B. The 3B model excels with NDCG@5 scores of 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on ViDoRe V2, leading the leaderboards. By modifying the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model, bidirectional attention replaces causal attention, and a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism is integrated for fine multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. However, this leads to trade-offs in storage and efficiency, as analyzed comprehensively. A two-stage training strategy is adopted to enhance the model's retrieval abilities. <div>

Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for retrieval systems that operate across modalities, we introduce llama-nemoretriever-colembed, a unified text-image retrieval model that delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. We release two model variants, 1B and 3B. The 3B model achieves state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.
  Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM), modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the model's retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: The scarcity of autonomous vehicle datasets from developing regions, particularly across Africa's diverse urban, rural, and unpaved roads, remains a key obstacle to robust perception in low-resource settings. We present a procedural augmentation pipeline that enhances low-cost monocular dashcam footage with realistic refractive distortions and weather-induced artifacts tailored to challenging African driving scenarios. Our refractive module simulates optical effects from low-quality lenses and air turbulence, including lens distortion, Perlin noise, Thin-Plate Spline (TPS), and divergence-free (incompressible) warps. The weather module adds homogeneous fog, heterogeneous fog, and lens flare. To establish a benchmark, we provide baseline performance using three image restoration models. To support perception research in underrepresented African contexts, without costly data collection, labeling, or simulation, we release our distortion toolkit, augmented dataset splits, and benchmark results.

<div> large language models, layout generation, spatial relationships, design elements, ReLayout

Summary:
ReLayout is a novel method that uses relation-CoT to improve content-aware layout generation by incorporating explicit definitions of relationships like region, salient, and margin between elements. This approach helps in decomposing layouts into structured and recursive components, resulting in more aesthetically coherent layouts. The method also introduces a layout prototype rebalance sampler to address issues with data bias in the prototype distribution balance process, ensuring a more uniform generation of layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that ReLayout outperforms existing methods by generating more structured and diverse layouts that are in line with human aesthetics and are more explainable. <div>
arXiv:2507.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human aesthetics and more explainable.

Summary:
- The paper introduces a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) for multi-modal face anti-spoofing.
- CTNet aims to address the distribution discrepancies in different modalities and handle missing modalities during inference.
- The network focuses on learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to create a generalized feature space.
- It also learns inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to identify out-of-distribution attacks.
- Additionally, CTNet learns complementary infrared (IR) and depth features as auxiliary modalities from the RGB modality.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB, infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS. Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

<div> conditional diffusion, defect detection, semi-supervised, industrial quality inspection, data efficiency 

Summary:
In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection is crucial for high-precision sectors such as automotive and medical devices. Traditional methods are inefficient and costly. This paper introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework, DSYM, using conditional diffusion. The framework leverages collaborative training and joint optimization, incorporating both labeled and unlabeled data. It synthesizes pseudo-defect samples and utilizes a noise filtering mechanism to improve accuracy. Experimental results on the NEU-DET dataset show significant advantages in data efficiency, achieving a high mAP@0.5 with less labeled data compared to traditional supervised methods. The research provides a low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality inspection scenarios. The open-sourced code is available at https://github.com/cLin-c/Semisupervised-DSYM.

Abstract: In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms, suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision, low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality inspection scenarios.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame. Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP) based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

Summary:
Accordion is a graphic design generation framework that aims to convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs. It uses a vision language model in three distinct stages, guided by prompts to execute various tasks. Unlike bottom-up methods, Accordion works in a top-down manner, using a visually harmonious reference image to decompose each layer. It leverages multiple vision experts to facilitate the creation of graphic layers and refines nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user prompts. The method is trained on a dataset augmented with AI-generated design images and refined ground truth created by a customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies show that Accordion generates favorable results on various design tasks, excelling in tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background, text de-rendering, and creating design variations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers, influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods (e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer. Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background, and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

Summary: 
The article introduces Kernel Density Steering (KDS), an inference-time framework designed to enhance image restoration using diffusion models. KDS employs an ensemble of diffusion samples to compute patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients, steering patches towards higher-density regions identified collectively within the ensemble. This collective local mode-seeking mechanism helps avoid artifacts and improves output quality by steering samples away from spurious modes. KDS does not require retraining or external verifiers, making it a plug-and-play framework that can be integrated with various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate that KDS significantly improves quantitative and qualitative performance on challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples, computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared, higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach called Generative HMC (GenHMC) to enhance photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality by generating high-quality synthetic images from unpaired head-mounted camera (HMC) captures. Traditional methods relying on paired HMC and dome captures face challenges such as imperfect disentanglement between expression and style and operational expenses. GenHMC disentangles facial expression and appearance, providing more accurate ground truth, and can generalize to unseen identities. This approach improves data efficiency and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in generating synthetic HMC images and training universal face encoders from new HMC-avatar correspondences. <div>
arXiv:2507.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome) for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC), that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect, to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth. Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and state-of-the-art accuracy.

Summary:<br />
- The AdaptaGen framework proposes a hierarchical semantic optimization approach for domain-specific image generation.
- It integrates prompt optimization with multi-perspective understanding to capture semantic relationships globally and locally.
- A cross-modal adaptation mechanism helps in mitigating hallucinations in specialized domains and preserving core thematic elements.
- Two-phase caption semantic transformation during image generation maintains semantic coherence and enhances visual diversity.
- Experimental results show superior performance across diverse datasets, achieving improvements in image quality, diversity, and semantic consistency.<br /> 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity. However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately, overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis, resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40 categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category, demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and semantic consistency.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel retrieval paradigm called Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which allows users to submit multimodal queries consisting of a reference image and modification text. The proposed method, OFFSET, addresses two key limitations in CIR. Firstly, it incorporates a focus mapping-based feature extractor that identifies significant dominant portions in images and guides the extraction of visual and textual features to reduce noise interference. Secondly, a textually guided focus revision module uses modification requirements from the text to enhance the perception of the modification focus on composed features. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OFFSET in improving retrieval accuracy in CIR tasks.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation, and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping. It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features. The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform, which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically, the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components. During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation. Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

<div> Keywords: vision-language models, generalization ability, new class recognition, dynamic rank adaptation, feature importance grouping

Summary:
Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA) is proposed as a novel adapter variant method to improve new class generalization in vision-language models. By dynamically allocating adaptation ranks based on feature importance, DRA aims to preserve general knowledge and enhance performance on unseen classes. The method evaluates and groups tokens by their importance, adapting feature ranks accordingly. A channel response mechanism prioritizes informative feature channels, while L1 regularization stabilizes training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DRA in enhancing new class performance across various benchmarks, including base-new classes and domain generalization. The source code will be made available after publication. <div>
arXiv:2507.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1 regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is received.

<div> Keywords: brain lesions, MRI, segmentation, tissue deformations, reverse process

Summary: 
In this study, a novel diffusion model-based framework for analyzing and reversing brain lesion processes is introduced. The framework first segments abnormal brain regions, then estimates and reverses tissue deformations to isolate the core lesion area representing the initial damage. By inpainting the core lesion area, the framework arrives at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain. This approach offers improved accuracy in lesion segmentation and brain labeling compared to traditional methods, providing a valuable tool for clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Although validation using pre-lesion healthy brain images is not possible due to the unavailability of such data in public datasets, the study simulates a forward model to synthesize multiple lesioned brain images for analysis. <div>
arXiv:2507.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain. This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize multiple lesioned brain images.

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives, which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13% across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios, providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further research in medical video generation.

arXiv:2507.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings: base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

Summary: 
The article introduces LiON-LoRA, a new framework for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) that enhances control over camera trajectories and object motion. LiON-LoRA improves upon traditional LoRA by incorporating principles of Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. By analyzing the orthogonality of LoRA features and enforcing norm consistency across layers, LiON-LoRA achieves better controllability and stability in fusion during complex camera motions. The framework also integrates a controllable token into the diffusion transformer, allowing for linear adjustment of motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects. Furthermore, LiON-LoRA extends its capabilities to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos, enhancing spatial and temporal controllability. Experimental results show that LiON-LoRA outperforms existing methods in trajectory control accuracy and motion strength adjustment, demonstrating superior generalization with minimal training data. <div>

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations. Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT) to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos, unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal training data.

A beam-splitter prism ensures precise optical and temporal alignment between the two sensors. A RANSAC-based technique fuses information from RGB and event channels, leveraging their strengths for pose estimation. Dropout uncertainty estimation detects extreme conditions affecting either channel.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations, such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure, blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However, event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces SenseShift6D, a novel RGB-D dataset that explores the impact of real-world variations in illumination and sensor settings on 6D object-pose estimation. By capturing multiple sensor-lighting permutations for common household objects, the dataset enables testing the effectiveness of sensor control during test-time. Experiments show that applying sensor control leads to significant performance improvements over traditional data augmentation techniques, achieving similar or better results compared to increasing real-world training data diversity. Results indicate that adapting RGB or depth sensors individually is effective, while jointly adapting multimodal configurations yields even greater performance gains. SenseShift6D extends the evaluation paradigm by incorporating sensor-aware robustness, paving the way for adaptive perception systems that can operate effectively in uncertain real-world environments. The dataset is publicly available, along with associated scripts for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures, 9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels. For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire 101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive, self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain real-world environments.

Summary: 
DreamArt introduces a new framework for generating detailed articulated objects from single-view images. The framework consists of three stages: reconstructing part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes, fine-tuning a video diffusion model to capture articulation priors, and optimizing articulation motion and texture refinement. By combining image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion, DreamArt accurately captures part shapes and high-quality textures. The framework leverages movable part masks and amodal images to mitigate occlusion ambiguities and ensures plausible articulation for the generated objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DreamArt in generating high-fidelity articulated objects with accurate shape, appearance fidelity, and realistic articulation. The scalability of the framework makes it a valuable solution for generating articulated assets for various applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR. <div>
arXiv:2507.05763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR. Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

This paper addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text instructions, including full outfit change and local editing. Previous methods primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly. Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of multi-modal models, this approach achieves fully automated local editings, enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to the current methods.

<div> Keywords: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation, Vision-language models, Spatial relation reasoning, Spatial-aware Denoising Network, Relation graph transformer

Summary: 
SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) is proposed for open-vocabulary Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG), integrating instance segmentation with relation understanding. The framework addresses limitations in spatial relation reasoning by calibrating a pre-trained diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network and incorporating spatial-aware context reasoning. SPADE outperforms existing methods in both closed- and open-set scenarios, especially in spatial relationship prediction. The inversion-guided calibration process utilizes cross-attention maps and a fine-tuning strategy to adapt the diffusion model for PSG tasks. The spatial-aware relation graph transformer captures local and long-range contextual information, enabling the generation of high-quality relation queries. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPADE in capturing pixel-level structural relationships in complex scenes. <div>

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries. Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

Summary:
Document reconstruction is a crucial aspect of document analysis and recognition, but current methodologies face challenges such as error propagation and information loss in element layouts. To address these issues, the proposed Document Reconstruction via End-to-end Autoregressive Model (DREAM) offers a comprehensive solution. DREAM transforms text images into a sequence of document elements in an end-to-end process, preserving vital layout information. A standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, along with the introduction of a Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset, ensures accurate performance assessment. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance in document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition, formula recognition, and reading order detection. Overall, DREAM's approach to document reconstruction showcases competitive compatibility and efficiency across a range of subtasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks, subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the information related to element layouts, which are vital for document reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process, encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition, we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition, formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is competitive and compatible with various tasks.

The article discusses the importance of high-quality sensor data for developing safe autonomous driving functions. It highlights the challenges of real-world data acquisition, such as labeling costs and diverse scenario coverage limitations. The focus of the study is on the conditional generation of synthetic camera sensor data, with a particular emphasis on daytime variations. The research introduces the use of solar altitude as a global conditioning variable, which can be easily computed from geographical coordinates and local time, eliminating the need for manual labeling. Additionally, a tailored normalization approach is proposed to capture lighting characteristics and image noise sensitivity based on small changes in altitude. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using solar altitude as a conditioning variable in accurately representing lighting conditions and illumination-dependent image noise in diffusion models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage. Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently, we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context of diffusion models.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible, rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance, delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge. To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks. Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding, paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics, human-computer interaction, and beyond.

<div> Keywords: few-shot segmentation, semantic segmentation, annotation bottleneck, intra-image discrepancies, inter-image discrepancies

Summary:
I2R is a novel few-shot segmentation (FSS) method that addresses critical limitations in conventional approaches. By using category-specific high-level representations to aggregate global semantic cues from support and query images, I2R enables more precise inter-image region localization, bridging the semantic gap. Additionally, a directional masking strategy is implemented to suppress inconsistent pixel pairs, minimizing false negative and false positive predictions caused by visually similar yet semantically distinct regions within images. Experimental results show that I2R outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with significant improvements in mIoU on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i benchmarks under the 1-shot setting. This demonstrates the effectiveness of I2R in enhancing segmentation performance and generalization capabilities in the few-shot learning context.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars. Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1) The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1) Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual IHC images from H\&amp;E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models, providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis. However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on positional correspondence.By removing weakly paired terms in the joint marginal distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation matrices between H\&amp;E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing-based crop yield prediction remains a fundamental challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions.

To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA) module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

<div> Gaussian Splatting, Compression, Dynamic, 3D, Feedforward <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces Feedforward Compression of Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel framework for compressing dynamic Gaussian point cloud sequences in free-viewpoint video (FVV). It utilizes a Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding and sparse control points for inter-frame motion extraction. D-FCGS employs a dual prior-aware entropy model for feedforward compression, combining hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate estimation. Control-point-guided motion compensation and a refinement network are used for reconstruction to enhance view-consistent fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experimental results show that it achieves over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while maintaining visual quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for dynamic 3DGS, facilitating scalable FVV transmission and storage in immersive applications. <div>

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient compression of dynamic 3D representations remains a major challenge. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods, achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in immersive applications.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery. Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly, under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates. This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks, excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code and benchmark will be publicly available at https://github.com/supertyd/FlexTrack/tree/main.

<title>On the Effectiveness of Methods and Metrics for Explainable AI in Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification</title>

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories (faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast, robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings. Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods, metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

Abstract: State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images, based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer. Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and 5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench. Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/MGPO.

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets 56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video understanding.

<title>High-Fidelity and Generalizable Neural Surface Reconstruction with Sparse Feature Volumes</title>

Abstract: Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes. However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation, we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

<title>T-LoRA: Single Image Diffusion Model Customization Without Overfitting</title>

Abstract: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image, as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones, necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios.

arXiv:2507.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS dataset will be released soon.

<title>Exploring Partial Multi-Label Learning via Integrating Semantic Co-occurrence Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels, and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Machine learning-based Deepfake detection models have achieved impressive results on benchmark datasets, yet their performance often deteriorates significantly when evaluated on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we investigate an ensemble-based approach for improving the generalization of deepfake detection systems across diverse datasets. Building on a recent open-source benchmark, we combine prediction probabilities from several state-of-the-art asymmetric models proposed at top venues. Our experiments span two distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model consistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based predictions provide more stable and reliable performance in all scenarios. Our results suggest that asymmetric ensembling offers a robust and scalable solution for real-world deepfake detection where prior knowledge of forgery type or quality is often unavailable.

<title>Geo-Registration of Terrestrial LiDAR Point Clouds with Satellite Images without GNSS</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05999</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection. However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a 55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\% improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth dataset.

<title>TextPixs: Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware Attention and OCR-Guided Supervision</title>

arXiv:2507.06033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets, such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign language avatars.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text, predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production pipeline.

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior recognition and reasoning are critical for autonomous driving video understanding. However, existing methods often tend to dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM) that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions. Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for autonomous driving applications. The code is available at https://github.com/SixCorePeach/MCAM.

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central camera models.

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

Abstract: In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database (CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues. The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate (RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

<title>Reflections Unlock: Geometry-Aware Reflection Disentanglement in 3D Gaussian Splatting for Photorealistic Scenes Rendering</title>

Abstract: Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs) driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code is available at https://ref-unlock.github.io/.

Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

However, when involving generating multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images, resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In this study, SoftReMish, a new activation function designed to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks, is proposed. Using the MNIST dataset, a standard CNN architecture consisting of two convolutional layers, max pooling, and fully connected layers was implemented. SoftReMish was evaluated against popular activation functions including ReLU, Tanh, and Mish by replacing the activation function in all trainable layers. The model performance was assessed in terms of minimum training loss and maximum validation accuracy. Results showed that SoftReMish achieved a minimum loss (3.14e-8) and a validation accuracy (99.41%), outperforming all other functions tested. These findings demonstrate that SoftReMish offers better convergence behavior and generalization capability, making it a promising candidate for visual recognition tasks.

Abstract: Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself, with applications to shape analysis and matching.

Abstract: The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion. OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1) an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable, variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D content.

Abstract: Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly articles.
  We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters. Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1 scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models (VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3 remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

<title>CultureCLIP: Empowering CLIP with Cultural Awareness through Synthetic Images and Contextualized Captions</title>

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities. Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

<title>RSRefSeg 2: Decoupling Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation with Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction, and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2 surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex semantic interpretation.

Abstract: Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations, articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation. Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting, and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real videos while using 10,000 times less data and only 1 day in 4 GPUs, compared to 256 GPUs used in recent state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG) generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2) transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV 2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI technology.

Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of wounds and scale markers in clinical images remainsa significant challenge, crucial for effective wound management and automatedassessment. In this study, we propose a novel dual-attention U-Net++ archi-tecture, integrating channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms toaddress severe class imbalance and variability in medical images effectively.Initially, extensive benchmarking across diverse architectures and encoders via 5-fold cross-validation identified EfficientNet-B7 as the optimal encoder backbone.Subsequently, we independently trained two class-specific models with tailoredpreprocessing, extensive data augmentation, and Bayesian hyperparameter tun-ing (WandB sweeps). The final model ensemble utilized Test Time Augmentationto further enhance prediction reliability. Our approach was evaluated on a bench-mark dataset from the NBC 2025 & PCBBE 2025 competition. Segmentationperformance was quantified using a weighted F1-score (75% wounds, 25% scalemarkers), calculated externally by competition organizers on undisclosed hard-ware. The proposed approach achieved an F1-score of 0.8640, underscoring itseffectiveness for complex medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation, meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments. Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are required.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have received increasing attention in medical imaging, particularly in limited-angle computed tomography (LACT). Standard diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT, and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference, the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory, allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain, effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and 10% gain in SSIM.

Abstract: Two-factor authentication (2FA) has become widely adopted as an efficient and secure way to validate someone's identity online. Two-factor authentication is difficult in virtual reality (VR) because users are usually wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) which does not allow them to see their real-world surroundings. We present NRXR-ID, a technique to implement two-factor authentication while using extended reality systems and smartphones. The proposed method allows users to complete an authentication challenge using their smartphones without removing their HMD. We performed a user study where we explored four types of challenges for users, including a novel checkers-style challenge. Users responded to these challenges under three different configurations, including a technique that uses the smartphone to support gaze-based selection without the use of VR controllers. A 4X3 within-subjects design allowed us to study all the variations proposed. We collected performance metrics and performed user experience questionnaires to collect subjective impressions from 30 participants. Results suggest that the checkers-style visual matching challenge was the most appropriate option, followed by entering a digital PIN challenge submitted via the smartphone and answered within the VR environment.

Abstract: Ultrasound microvascular imaging (UMI) is often hindered by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially in contrast-free or deep tissue scenarios, which impairs subsequent vascular quantification and reliable disease diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Half-Angle-to-Half-Angle (HA2HA), a self-supervised denoising framework specifically designed for UMI. HA2HA constructs training pairs from complementary angular subsets of beamformed radio-frequency (RF) blood flow data, across which vascular signals remain consistent while noise varies. HA2HA was trained using in-vivo contrast-free pig kidney data and validated across diverse datasets, including contrast-free and contrast-enhanced data from pig kidneys, as well as human liver and kidney. An improvement exceeding 15 dB in both contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR was observed, indicating a substantial enhancement in image quality. In addition to power Doppler imaging, denoising directly in the RF domain is also beneficial for other downstream processing such as color Doppler imaging (CDI). CDI results of human liver derived from the HA2HA-denoised signals exhibited improved microvascular flow visualization, with a suppressed noisy background. HA2HA offers a label-free, generalizable, and clinically applicable solution for robust vascular imaging in both contrast-free and contrast-enhanced UMI.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training, featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models, including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

Abstract: Tumor segmentation in CT scans is key for diagnosis, surgery, and prognosis, yet segmentation masks are scarce because their creation requires time and expertise. Public abdominal CT datasets have from dozens to a couple thousand tumor masks, but hospitals have hundreds of thousands of tumor CTs with radiology reports. Thus, leveraging reports to improve segmentation is key for scaling. In this paper, we propose a report-supervision loss (R-Super) that converts radiology reports into voxel-wise supervision for tumor segmentation AI. We created a dataset with 6,718 CT-Report pairs (from the UCSF Hospital), and merged it with public CT-Mask datasets (from AbdomenAtlas 2.0). We used our R-Super to train with these masks and reports, and strongly improved tumor segmentation in internal and external validation--F1 Score increased by up to 16% with respect to training with masks only. By leveraging readily available radiology reports to supplement scarce segmentation masks, R-Super strongly improves AI performance both when very few training masks are available (e.g., 50), and when many masks were available (e.g., 1.7K).

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios. In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction, instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval with high success rates.

Abstract: Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a challenging inverse problem where missing angular projections lead to incomplete sinograms and severe artifacts in the reconstructed images. While recent learning-based methods have demonstrated effectiveness, most of them assume ideal, noise-free measurements and fail to address the impact of measurement noise. To overcome this limitation, we treat LACT as a sinogram inpainting task and propose a diffusion-based framework that completes missing angular views using a Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (MR-SDE) formulation. To improve robustness under realistic noise, we propose RNSD$^+$, a novel noise-aware rectification mechanism that explicitly models inference-time uncertainty, enabling reliable and robust reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses baseline models in data consistency and perceptual quality, and generalizes well across varying noise intensity and acquisition scenarios.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However, publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32 distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation learning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset. We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that our dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues affected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that confirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development. Our dataset is publicly available here: Part 1 at https://zenodo.org/records/15307021, Part 2 at https://zenodo.org/records/15312384 and Part 3 at https://zenodo.org/records/15312792

<title>3DGS_LSR:Large_Scale Relocation for Autonomous Driving Based on 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose 3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation. Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads, boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are transforming the field of computational pathology by offering new approaches to analyzing histopathology images. Typically relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across different tasks.

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge, interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at https://knowledge-graph-ui-4a7cb5.gitlab.io/.

<title>Fair Domain Generalization: An Information-Theoretic View</title>

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing methods.

<title>A novel framework for fully-automated co-registration of intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography imaging data</title>

Abstract: Aims: To develop a deep-learning (DL) framework that will allow fully automated longitudinal and circumferential co-registration of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Methods and results: Data from 230 patients (714 vessels) with acute coronary syndrome that underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-IVUS and OCT imaging in their non-culprit vessels were included in the present analysis. The lumen borders annotated by expert analysts in 61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames, and the side branches and calcific tissue identified in 10,000 NIRS-IVUS frames and 10,000 OCT frames, were used to train DL solutions for the automated extraction of these features. The trained DL solutions were used to process NIRS-IVUS and OCT images and their output was used by a dynamic time warping algorithm to co-register longitudinally the NIRS-IVUS and OCT images, while the circumferential registration of the IVUS and OCT was optimized through dynamic programming. On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed high concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and circumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance correlation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the circumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal and 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable performance to the analysts. The time needed for the DL pipeline to process imaging data from a vessel was <90s. Conclusion: The fully automated, DL-based framework introduced in this study for the co-registration of IVUS and OCT is fast and provides estimations that compare favorably to the expert analysts. These features renders it useful in research in the analysis of large-scale data collected in studies that incorporate multimodality imaging to characterize plaque composition.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle technology has been developed in the last decades with recent advances in sensing and computing technology. There is an urgent need to ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect diverse data under different driving environments.
  To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments, camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images, and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.

Abstract: Edge computing enables data processing closer to the source, significantly reducing latency an essential requirement for real-time vision-based analytics such as object detection in surveillance and smart city environments. However, these tasks place substantial demands on resource constrained edge devices, making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies including estimation based techniques and a greedy selection algorithm to direct image processing requests to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, comparing the proposed routers against widely used baseline techniques. The evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD, EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by 45% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy compared to accuracy-centric methods.

<title>Enhancing Synthetic CT from CBCT via Multimodal Fusion and End-To-End Registration</title>

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for intraoperative imaging due to its rapid acquisition and low radiation dose. However, CBCT images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality, outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings. Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However, achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures, followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices. Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG. NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG. Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably, NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

<title>LangMamba: A Language-driven Mamba Framework for Low-dose CT Denoising with Vision-language Models</title>

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but often degrades image quality, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. Existing deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings, overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT). LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising: Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs. Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to advance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model (VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens, which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training. Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities. Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM capabilities.

Abstract: The current state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) require extensive training on video datasets with mask annotations, limiting their effectiveness in handling challenging scenarios. However, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) introduces a new prompt-driven paradigm for image segmentation, offering new possibilities. In this study, we investigate SAM's potential for UVOS through different prompt strategies. We then propose UVOSAM, a mask-free paradigm for UVOS that utilizes the STD-Net tracker. STD-Net incorporates a spatial-temporal decoupled deformable attention mechanism to establish an effective correlation between intra- and inter-frame features, remarkably enhancing the quality of box prompts in complex video scenes. Extensive experiments on the DAVIS2017-unsupervised and YoutubeVIS19\&21 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of UVOSAM without mask supervision compared to existing mask-supervised methods, as well as its ability to generalize to weakly-annotated video datasets.

Abstract: We introduce StreamDiffusion, a real-time diffusion pipeline designed for interactive image generation. Existing diffusion models are adept at creating images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios involving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present a novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the batching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional wait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To handle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we design a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process. Moreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG), which requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant computations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG) algorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to only one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity filter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around 1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising levels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the conventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature acceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps on one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers over 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly reduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one RTX4090, respectively.

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is an important network of arteries connecting major circulations of the brain. Its vascular architecture is believed to affect the risk, severity, and clinical outcome of serious neurovascular diseases. However, characterizing the highly variable CoW anatomy is still a manual and time-consuming expert task. The CoW is usually imaged by two non-invasive angiographic imaging modalities, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA), but there exist limited datasets with annotations on CoW anatomy, especially for CTA. Therefore, we organized the TopCoW challenge with the release of an annotated CoW dataset. The TopCoW dataset is the first public dataset with voxel-level annotations for 13 CoW vessel components, enabled by virtual reality technology. It is also the first large dataset using 200 pairs of MRA and CTA from the same patients. As part of the benchmark, we invited submissions worldwide and attracted over 250 registered participants from six continents. The submissions were evaluated on both internal and external test datasets of 226 scans from over five centers. The top performing teams achieved over 90% Dice scores at segmenting the CoW components, over 80% F1 scores at detecting key CoW components, and over 70% balanced accuracy at classifying CoW variants for nearly all test sets. The best algorithms also showed clinical potential in classifying fetal-type posterior cerebral artery and locating aneurysms with CoW anatomy. TopCoW demonstrated the utility and versatility of CoW segmentation algorithms for a wide range of downstream clinical applications with explainability. The annotated datasets and best performing algorithms have been released as public Zenodo records to foster further methodological development and clinical tool building.

Abstract: Visible-infrared image pairs provide complementary information, enhancing the reliability and robustness of object detection applications in real-world scenarios. However, most existing methods face challenges in maintaining robustness under complex weather conditions, which limits their applicability. Meanwhile, the reliance on attention mechanisms in modality fusion introduces significant computational complexity and storage overhead, particularly when dealing with high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we propose the Cross-modality Fusion Mamba with Weather-removal (CFMW) to augment stability and cost-effectiveness under adverse weather conditions. Leveraging the proposed Perturbation-Adaptive Diffusion Model (PADM) and Cross-modality Fusion Mamba (CFM) modules, CFMW is able to reconstruct visual features affected by adverse weather, enriching the representation of image details. With efficient architecture design, CFMW is 3 times faster than Transformer-style fusion (e.g., CFT). To bridge the gap in relevant datasets, we construct a new Severe Weather Visible-Infrared (SWVI) dataset, encompassing diverse adverse weather scenarios such as rain, haze, and snow. The dataset contains 64,281 paired visible-infrared images, providing a valuable resource for future research. Extensive experiments on public datasets (i.e., M3FD and LLVIP) and the newly constructed SWVI dataset conclusively demonstrate that CFMW achieves state-of-the-art detection performance. Both the dataset and source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lhy-zjut/CFMW.

Abstract: Low-Light Video Enhancement (LLVE) seeks to restore dynamic or static scenes plagued by severe invisibility and noise. In this paper, we present an innovative video decomposition strategy that incorporates view-independent and view-dependent components to enhance the performance of LLVE. We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for the view-independent term (which primarily captures intrinsic appearance) and impose a scene-level continuity constraint on the view-dependent term (which mainly describes the shading condition) to achieve consistent and satisfactory decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a cross-frame interaction mechanism. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely recognized LLVE benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios. Our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new SOTA performance.

Abstract: Mobile service robots can benefit from object-level understanding of their environments, including the ability to distinguish object instances and re-identify previously seen instances. Object re-identification is challenging across different viewpoints and in scenes with significant appearance variation arising from weather or lighting changes. Existing works on object re-identification either focus on specific classes or require foreground segmentation. Further, these methods, along with object re-identification datasets, have limited consideration of challenges such as outdoor scenes and illumination changes. To address this problem, we introduce CODa Re-ID: an in-the-wild object re-identification dataset containing 1,037,814 observations of 557 objects across 8 classes under diverse lighting conditions and viewpoints. Further, we propose CLOVER, a representation learning method for object observations that can distinguish between static object instances without requiring foreground segmentation. We also introduce MapCLOVER, a method for scalably summarizing CLOVER descriptors for use in object maps and matching new observations to summarized descriptors. Our results show that CLOVER achieves superior performance in static object re-identification under varying lighting conditions and viewpoint changes and can generalize to unseen instances and classes.

Abstract: We introduce the largest abdominal CT dataset (termed AbdomenAtlas) of 20,460 three-dimensional CT volumes sourced from 112 hospitals across diverse populations, geographies, and facilities. AbdomenAtlas provides 673K high-quality masks of anatomical structures in the abdominal region annotated by a team of 10 radiologists with the help of AI algorithms. We start by having expert radiologists manually annotate 22 anatomical structures in 5,246 CT volumes. Following this, a semi-automatic annotation procedure is performed for the remaining CT volumes, where radiologists revise the annotations predicted by AI, and in turn, AI improves its predictions by learning from revised annotations. Such a large-scale, detailed-annotated, and multi-center dataset is needed for two reasons. Firstly, AbdomenAtlas provides important resources for AI development at scale, branded as large pre-trained models, which can alleviate the annotation workload of expert radiologists to transfer to broader clinical applications. Secondly, AbdomenAtlas establishes a large-scale benchmark for evaluating AI algorithms -- the more data we use to test the algorithms, the better we can guarantee reliable performance in complex clinical scenarios. An ISBI & MICCAI challenge named BodyMaps: Towards 3D Atlas of Human Body was launched using a subset of our AbdomenAtlas, aiming to stimulate AI innovation and to benchmark segmentation accuracy, inference efficiency, and domain generalizability. We hope our AbdomenAtlas can set the stage for larger-scale clinical trials and offer exceptional opportunities to practitioners in the medical imaging community.

Abstract: For multimodal skeleton-based action recognition, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are effective models. Still, their reliance on floating-point computations leads to high energy consumption, limiting their applicability in battery-powered devices. While energy-efficient, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) struggle to model skeleton dynamics, leading to suboptimal solutions. We propose Signal-SGN (Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which utilizes the temporal dimension of skeleton sequences as the spike time steps and represents features as multi-dimensional discrete stochastic signals for temporal-frequency domain feature extraction. It combines the 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) module and the Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) module to extract features from the skeleton represented as spiking form. Additionally, the Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Feature Fusion (MWTF) module is proposed to extract dynamic spiking features and capture frequency-specific characteristics, enhancing classification performance. Experiments across three large-scale datasets reveal Signal-SGN exceeding state-of-the-art SNN-based methods in accuracy and computational efficiency while attaining comparable performance with GCN methods and significantly reducing theoretical energy consumption.

Abstract: Hermit crabs play a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by dispersing seeds, cleaning up debris, and disturbing soil. They serve as vital indicators of marine environmental health, responding to climate change and pollution. Traditional survey methods, like quadrat sampling, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and environmentally dependent. This study presents an innovative approach combining UAV-based remote sensing with Super-Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) and the CRAB-YOLO detection network, a modification of YOLOv8s, to monitor hermit crabs. SRR enhances image quality by addressing issues such as motion blur and insufficient resolution, significantly improving detection accuracy over conventional low-resolution fuzzy images. The CRAB-YOLO network integrates three improvements for detection accuracy, hermit crab characteristics, and computational efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to other mainstream detection models. The RDN networks demonstrated the best image reconstruction performance, and CRAB-YOLO achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 69.5% on the SRR test set, a 40% improvement over the conventional Bicubic method with a magnification factor of 4. These results indicate that the proposed method is effective in detecting hermit crabs, offering a cost-effective and automated solution for extensive hermit crab monitoring, thereby aiding coastal benthos conservation.

Abstract: Underwater litter is widely spread across aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, and oceans, significantly impacting natural ecosystems. Current monitoring technologies for detecting underwater litter face limitations in survey efficiency, cost, and environmental conditions, highlighting the need for efficient, consumer-grade technologies for automatic detection. This research introduces the Aerial-Aquatic Speedy Scanner (AASS) combined with Super-Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) and an improved YOLOv8 detection network. AASS enhances data acquisition efficiency over traditional methods, capturing high-quality images that accurately identify underwater waste. SRR improves image-resolution by mitigating motion blur and insufficient resolution, thereby enhancing detection tasks. Specifically, the RCAN model achieved the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 78.6% for detection accuracy on reconstructed images among the tested SRR models. With a magnification factor of 4, the SRR test set shows an improved mAP compared to the conventional bicubic set. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting underwater litter.

Abstract: Images captured in challenging environments--such as nighttime, smoke, rainy weather, and underwater--often suffer from significant degradation, resulting in a substantial loss of visual quality. The effective restoration of these degraded images is critical for the subsequent vision tasks. While many existing approaches have successfully incorporated specific priors for individual tasks, these tailored solutions limit their applicability to other degradations. In this work, we propose a universal network architecture, dubbed ``ReviveDiff'', which can address various degradations and bring images back to life by enhancing and restoring their quality. Our approach is inspired by the observation that, unlike degradation caused by movement or electronic issues, quality degradation under adverse conditions primarily stems from natural media (such as fog, water, and low luminance), which generally preserves the original structures of objects. To restore the quality of such images, we leveraged the latest advancements in diffusion models and developed ReviveDiff to restore image quality from both macro and micro levels across some key factors determining image quality, such as sharpness, distortion, noise level, dynamic range, and color accuracy. We rigorously evaluated ReviveDiff on seven benchmark datasets covering five types of degrading conditions: Rainy, Underwater, Low-light, Smoke, and Nighttime Hazy. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReviveDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.

Abstract: Predicting stroke risk is a complex challenge that can be enhanced by integrating diverse clinically available data modalities. This study introduces a self-supervised multimodal framework that combines 3D brain imaging, clinical data, and image-derived features to improve stroke risk prediction prior to onset. By leveraging large unannotated clinical datasets, the framework captures complementary and synergistic information across image and tabular data modalities. Our approach is based on a contrastive learning framework that couples contrastive language-image pretraining with an image-tabular matching module, to better align multimodal data representations in a shared latent space. The model is trained on the UK Biobank, which includes structural brain MRI and clinical data. We benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal methods using tabular, image, and image-tabular combinations under diverse frozen and trainable model settings. The proposed model outperformed self-supervised tabular (image) methods by 2.6% (2.6%) in ROC-AUC and by 3.3% (5.6%) in balanced accuracy. Additionally, it showed a 7.6% increase in balanced accuracy compared to the best multimodal supervised model. Through interpretable tools, our approach demonstrated better integration of tabular and image data, providing richer and more aligned embeddings. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping heatmaps further revealed activated brain regions commonly associated in the literature with brain aging, stroke risk, and clinical outcomes. This robust self-supervised multimodal framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods for stroke risk prediction and offers a strong foundation for future studies integrating diverse data modalities to advance clinical predictive modelling.

Abstract: Deep neural networks, while achieving remarkable success across diverse tasks, demand significant resources, including computation, GPU memory, bandwidth, storage, and energy. Network quantization, as a standard compression and acceleration technique, reduces storage costs and enables potential inference acceleration by discretizing network weights and activations into a finite set of integer values. However, current quantization methods are often complex and sensitive, requiring extensive task-specific hyperparameters, where even a single misconfiguration can impair model performance, limiting generality across different models and tasks. In this paper, we propose Quantization without Tears (QwT), a method that simultaneously achieves quantization speed, accuracy, simplicity, and generality. The key insight of QwT is to incorporate a lightweight additional structure into the quantized network to mitigate information loss during quantization. This structure consists solely of a small set of linear layers, keeping the method simple and efficient. More importantly, it provides a closed-form solution, allowing us to improve accuracy effortlessly under 2 minutes. Extensive experiments across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks demonstrate that QwT is both highly effective and versatile. In fact, our approach offers a robust solution for network quantization that combines simplicity, accuracy, and adaptability, which provides new insights for the design of novel quantization paradigms. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/wujx2001/QwT

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high fidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish Long-Skip-Connections as critical architectural components for stable and efficient diffusion transformers. Codes are provided in the https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Skip-DiT.

Abstract: We present a concise derivation for several influential score-based diffusion models that relies on only a few textbook results. Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic, synthetic signals -- particularly natural images -- and often play a role in state-of-the-art algorithms for inverse problems in image processing. While these algorithms are often surprisingly simple, the theory behind them is not, and multiple complex theoretical justifications exist in the literature. Here, we provide a simple and largely self-contained theoretical justification for score-based diffusion models that is targeted towards the signal processing community. This approach leads to generic algorithmic templates for training and generating samples with diffusion models. We show that several influential diffusion models correspond to particular choices within these templates and demonstrate that alternative, more straightforward algorithmic choices can provide comparable results. This approach has the added benefit of enabling conditional sampling without any likelihood approximation.

Abstract: Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous generation model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at a resolution of 64*64. Extensive ablation studies, including out-of-distribution evaluations, further validate the effectiveness of our approach.PRG is available at https://github.com/opendilab/PRG.

Abstract: We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is at https://rand-ar.github.io/.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-3D generation techniques, current methods often suffer from geometric inconsistencies, commonly referred to as the Janus Problem. This paper identifies the root cause of the Janus Problem: viewpoint generation bias in diffusion models, which creates a significant gap between the actual generated viewpoint and the expected one required for optimizing the 3D model. To address this issue, we propose a tuning-free approach called the Attention and CLIP Guidance (ACG) mechanism. ACG enhances desired viewpoints by adaptively controlling cross-attention maps, employs CLIP-based view-text similarities to filter out erroneous viewpoints, and uses a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy with staged prompts to progressively refine 3D generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the Janus Problem without compromising generation speed, establishing ACG as an efficient, plug-and-play component for existing text-to-3D frameworks.

Abstract: Nearest neighbor (NN) graph based visual re-ranking has emerged as a powerful approach for improving retrieval accuracy, offering the advantages of effectively exploring high-dimensional manifolds without requiring additional fine-tuning. However, the effectiveness of NN graph-based re-ranking is fundamentally constrained by the quality of its edge connectivity, as incorrect connections between dissimilar (negative) images frequently occur. This is known as a noisy edge problem, which hinders the re-ranking performance of existing techniques and limits their potential. To remedy this issue, we propose a complementary denoising method based on Continuous Conditional Random Fields (C-CRF) that leverages statistical distances derived from similarity-based distributions. As a pre-processing step for enhancing NN graph-based retrieval, our approach constructs fully connected cliques around each anchor image and employs a novel statistical distance metric to robustly alleviate noisy edges before re-ranking while achieving efficient processing through offline computation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves three different NN graph-based re-ranking approaches, yielding significant gains in retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) involves localizing entities in a 3D scene referred to by natural language text. Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.

Abstract: Probabilistic human motion prediction aims to forecast multiple possible future movements from past observations. While current approaches report high diversity and realism, they often generate motions with undetected limb stretching and jitter. To address this, we introduce SkeletonDiffusion, a latent diffusion model that embeds an explicit inductive bias on the human body within its architecture and training. Our model is trained with a novel nonisotropic Gaussian diffusion formulation that aligns with the natural kinematic structure of the human skeleton. Results show that our approach outperforms conventional isotropic alternatives, consistently generating realistic predictions while avoiding artifacts such as limb distortion. Additionally, we identify a limitation in commonly used diversity metrics, which may inadvertently favor models that produce inconsistent limb lengths within the same sequence. SkeletonDiffusion sets a new benchmark on real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of image generation, achieving precise control over generated content and maintaining semantic consistency remain significant limitations, particularly concerning grounding techniques and the necessity for model fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose BayesGenie, an off-the-shelf approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization to facilitate precise and user-friendly image editing. Our method enables users to modify images through natural language descriptions without manual area marking, while preserving the original image's semantic integrity. Unlike existing techniques that require extensive pre-training or fine-tuning, our approach demonstrates remarkable adaptability across various LLMs through its model-agnostic design. BayesGenie employs an adapted Bayesian optimization strategy to automatically refine the inference process parameters, achieving high-precision image editing with minimal user intervention. Through extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in both editing accuracy and semantic preservation, as validated using different LLMs including Claude3 and GPT-4.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives--such as attributes and objects--that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose a Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) focuses on providing answers to natural language questions by utilizing information from images. Although cutting-edge multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o achieve strong performance on VQA tasks, they frequently fall short in accessing domain-specific or the latest knowledge. To mitigate this issue, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) leveraging external knowledge bases (KBs), referred to as KB-VQA, emerges as a promising approach. Nevertheless, conventional unimodal retrieval techniques, which translate images into textual descriptions, often result in the loss of critical visual details. To address these challenges, this study presents two key innovations. First, we introduce fine-grained knowledge units that consist of multimodal data fragments (e.g. text fragments, entity images, and so on) in a structured manner. Rather than merely refining retrieval mechanisms, we prioritize the systematic organization and management of these knowledge units, ensuring that the structuring process itself enhances retrieval quality. Second, we propose a knowledge unit retrieval-augmented generation framework (KU-RAG) that seamlessly integrates fine-grained retrieval with MLLMs. Our KU-RAG framework not only ensures precise retrieval of relevant knowledge but also enhances reasoning capabilities through a knowledge correction chain. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing KB-VQA methods across four benchmarks, achieving an average improvement of approximately 3% and up to 11% in the best case.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential due to their low energy consumption. Converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs is an efficient way to achieve high-performance SNNs. However, many conversion methods are based on rate coding, which requires numerous spikes and longer time-steps compared to directly trained SNNs, leading to increased energy consumption and latency. This article introduces differential coding for ANN-to-SNN conversion, a novel coding scheme that reduces spike counts and energy consumption by transmitting changes in rate information rather than rates directly, and explores its application across various layers. Additionally, the threshold iteration method is proposed to optimize thresholds based on activation distribution when converting Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to spiking neurons. Experimental results on various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers demonstrate that the proposed differential coding significantly improves accuracy while reducing energy consumption, particularly when combined with the threshold iteration method, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The source codes of the proposed method are available at https://github.com/h-z-h-cell/ANN-to-SNN-DCGS.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.

Abstract: Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from replicating human-like behaviors, generalizing effectively in multi-agent scenarios, and overcoming inherent interpretability issues.These tasks are compounded when deep environment understanding, agent coordination and dynamic optimization are required. While Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced methods have shown promise in generalization and interoperability, they often neglect necessary multi-agent coordination. Therefore, we introduce the Cascading Cooperative Multi-agent (CCMA) framework, integrating RL for individual interactions, a fine-tuned LLM for regional cooperation, a reward function for global optimization, and the Retrieval-augmented Generation mechanism to dynamically optimize decision-making across complex driving scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the CCMA outperforms existing RL methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both micro and macro-level performance in complex driving environments.

Abstract: We introduce Filter Like You Test (FLYT), an algorithm for curating large-scale vision-language datasets that learns the usefulness of each data point as a pretraining example. FLYT trains a scoring model that learns to weigh each example's features using gradient signals from downstream tasks training sets. Based on FLYT, we implement Mixing-FLYT (M-FLYT), which takes the per-example scores generated by different scoring methods as features, and learns to unify them into a single score. FLYT naturally produces a distribution over the training examples, which we leverage through Soft Cap Sampling (SCS), a strategy for obtaining a filtered pretraining dataset from per-example probabilities that samples examples while preventing over-representation through a repetition penalty. Using these methods, we achieve 40.1% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy on the DataComp medium scale filtering benchmark, a 2% absolute accuracy increase over all previous results and a 5.5% increase over results that - like us - use only public resources. Our approach also yields 37.7\% on the average of 38 DataComp evaluation tasks, outperforming previous public-resource approaches by 0.4\%.

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models in image generation, the demand for more powerful and flexible controllable frameworks is increasing. Although existing methods can guide generation beyond text prompts, the challenge of effectively combining multiple conditional inputs while maintaining consistency with all of them remains unsolved. To address this, we introduce UniCombine, a DiT-based multi-conditional controllable generative framework capable of handling any combination of conditions, including but not limited to text prompts, spatial maps, and subject images. Specifically, we introduce a novel Conditional MMDiT Attention mechanism and incorporate a trainable LoRA module to build both the training-free and training-based versions. Additionally, we propose a new pipeline to construct SubjectSpatial200K, the first dataset designed for multi-conditional generative tasks covering both the subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditions. Extensive experimental results on multi-conditional generation demonstrate the outstanding universality and powerful capability of our approach with state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Fire and smoke phenomena pose a significant threat to the natural environment, ecosystems, and global economy, as well as human lives and wildlife. In this particular circumstance, there is a demand for more sophisticated and advanced technologies to implement an effective strategy for early detection, real-time monitoring, and minimizing the overall impacts of fires on ecological balance and public safety. Recently, the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) frameworks has substantially revolutionized the momentum for developing efficient fire management systems. However, these systems extensively rely on the availability of adequate and high-quality fire and smoke data to create proficient Machine Learning (ML) methods for various tasks, such as detection and monitoring. Although fire and smoke datasets play a critical role in training, evaluating, and testing advanced Deep Learning (DL) models, a comprehensive review of the existing datasets is still unexplored. For this purpose, we provide an in-depth review to systematically analyze and evaluate fire and smoke datasets collected over the past 20 years. We investigate the characteristics of each dataset, including type, size, format, collection methods, and geographical diversities. We also review and highlight the unique features of each dataset, such as imaging modalities (RGB, thermal, infrared) and their applicability for different fire management tasks (classification, segmentation, detection). Furthermore, we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each dataset and discuss their potential for advancing research and technology in fire management. Ultimately, we conduct extensive experimental analyses across different datasets using several state-of-the-art algorithms, such as ResNet-50, DeepLab-V3, and YoloV8.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies and wearable devices, egocentric vision understanding has emerged as a new and challenging research direction, gradually attracting widespread attention from both academia and industry. Egocentric vision captures visual and multimodal data through cameras or sensors worn on the human body, offering a unique perspective that simulates human visual experiences. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the research on egocentric vision understanding, systematically analyzing the components of egocentric scenes and categorizing the tasks into four main areas: subject understanding, object understanding, environment understanding, and hybrid understanding. We explore in detail the sub-tasks within each category. We also summarize the main challenges and trends currently existing in the field. Furthermore, this paper presents an overview of high-quality egocentric vision datasets, offering valuable resources for future research. By summarizing the latest advancements, we anticipate the broad applications of egocentric vision technologies in fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence, and propose future research directions based on the latest developments in the field.

Abstract: Generative AI has significantly advanced text-driven image generation, but it still faces challenges in producing outputs that consistently align with evolving user preferences and intents, particularly in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.

Abstract: Although text-to-image generation technologies have made significant advancements, they still face challenges when dealing with ambiguous prompts and aligning outputs with user intent.Our proposed framework, TDRI (Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation), addresses these issues by enhancing image generation through iterative user interaction. It consists of two phases: the Initial Generation Phase, which creates base images based on user prompts, and the Interactive Refinement Phase, which integrates user feedback through three key modules. The Dialogue-to-Prompt (D2P) module ensures that user feedback is effectively transformed into actionable prompts, which improves the alignment between user intent and model input. By evaluating generated outputs against user expectations, the Feedback-Reflection (FR) module identifies discrepancies and facilitates improvements. In an effort to ensure consistently high-quality results, the Adaptive Optimization (AO) module fine-tunes the generation process by balancing user preferences and maintaining prompt fidelity. Experimental results show that TDRI outperforms existing methods by achieving 33.6% human preference, compared to 6.2% for GPT-4 augmentation, and the highest CLIP and BLIP alignment scores (0.338 and 0.336, respectively). In iterative feedback tasks, user satisfaction increased to 88% after 8 rounds, with diminishing returns beyond 6 rounds. Furthermore, TDRI has been found to reduce the number of iterations and improve personalization in the creation of fashion products. TDRI exhibits a strong potential for a wide range of applications in the creative and industrial domains, as it streamlines the creative process and improves alignment with user preferences

Abstract: High-resolution semantic segmentation is essential for applications such as image editing, bokeh imaging, AR/VR, etc. Unfortunately, existing datasets often have limited resolution and lack precise mask details and boundaries. In this work, we build a large-scale, matting-level semantic segmentation dataset, named MaSS13K, which consists of 13,348 real-world images, all at 4K resolution. MaSS13K provides high-quality mask annotations of a number of objects, which are categorized into seven categories: human, vegetation, ground, sky, water, building, and others. MaSS13K features precise masks, with an average mask complexity 20-50 times higher than existing semantic segmentation datasets. We consequently present a method specifically designed for high-resolution semantic segmentation, namely MaSSFormer, which employs an efficient pixel decoder that aggregates high-level semantic features and low-level texture features across three stages, aiming to produce high-resolution masks with minimal computational cost. Finally, we propose a new learning paradigm, which integrates the high-quality masks of the seven given categories with pseudo labels from new classes, enabling MaSSFormer to transfer its accurate segmentation capability to other classes of objects. Our proposed MaSSFormer is comprehensively evaluated on the MaSS13K benchmark together with 14 representative segmentation models. We expect that our meticulously annotated MaSS13K dataset and the MaSSFormer model can facilitate the research of high-resolution and high-quality semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has gained popularity for its shift towards next-scale prediction. However, existing VAR paradigms process the entire token map at each scale step, leading to the complexity and runtime scaling dramatically with image resolution. To address this challenge, we propose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution scaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from the large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this observation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards pivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from previous scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces the number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger resolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup FlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\times$ with negligible performance drop of <1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution images. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory footprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/csguoh/FastVAR.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SS-SS) aims to mitigate the heavy annotation burden of dense pixel labeling by leveraging abundant unlabeled images alongside a small labeled set. While current consistency regularization methods achieve strong results, they often overlook a critical challenge: the precise delineation of object boundaries. In this paper, we propose BoundMatch, a novel multi-task SS-SS framework that explicitly integrates semantic boundary detection into a teacher-student consistency regularization pipeline. Our core mechanism, Boundary Consistency Regularized Multi-Task Learning (BCRM), enforces prediction agreement between teacher and student models on both segmentation masks and detailed semantic boundaries. To further enhance performance and sharpen boundaries, BoundMatch incorporates two lightweight fusion modules: Boundary-Semantic Fusion (BSF) injects learned boundary cues into the segmentation decoder, while Spatial Gradient Fusion (SGF) refines boundary predictions using mask gradients, leading to higher-quality boundary pseudo-labels. This framework is built upon SAMTH, a strong teacher-student baseline featuring a Harmonious Batch Normalization (HBN) update strategy for improved stability. Extensive experiments on diverse urban-driving scene datasets including Cityscapes, BDD100K, and SYNTHIA show that BoundMatch achieves competitive performance against current state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the new benchmark with DINOv2 foundation model. We further validate our approach's generalizability on Pascal VOC and ADE20K datasets. Ablation studies highlight BoundMatch's ability to improve boundary-specific evaluation metrics, its effectiveness in realistic large-scale unlabeled data scenarios, and applicability to lightweight architectures for mobile deployment.

Abstract: Predicting future trajectories of surrounding vehicles heavily relies on what contextual information is given to a motion prediction model. The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) process images as a whole. Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and generate more realistic images. HDM essentially is a DDPM that incorporates an attention mechanism between pixels. In HDM, the discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).

Abstract: Generative models enhance neuroimaging through data augmentation, quality improvement, and rare condition studies. Despite advances in realistic synthetic MRIs, evaluations focus on texture and perception, lacking sensitivity to crucial anatomical fidelity. This study proposes a new metric, called WASABI (Wasserstein-Based Anatomical Brain Index), to assess the anatomical realism of synthetic brain MRIs. WASABI leverages \textit{SynthSeg}, a deep learning-based brain parcellation tool, to derive volumetric measures of brain regions in each MRI and uses the multivariate Wasserstein distance to compare distributions between real and synthetic anatomies. Based on controlled experiments on two real datasets and synthetic MRIs from five generative models, WASABI demonstrates higher sensitivity in quantifying anatomical discrepancies compared to traditional image-level metrics, even when synthetic images achieve near-perfect visual quality. Our findings advocate for shifting the evaluation paradigm beyond visual inspection and conventional metrics, emphasizing anatomical fidelity as a crucial benchmark for clinically meaningful brain MRI synthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/BahramJafrasteh/wasabi-mri.

Abstract: State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) is crucial for improving both human perception and computer vision tasks. This paper addresses two challenges in zero-reference LLIE: obtaining perceptually 'good' images using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model and maintaining computational efficiency for high-resolution images. We propose CLIP-Utilized Reinforcement learning-based Visual image Enhancement (CURVE). CURVE employs a simple image processing module which adjusts global image tone based on B\'ezier curve and estimates its processing parameters iteratively. The estimator is trained by reinforcement learning with rewards designed using CLIP text embeddings. Experiments on low-light and multi-exposure datasets demonstrate the performance of CURVE in terms of enhancement quality and processing speed compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in jointly advancing multimodal understanding and generation, with visual codebooks discretizing images into tokens for autoregressive modeling. Existing codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a 500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics. This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios. We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector. This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct advantages across various video benchmarks.

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting (B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling, automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements. Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

<title>An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (SR) tasks often do not have paired datasets, which limits the application of supervised techniques. As a result, the tasks are usually approached by unpaired techniques based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which yield complex training losses with several regularization terms, e.g., content or identity losses. While GANs usually provide good practical performance, they are used heuristically, i.e., theoretical understanding of their behaviour is yet rather limited. We theoretically investigate optimization problems which arise in such models and find two surprising observations. First, the learned SR map is always an optimal transport (OT) map. Second, we theoretically prove and empirically show that the learned map is biased, i.e., it does not actually transform the distribution of low-resolution images to high-resolution ones. Inspired by these findings, we investigate recent advances in neural OT field to resolve the bias issue. We establish an intriguing connection between regularized GANs and neural OT approaches. We show that unlike the existing GAN-based alternatives, these algorithms aim to learn an unbiased OT map. We empirically demonstrate our findings via a series of synthetic and real-world unpaired SR experiments. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/milenagazdieva/OT-Super-Resolution.

<title>AbdomenAtlas-8K: Annotating 8,000 CT Volumes for Multi-Organ Segmentation in Three Weeks</title>

Abstract: Annotating medical images, particularly for organ segmentation, is laborious and time-consuming. For example, annotating an abdominal organ requires an estimated rate of 30-60 minutes per CT volume based on the expertise of an annotator and the size, visibility, and complexity of the organ. Therefore, publicly available datasets for multi-organ segmentation are often limited in data size and organ diversity. This paper proposes an active learning method to expedite the annotation process for organ segmentation and creates the largest multi-organ dataset (by far) with the spleen, liver, kidneys, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, and IVC annotated in 8,448 CT volumes, equating to 3.2 million slices. The conventional annotation methods would take an experienced annotator up to 1,600 weeks (or roughly 30.8 years) to complete this task. In contrast, our annotation method has accomplished this task in three weeks (based on an 8-hour workday, five days a week) while maintaining a similar or even better annotation quality. This achievement is attributed to three unique properties of our method: (1) label bias reduction using multiple pre-trained segmentation models, (2) effective error detection in the model predictions, and (3) attention guidance for annotators to make corrections on the most salient errors. Furthermore, we summarize the taxonomy of common errors made by AI algorithms and annotators. This allows for continuous revision of both AI and annotations and significantly reduces the annotation costs required to create large-scale datasets for a wider variety of medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Purpose: Intraoperative ultrasound scanning is a demanding visuotactile task. It requires operators to simultaneously localise the ultrasound perspective and manually perform slight adjustments to the pose of the probe, making sure not to apply excessive force or breaking contact with the tissue, whilst also characterising the visible tissue. Method: To analyse the probe-tissue contact, an iterative filtering and topological method is proposed to identify the underlying visible tissue, which can be used to detect acoustic shadow and construct confidence maps of perceptual salience. Results: For evaluation, datasets containing both in vivo and medical phantom data are created. A suite of evaluations is performed, including an evaluation of acoustic shadow classification. Compared to an ablation, deep learning, and statistical method, the proposed approach achieves superior classification on in vivo data, achieving an F_beta score of 0.864, in comparison to 0.838, 0.808, 0.808. A novel framework for evaluating the confidence estimation of probe tissue contact is created. The phantom data is captured specifically for this, and comparison is made against two established methods. The proposed method produced the superior response, achieving an average normalised root mean square error of 0.168, in comparison to 1.836 and 4.542. Evaluation is also extended to determine the algorithm's robustness to parameter perturbation, speckle noise, data distribution shift, and capability for guiding a robotic scan. Conclusion: The results of this comprehensive set of experiments justify the potential clinical value of the proposed algorithm, which can be used to support clinical training and robotic ultrasound automation.

Abstract: The development of efficient segmentation strategies for medical images has evolved from its initial dependence on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the current investigation of hybrid models that combine CNNs with Vision Transformers (ViTs). There is an increasing focus on creating architectures that are both high-performing and computationally efficient, capable of being deployed on remote systems with limited resources. Although transformers can capture global dependencies in the input space, they face challenges from the corresponding high computational and storage expenses involved. This research investigates the integration of CNNs with Vision Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Vision-xLSTM)s by introducing the novel U-VixLSTM.
  The Vision-xLSTM blocks capture the temporal and global relationships within the patches extracted from the CNN feature maps. The convolutional feature reconstruction path upsamples the output volume from the Vision-xLSTM blocks to produce the segmentation output. Our primary objective is to propose that Vision-xLSTM forms an appropriate backbone for medical image segmentation, offering excellent performance with reduced computational costs. The U-VixLSTM exhibits superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art networks in the publicly available Synapse, ISIC and ACDC datasets.

Abstract: Onboard terrain sensing and mapping for safe planetary landings often suffer from missed hazardous features, e.g., small rocks, due to the large observational range and the limited resolution of the obtained terrain data. To this end, this paper develops a novel real-time stochastic terrain mapping algorithm that accounts for topographic uncertainty between the sampled points, or the uncertainty due to the sparse 3D terrain measurements. We introduce a Gaussian digital elevation map that is efficiently constructed using the combination of Delauney triangulation and local Gaussian process regression. The geometric investigation of the lander-terrain interaction is exploited to efficiently evaluate the marginally conservative local slope and roughness while avoiding the costly computation of the local plane. The conservativeness is proved in the paper. The developed real-time uncertainty quantification pipeline enables stochastic landing safety evaluation under challenging operational conditions, such as a large observational range or limited sensor capability, which is a critical stepping stone for the development of predictive guidance algorithms for safe autonomous planetary landing. Detailed reviews on background and related works are also presented.

<title>Physics-Driven Autoregressive State Space Models for Medical Image Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Medical image reconstruction from undersampled acquisitions is an ill-posed problem involving inversion of the imaging operator linking measurement and image domains. Physics-driven (PD) models have gained prominence in reconstruction tasks due to their desirable performance and generalization. These models jointly promote data fidelity and artifact suppression, typically by combining data-consistency mechanisms with learned network modules. Artifact suppression depends on the network's ability to disentangle artifacts from true tissue signals, both of which can exhibit contextual structure across diverse spatial scales. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are strong in capturing local correlations, albeit relatively insensitive to non-local context. While transformers promise to alleviate this limitation, practical implementations frequently involve design compromises to reduce computational cost by balancing local and non-local sensitivity, occasionally resulting in performance comparable to or trailing that of CNNs. To enhance contextual sensitivity without incurring high complexity, we introduce a novel physics-driven autoregressive state-space model (MambaRoll) for medical image reconstruction. In each cascade of its unrolled architecture, MambaRoll employs a physics-driven state-space module (PD-SSM) to aggregate contextual features efficiently at a given spatial scale, and autoregressively predicts finer-scale feature maps conditioned on coarser-scale features to capture multi-scale context. Learning across scales is further enhanced via a deep multi-scale decoding (DMSD) loss tailored to the autoregressive prediction task. Demonstrations on accelerated MRI and sparse-view CT reconstructions show that MambaRoll consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven and physics-driven methods based on CNN, transformer, and SSM backbones.

Abstract: Predicting future brain states is crucial for understanding healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Longitudinal brain MRI registration, a cornerstone for such analyses, has long been limited by its inability to forecast future developments, reliance on extensive dense longitudinal data, and the need to balance registration accuracy with temporal smoothness. In this work, we present \emph{TimeFlow}, a novel framework for longitudinal brain MRI registration that overcomes all these challenges. TimeFlow leverages a U-Net architecture with temporal conditioning inspired by diffusion models, enabling accurate registration using only two images as input and facilitating prospective analyses through future image prediction. Unlike traditional methods, TimeFlow eliminates the demand for explicit smoothness regularizers and dense sequential data while maintaining temporal consistency and continuity. Experimental results highlight its superior performance in both future timepoint prediction and registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, TimeFlow supports novel biological brain aging analyses, effectively differentiating neurodegenerative conditions from healthy aging, all without requiring segmentation, thus avoiding non-trivial annotation and inconsistent segmentation flaws. This framework paves the way for accurate, data-efficient, and annotation-free prospective analyses of brain aging and chronic diseases.

Abstract: Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with millons of deaths each year, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health agencies. While significant progress has been made in the field of heart failure, leading to improved survival rates and improvement of ejection fraction, there remains substantial unmet needs, due to the complexity and multifactorial characteristics. Therefore, we propose a composable strategy framework for assessment and treatment optimization in heart failure. This framework simulates the doctor-patient consultation process and leverages multi-modal algorithms to analyze a range of data, including video, physical examination, text results as well as medical history. By integrating these various data sources, our framework offers a more holistic evaluation and optimized treatment plan for patients. Our results demonstrate that this multi-modal approach outperforms single-modal artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in terms of accuracy in heart failure (HF) prognosis prediction. Through this method, we can further evaluate the impact of various pathological indicators on HF prognosis,providing a more comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Medical image restoration tasks aim to recover high-quality images from degraded observations, exhibiting emergent desires in many clinical scenarios, such as low-dose CT image denoising, MRI super-resolution, and MRI artifact removal. Despite the success achieved by existing deep learning-based restoration methods with sophisticated modules, they struggle with rendering computationally-efficient reconstruction results. Moreover, they usually ignore the reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in medical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight Transformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency domain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer (RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling operations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple inferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM. Additionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial domain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and imaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in the design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging the conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational complexity of naive CA by nearly half. Extensive experimental results in various tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LRformer in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: How can we teach humanoids to climb staircases and sit on chairs using the surrounding environment context? Arguably, the simplest way is to just show them-casually capture a human motion video and feed it to humanoids. We introduce VIDEOMIMIC, a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that mines everyday videos, jointly reconstructs the humans and the environment, and produces whole-body control policies for humanoid robots that perform the corresponding skills. We demonstrate the results of our pipeline on real humanoid robots, showing robust, repeatable contextual control such as staircase ascents and descents, sitting and standing from chairs and benches, as well as other dynamic whole-body skills-all from a single policy, conditioned on the environment and global root commands. VIDEOMIMIC offers a scalable path towards teaching humanoids to operate in diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Dynamic facial emotion is essential for believable AI-generated avatars, yet most systems remain visually static, limiting their use in simulations like virtual training for investigative interviews with abused children. We present a real-time architecture combining Unreal Engine 5 MetaHuman rendering with NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face to generate facial expressions from vocal prosody in photorealistic child avatars. Due to limited TTS options, both avatars were voiced using young adult female models from two systems to better fit character profiles, introducing a voice-age mismatch. This confound may affect audiovisual alignment. We used a two-PC setup to decouple speech generation from GPU-intensive rendering, enabling low-latency interaction in desktop and VR. A between-subjects study (N=70) compared audio+visual vs. visual-only conditions as participants rated emotional clarity, facial realism, and empathy for avatars expressing joy, sadness, and anger. While emotions were generally recognized - especially sadness and joy - anger was harder to detect without audio, highlighting the role of voice in high-arousal expressions. Interestingly, silencing clips improved perceived realism by removing mismatches between voice and animation, especially when tone or age felt incongruent. These results emphasize the importance of audiovisual congruence: mismatched voice undermines expression, while a good match can enhance weaker visuals - posing challenges for emotionally coherent avatars in sensitive contexts.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.23323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets. Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion). Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference efficiency.

Summary:<br /> 
The article addresses the limitations of current conditional autoregressive image generation methods in practical unsupervised image translation. It introduces a novel approach, Softmax Relaxed Quantization, to improve gradient flow and proposes CycleVAR, a method for image-to-image translation using image-conditional visual autoregressive generation. CycleVAR utilizes multi-scale source image tokens as contextual prompts for generating target image tokens, allowing for both serial multi-step and parallel one-step generation modes. Experimental results demonstrate that the parallel one-step mode achieves superior translation quality and faster inference speed in unsupervised scenarios compared to the serial multi-step mode. CycleVAR outperforms previous state-of-the-art unsupervised image translation models like CycleGAN-Turbo in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation, we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

<div> Keywords: CLIP model, anomaly detection, stacked prompts, feature alignment, zero-shot

Summary:<br /><br />
The study focuses on enhancing alignment between text and image features in the CLIP model for zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. They introduce the StackCLIP model, which uses clustered prompts created by stacking semantically analogous categories. This approach aims to improve model generalization by avoiding overfitting to specific training categories.

Abstract: Enhancing the alignment between text and image features in the CLIP model is a critical challenge in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. Recent studies predominantly utilize specific category prompts during pretraining, which can cause overfitting to the training categories and limit model generalization. To address this, we propose a method that transforms category names through multicategory name stacking to create stacked prompts, forming the basis of our StackCLIP model. Our approach introduces two key components. The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module, which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks. Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details, dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information. To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models. Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations mentioned earlier. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/CRISP_SAM2.git.

Summary:  
AFUNet is a new deep learning-based method for reconstructing HDR images from LDR inputs. It decouples the reconstruction process into alignment and fusion subtasks, optimizing them alternately for enhanced performance. The method incorporates spatial correspondence priors and joint constraints to improve alignment and fusion. AFUNet utilizes unfolding to transform the iterative optimization process into an end-to-end trainable network with carefully designed modules. Each iteration of AFUNet includes an Alignment-Fusion Module that alternates between alignment and fusion, ultimately bridging misalignments and exposure differences. Extensive evaluations show that AFUNet outperforms existing methods. <div>

Abstract: Existing learning-based methods effectively reconstruct HDR images from multi-exposure LDR inputs with extended dynamic range and improved detail, but they rely more on empirical design rather than theoretical foundation, which can impact their reliability. To address these limitations, we propose the cross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR reconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks -- alignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving synergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method formulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors across LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems through joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we reimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming the conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with carefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each iteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that alternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel Fusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging misaligned content and exposure discrepancies. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate AFUNet's superior performance, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
MRC-VMap is introduced as an end-to-end neural network designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps at intersections using existing roadside surveillance cameras. The system directly converts multi-directional images into map representations, eliminating the need for separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View conversion steps. By leveraging multiple camera views, MRC-VMap enhances mapping completeness, reduces occlusions, and ensures robust performance under practical constraints. Experimental results on 4,000 intersections in China show that MRC-VMap surpasses current online methods and matches the accuracy of expensive LiDAR-based approaches. This cost-effective solution offers a scalable and efficient option for accurate navigation in autonomous vehicle systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vectorized maps are indispensable for precise navigation and the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. Traditional methods for constructing these maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive, labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections. Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations. This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV) conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000 intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems.

Summary: 
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool in processing various types of inputs, including images and videos. This study focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of MLLMs in analyzing sports videos, specifically tennis videos. The research targets the ability of MLLMs to classify tennis actions and identify them in a sequence within a rally.

As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally. We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including different training methods and even using them together with other traditional models.

Abstract: Food insecurity is a significant social and public health issue that plagues many urban metropolitan areas around the world. Existing approaches to identifying food insecurity rely primarily on qualitative and quantitative survey data, which is difficult to scale. This project seeks to explore the effectiveness of using street-level images in modeling food insecurity at the census tract level. To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature extraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures, interpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study.

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG) and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However, generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods, supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through visual-language alignment.

Summary: 
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in video understanding tasks but struggle with long-form videos due to inefficient perception of temporal intervals. To address this challenge, Temporal Search (TS) is introduced, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal regions iteratively for improved long video understanding. TS operates through two iterative stages: proposing likely task-relevant temporal intervals and refining responses through fine-grained sampling. TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy, further improves efficiency by scoring candidate intervals based on confidence and self-evaluation for optimal exploration. This approach enhances MLLM's understanding of long videos by dynamically adjusting temporal focus and collecting keyframe-level descriptions for cross-interval perception. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally, keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation, and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

Summary: 
This study addresses the challenge of accurately predicting the safety of an autonomous vehicle's future motion in complex and dynamic environments. The researchers propose a novel approach to enhance the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data using a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method. They introduce DriveMRP-10K, a dataset of high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training. Additionally, they design a framework called DriveMRP-Agent, which incorporates a unique information injection strategy to enable VLMs to better understand spatial relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Experimental results show that fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K significantly improves the motion risk prediction performance of VLM baselines and enhances accident recognition accuracy. When tested on a real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, showcasing its potential for real-world autonomous driving scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle, other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to 68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in real-world scenarios.

<div> Keywords: fever screening, infrared thermographs, canthi regions, multi-modal registration, localization

Summary:
Fever screening using infrared thermographs (IRTs) is an effective method for mass screening during infectious disease outbreaks. Canthi regions near the inner eyes are ideal for temperature monitoring. A registration method using IR and white-light images was proposed, achieving an accuracy within 2.7 mm for canthi localization. The method involves a coarse-fine registration strategy with different models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. This approach enables quick and non-invasive detection of elevated temperatures, making it suitable for public places like hospitals and airports during pandemics such as Ebola and SARS. Fever screening based on IRTs is powerful and efficient, with accurate localization of canthi regions being crucial for successful monitoring.

Abstract: Fever screening based on infrared thermographs (IRTs) is a viable mass screening approach during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and SARS, for temperature monitoring in public places like hospitals and airports. IRTs have found to be powerful, quick and non-invasive methods to detect elevated temperatures. Moreover, regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi (called the canthi regions in this paper) are preferred sites for fever screening. Accurate localization of the canthi regions can be achieved through multi-modal registration of infrared (IR) and white-light images. We proposed a registration method through a coarse-fine registration strategy using different registration models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. We evaluated the registration accuracy to be within 2.7 mm, which enables accurate localization of the canthi regions.

<div> architecture, attention, vision-language models, compressed sensing, scalability
<br />
CSAT is a novel architecture for vision-language models that addresses the computational bottleneck of the standard attention mechanism by using compressed sensing techniques. By projecting key and value representations into a lower-dimensional subspace and reconstructing attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. This approach is particularly effective for vLLMs, exploiting the compressibility of visual and textual representations in video and language data. CSAT benefits from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making it well-suited for next-generation multimodal transformers. The formal mathematical treatment of CSAT, integration into vision language pipelines, and validation on standard benchmarks demonstrate its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource-efficient solution.

arXiv:2507.02957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them, leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high, and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks, highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient solution for next generation multimodal transformers.

Abstract: The integration of large-scale circuits and systems emphasizes the importance of automated defect detection of electronic components. The YOLO image detection model has been used to detect PCB defects and it has become a typical AI-assisted case of traditional industrial production. However, conventional detection algorithms have stringent requirements for the angle, orientation, and clarity of target images. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PCB defect detection algorithm, named VR-YOLO, based on the YOLOv8 model. This algorithm aims to improve the model's generalization performance and enhance viewpoint robustness in practical application scenarios. We first propose a diversified scene enhancement (DSE) method by expanding the PCB defect dataset by incorporating diverse scenarios and segmenting samples to improve target diversity. A novel key object focus (KOF) scheme is then presented by considering angular loss and introducing an additional attention mechanism to enhance fine-grained learning of small target features. Experimental results demonstrate that our improved PCB defect detection approach achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 98.9% for the original test images, and 94.7% for the test images with viewpoint shifts (horizontal and vertical shear coefficients of $\pm 0.06$ and rotation angle of $\pm 10$ degrees), showing significant improvements compared to the baseline YOLO model with negligible additional computational cost.

<div> Concept-based adversarial attack, probabilistic generative model, diverse adversarial examples, concept preservation, attack efficiency 

Summary: 
Concept-based adversarial attacks presented in this article extend beyond single-image perturbations by operating on entire concepts using a probabilistic generative model. This method ensures that resulting adversarial images still represent the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from a concept-based adversarial distribution, a diverse range of images is generated, maintaining the original concept while varying in pose, viewpoint, or background to mislead the classifier. The framework is consistent with traditional adversarial attacks mathematically and results in more diverse adversarial examples while effectively preserving the underlying concept. The theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks have higher attack efficiency compared to single-image perturbations. <div>

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept -- represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

This study conducts a comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured beneath the seabed, it evaluates model performance in accurately delineating target structures under challenging visual conditions. The results indicated that YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 in overall performance.

Abstract: Accurate, timely, and farm-level crop type information is paramount for national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and economic planning, particularly in agriculturally significant nations like India. While remote sensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring, existing approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical scalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and heterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification essential for proactive decision-making.
  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for targeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season, multi-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our methodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model successfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly 90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and management across India.

<br />Summary: This study delves into the use of artificial intelligence in creating visual representations of Biblical stories, focusing on Exodus 2:5-9. It examines how AI-generated images, specifically using MidJourney, interpret and reimagine sacred narratives. Through a comparative analysis with traditional artworks and Google images, the research explores the aesthetic, theological, and cultural aspects of AI-generated depictions. The study finds that while AI produces visually appealing and creative images, it also reflects biases present in its training data. The potential of AI to enhance human imagination is recognized, but questions are raised regarding its capability for true creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. The research suggests that AI can be a valuable tool for reinterpretation of Biblical texts but acknowledges the complexities and controversies surrounding its role in sacred art. <div>

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and the visualization of Biblical narratives by analyzing AI-generated images of Exodus 2:5-9 (Moses found in River Nile) using MidJourney. Drawing on the classical concepts of mimesis (imitation) and poiesis (creative generation), the authors investigate how text-to-image (T2I) models reproduce or reimagine sacred narratives. Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results and classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and cultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI excels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also reflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights AI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for genuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. It concludes by suggesting that AI can serve as a creative partner in reinterpreting biblical texts, though its role in sacred art remains complex and contested.

Summary:
In this new study, the authors investigate the spatial reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by developing an evaluation framework focused on spatial deformation reasoning tasks from 2D to 3D. The benchmark they created allows for the generation of unlimited problem pairs for evaluation, without any data leakage. The evaluation involves forward reasoning (operations to final state) and reverse reasoning (final state to operations) in a ladder competition format based on the number of deformation steps. Surprisingly, the results show that most models struggle with spatial deformation reasoning tasks, even after targeted training and reasoning enhancement methods. The findings suggest that current VLMs have limitations in understanding and manipulating spatial objects effectively. <div>

Abstract: Humans naturally possess the spatial reasoning ability to form and manipulate images and structures of objects in space. There is an increasing effort to endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand and manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial deformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial deformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can generate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any data leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial deformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the operations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state, determine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the number of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the goal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning capabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no model demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities. Furthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning enhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial deformation reasoning.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges faced in medical image analysis due to noisy and mislabeled datasets, leading to potential risks in diagnostic predictions. To address these issues, a novel framework called Iterative Misclassification Error Training (IMET) is introduced, combining aspects of curriculum learning and coreset selection. IMET aims to identify misclassified samples, prioritize attention to edge cases and rare outcomes, and streamline the training process. The framework is evaluated on medical image classification datasets using ResNet architectures, showing potential in enhancing model robustness and accuracy. Overall, IMET offers a promising approach to improving deep learning models' performance on challenging medical datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular, could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples, enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However, developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process, while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture for multimodal learning that balances deep fusion and computational scalability. GRF utilizes a linearly scalable, recurrent pipeline that processes modalities sequentially, updating a multimodal context vector at each step. It incorporates a fusion block with Transformer Decoder layers for symmetric cross-attention and a Gated Fusion Unit (GFU) for dynamic information flow control. This design scales linearly with the number of modalities, making it suitable for high-modality environments. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSI benchmark show that GRF performs competitively with more complex baselines. Visualization of the embedding space indicates that GRF creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive fusion mechanism. The approach presented in this paper offers a robust and efficient paradigm for powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit (GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow, enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful, recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

The traditional methods of validation, such as synthetic rendering or robotic testbed acquisition, can be challenging to set up and time-consuming. The proposed approach involves augmenting image datasets in real-time with synthesized views at novel poses, allowing for the creation of continuous trajectories from sparse existing datasets. A new distance metric, the Boresight Deviation Distance, is introduced for measuring the distance between camera poses, which is more suitable for view synthesis compared to existing metrics. This method enables the density of image datasets to be increased efficiently. By utilizing VISY-REVE, researchers can streamline the validation process and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of image processing algorithms for Vision-Based Navigation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion 3.5, has enabled the generation of highly photorealistic synthetic images that pose significant challenges to existing detection methods. This paper presents FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and (3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000 paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic images exhibit distinct spectral signatures in the 0.1--0.4 normalised frequency range, providing theoretical foundation for our approach.

Abstract: Early-stage scoliosis is often difficult to detect, particularly in adolescents, where delayed diagnosis can lead to serious health issues. Traditional X-ray-based methods carry radiation risks and rely heavily on clinical expertise, limiting their use in large-scale screenings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Multi-Instance Learning Network (TG-MILNet) for non-invasive scoliosis detection using gait videos. To handle temporal misalignment in gait sequences, we employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) clustering to segment videos into key gait phases. To focus on the most relevant diagnostic features, we introduce an Inter-Bag Temporal Attention (IBTA) mechanism that highlights critical gait phases. Recognizing the difficulty in identifying borderline cases, we design a Boundary-Aware Model (BAM) to improve sensitivity to subtle spinal deviations. Additionally, we incorporate textual guidance from domain experts and large language models (LLM) to enhance feature representation and improve model interpretability. Experiments on the large-scale Scoliosis1K gait dataset show that TG-MILNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in handling class imbalance and accurately detecting challenging borderline cases.

<div> Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Topological Data Analysis, medical image classification, retinal fundus images, APTOS dataset
<br />
Summary:<br /> 
This study compares Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA) techniques for medical image classification using retinal fundus images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns, while TDA extracts high-level topological signatures using cubical persistent homology. Both methods were evaluated on the APTOS dataset for binary detection and diabetic retinopathy severity grading. XGBoost achieved the best performance for both tasks. Results show that HOG and TDA offer competitive performance, encoding different structural aspects of the images. This study is the first to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on retinal imagery, providing interpretable techniques suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines. <div>

Abstract: We present the first comparative study of two fundamentally distinct feature extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract 26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and 94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent (TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images. This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

Summary:
Performance measures such as stride length and speed transition in athletics can be estimated using computer vision-based approaches. This study explores the use of image processing techniques, such as the probabilistic Hough transform and human pose detection algorithms, to estimate leg joint positions of runners from video sequences. By applying a homography transformation, the system can accurately estimate stride length. Experiments using race videos with different runners showed that the proposed system is a valuable tool for coaching and training purposes. The system's ability to measure and monitor gait parameters of athletes suggests its potential use in enhancing individual performance monitoring and training schedule optimization. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Performance measures such as stride length in athletics and the pace of runners can be estimated using different tricks such as measuring the number of steps divided by the running length or helping with markers printed on the track. Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the gait parameters of athletes.

Summary:<br />
- Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown progress in multimodal reasoning but often focus too much on textual input during inference.
- Analysis of MLLM attention patterns revealed their capability to spontaneously refocus on visual input without explicit guidance.
- The Look-Back approach allows MLLMs to autonomously "look back" at visual information during reasoning, enhancing reasoning and perception capabilities.
- Look-Back eliminates the need for explicit visual guidance or structural constraints in the model.
- Extensive empirical evaluations on various multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Look-Back significantly improves the model's performance in reasoning tasks. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning. Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when, where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: The importance of rapid and accurate histologic analysis of surgical tissue in the operating room has been recognized for over a century. Our standard-of-care intraoperative pathology workflow is based on light microscopy and H\&amp;E histology, which is slow, resource-intensive, and lacks real-time digital imaging capabilities. Here, we present an emerging and innovative method for intraoperative histologic analysis, called Intelligent Histology, that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with stimulated Raman histology (SRH). SRH is a rapid, label-free, digital imaging method for real-time microscopic tumor tissue analysis. SRH generates high-resolution digital images of surgical specimens within seconds, enabling AI-driven tumor histologic analysis, molecular classification, and tumor infiltration detection. We review the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific and clinical studies that have demonstrated the transformative potential of intelligent histology across multiple neurosurgical specialties, including neurosurgical oncology, skull base, spine oncology, pediatric tumors, and periperal nerve tumors. Future directions include the development of AI foundation models through multi-institutional datasets, incorporating clinical and radiologic data for multimodal learning, and predicting patient outcomes. Intelligent histology represents a transformative intraoperative workflow that can reinvent real-time tumor analysis for 21st century neurosurgery.

Summary: 
LATTE is a novel approach for detecting generated images by modeling the evolution of latent embeddings across multiple denoising timesteps. By capturing subtle patterns in the trajectory of latent embeddings, LATTE outperforms existing methods on benchmarks like GenImage and DiffusionFake. The use of a latent-visual feature refinement module and aggregation of latent embeddings into a unified representation contribute to its success. LATTE also excels in cross-generator and cross-dataset settings, showcasing its potential for generated image detection. The code for implementing LATTE is available on GitHub, making it accessible for further research and development. <div>
arXiv:2507.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover, it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent embeddings for generated image detection.

<div> Keywords: hallucination, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), sycophancy, authority bias, psychological taxonomy

Summary:
Hallucination in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is commonly attributed to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where models generate incorrect answers to meet user expectations. This study introduces a psychological taxonomy categorizing VLMs' hallucination behaviors, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency, and authority bias. The AIpsych benchmark is designed to analyze these behaviors, revealing psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Experiments show that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, indicating increasing competence but potential response integrity erosion. A human subject study confirms these findings and identifies key behavioral differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests integrating psychological principles into model evaluation to understand VLM hallucination behaviors better.

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Introduction of a psychological taxonomy categorizing VLMs' hallucination behaviors
- Design of AIpsych benchmark to analyze psychological tendencies in model responses
- Experiment findings show increased model size leads to stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, indicating competence growth but potential response integrity erosion

arXiv:2507.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency, and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark, we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

<div> Keywords: Explainable Boosting Machine, feature engineering, overshooting top, satellite imagery, meteorological applications

Summary:
In this study, the researchers explored the use of Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM) in meteorological applications, specifically for detecting overshooting tops (OTs) in satellite imagery. By combining feature engineering techniques with EBMs, they aimed to create interpretable machine learning algorithms for meteorology. The process involved extracting key features from satellite imagery using mathematical methods, training the EBM model with labeled data, and closely aligning the model with domain scientists' strategies for identifying OTs. The EBM model, developed through a human-machine collaboration, demonstrated high interpretability but lower accuracy compared to more complex approaches. However, it represents a significant step towards building fully interpretable machine learning algorithms for meteorology and other related applications.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning (ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering, to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2 (visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16. Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other meteorological applications.

A new AI-driven web application has been developed to detect Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS) early using hyperspectral imaging. The application utilizes a portable hyperspectral imaging system to scan leaf samples and employs a Genetic Algorithm to select five informative wavelengths critical for discriminating infection status. A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to extract spatial-spectral features, which are classified using various machine learning models, with ensemble classifiers such as Random Forest and AdaBoost achieving the highest accuracy. The trained models are integrated into a web application for real-time classification of hyperspectral leaf images, supporting rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm) critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest, AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics, contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and broader crop applicability.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures, typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics: 99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop yields and strengthening food security.

Summary:
The article introduces a method for analytically determining the rotation of a rigid body under orthographic projection with a fixated camera by tracking a single feature in the image. This method is applicable to any point on the body and provides the same instantaneous rotation rate regardless of the point's location. It is independent of the object's shape and does not require prior scene knowledge. The algorithm can be parallel processed and can differentiate points belonging to different rigid bodies based on their rotation values. The paper includes analytical derivations, simulation results, and real video data demonstrations. <div>
arXiv:2507.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, under orthographic projection and with a camera fixated on a point located on a rigid body, the rotation of that body can be analytically obtained by tracking only one other feature in the image. With some exceptions, any tracked point, regardless of its location on the body, yields the same value of the instantaneous rotation rate.
  The proposed method is independent of the shape of the 3D object and does not require a priori knowledge about the scene. This algorithm is suited for parallel processing and can achieve segmentation of the scene by distinguishing points that do not belong to the same rigid body, simply because they do not produce the same value of the rotation. This paper presents an analytical derivation, simulation results, and results from real video data.

Summary: 
Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL) addresses the challenge of subject variability in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) by re-weighting negative pairs from the same subject to focus on activity-specific information. SICL improves HAR model generalization to new subjects by emphasizing activity features over subject-specific cues. Experimental results on UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and DARai benchmarks show that SICL boosts performance by up to 11% compared to traditional contrastive learning methods. The loss function is versatile, adapting well to different self-supervised methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks. By enhancing the ability of models to learn activity-specific features while mitigating the impact of subject variability, SICL shows promise for improving the effectiveness of self-supervised approaches in HAR tasks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

<div> 3D-awareness, image synthesis, generative models,  image editing, scene context  

Summary:  
This paper introduces a novel conditioning approach for guided image synthesis of multi-object scenes that incorporates 3D-awareness. The proposed method, which can be integrated into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models, allows for camera control and conditioning on explicit 3D geometries. By considering the entire context of a scene, both on and off-screen items, the model can generate plausible and semantically rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, the model is lightweight, requires only a reasonable amount of data for training, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. Additionally, the method enables intuitive and consistent image editing and restyling, such as positioning, rotating, or resizing individual objects within a scene. This integrated approach enhances various image creation workflows and expands the range of applications compared to existing methods. <div>

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result, these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene, i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to previous approaches.

Summary: 
The study investigates encoder redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using multiple vision encoders to enhance visual understanding. The research finds that the performance gains from additional encoders can diminish or lead to degradation, termed encoder redundancy. A new metric, Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR), quantifies each encoder's unique contribution, and the Information Gap (IG) measures the overall disparity in encoder utility. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate significant redundancy in current multi-encoder MLLMs. Certain vision encoders contribute minimally or negatively to the model's performance, highlighting inefficiencies in current designs. The proposed metrics offer valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance, confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.

<div> Keywords: dual-frequency PolSAR images, knowledge distillation network, sample rectification, collaborative classification, statistical-based dynamic sample rectification

Summary: 
The article proposes a Selected Knowledge Distillation Network with Statistical-based Sample Rectification (SKDNet-SSR) for collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images. It addresses the challenges of regional consistency and the effective use of dual-frequency data. The SKDNet-SSR utilizes CNN and ViT as feature extractors, incorporating a Statistical-based Dynamic Sample Rectification (SDSR) module to rectify noisy samples based on the complex Wishart distribution of PolSAR covariance matrices. This improves feature extraction by removing noisy pixels. Additionally, a Dual-Frequency Gate-Selected Distillation (DGSD) module is used to emphasize the advantages of different frequency bands and facilitate complementary learning on dual-frequency data. Experimental results on four dual-frequency PolSAR datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SKDNet-SSR compared to other methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on four measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed SKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.

<div> benchmark, text-to-image, prompt sensitivity, multimodal optimization, model capabilities 

Summary: 
The current benchmarks for text-to-image models may underestimate true generative capabilities due to prompt sensitivity and biases favoring certain models. ConceptMix++ introduces a framework to separate prompt phrasing from visual generation by optimizing prompts iteratively. This approach, incorporating a multimodal optimization pipeline using vision-language model feedback, significantly improves compositional generation and reveals hidden model capabilities. Certain visual concepts like spatial relationships and shapes benefit more from prompt optimization, suggesting underestimation in these categories by existing benchmarks. Optimized prompts show strong transferability across models, indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing. This framework enables fairer comparisons and more accurate assessment of T2I models, highlighting the need to revisit current benchmarking strategies for future development.

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts, potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks systematically underestimate model performance in these categories. Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts, indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models. These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more accurate assessment and insights for future development.

<div> Machine unlearning, selective forget, vision transformer, on-the-fly unlearning, membership inference attack<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />Machine unlearning (MUL) is addressed by Proximal Unlearning Vision Transformer (PUVT), enabling a pre-trained model to forget specific training instances or classes without fine-tuning. PUVT simulates unlearning during training by separating classes in mini-batches into forget and retain sets. The model is optimized to predict only the retain-set, achieving on-the-fly forgetting without performance degradation. Training with learnable keys ensures irreversible information erasure, proven by membership inference attacks. PUVT outperforms fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods across various datasets, architectures, and resolutions. <div>
arXiv:2507.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) refers to the problem of making a pre-trained model selectively forget some training instances or class(es) while retaining performance on the remaining dataset. Existing MUL research involves fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model. We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information, validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.

Summary: 
Molecular property prediction is a crucial task in computational chemistry, with applications in drug discovery and materials science. Traditional methods rely on textual representations like SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous. The MolVision approach integrates molecular structure images and textual descriptions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance prediction accuracy. A benchmark with ten datasets was constructed for classification, regression, and description tasks. Evaluation of nine VLMs in various settings showed that combining visual information with fine-tuning strategies like LoRA improved prediction performance. Results indicate that multimodal fusion boosts generalization across molecular properties, with adaptation of vision encoders for molecular images further enhancing performance. The code and data for MolVision are available at the provided link. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational chemistry with critical applications in drug discovery and materials science. While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance.

Summary:
The study presents a novel weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for inexact 3D models without requiring pose annotations. It introduces a feature space based on foundation features that ensure multi-view consistency and address symmetry ambiguities with a self-supervised triplet loss. A texture-invariant pose refinement technique is also proposed for dense alignment in normalized object coordinates. Extensive evaluations on the ScanNet25k dataset demonstrate superior performance over existing weakly supervised methods, surpassing the supervised ROCA as well. Furthermore, the method showcases exceptional generalization capabilities on the SUN2CAD dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results on 20 novel object categories without prior training. The proposed approach opens up possibilities for inferring 3D scene structures from single images across diverse object categories. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One practical approach to infer 3D scene structure from a single image is to retrieve a closely matching 3D model from a database and align it with the object in the image. Existing methods rely on supervised training with images and pose annotations, which limits them to a narrow set of object categories. To address this, we propose a weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for inexact 3D models that requires no pose annotations and generalizes to unseen categories. Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss. Additionally, we introduce a texture-invariant pose refinement technique that performs dense alignment in normalized object coordinates, estimated through the enhanced feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we introduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where our method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.

- Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a versatile intervention for gastrointestinal lesions.
- Computer-assisted systems enhance procedural precision in ESD, but reliable surgical phase recognition is a bottleneck.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

<div> Keywords: semi-supervised learning, semantic segmentation, open-vocabulary segmentation model, unlabeled images, OOD

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework called SemiOVS, designed to effectively utilize unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) images in real-world scenarios. The framework leverages additional unlabeled images to improve the performance of semi-supervised learners with limited labeled data. By using an open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD images, significant performance gains are achieved compared to existing methods. Experimental results on Pascal VOC and Context datasets show that SemiOVS outperforms PrevMatch and SemiVL methods in a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU improvement, respectively. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in leveraging abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. The code for SemiOVS is available on GitHub for future research and real-world applications.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images) or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution (OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and (2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU, respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/wooseok-shin/SemiOVS

<div> Keywords: Domain Generalization, Multi-modal, Unified Representations, Supervised Disentanglement, Benchmark Datasets

Summary: 
In this paper, the focus is on addressing the challenge of Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG), where models are trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target distributions within the same modality set. The proposed approach leverages Unified Representations to map different paired modalities together, enabling synchronized multi-modal improvements. Additionally, a supervised disentanglement framework separates modal-general and modal-specific information, enhancing the alignment of unified representations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of this method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization. This approach aims to overcome sub-optimal results and randomness during generalization in MMDG, providing a more structured and consistent framework for improving model robustness in unseen or distributionally shifted target domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or distributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source domains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally, we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment of unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.

Summary: <br />
Multi-camera systems are crucial for autonomous vehicles and robotics, but traditional global Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems face challenges with robustness. A new global motion averaging framework is proposed, with a focus on rotation and translation averaging. The rotation averaging uses a hierarchical approach to estimate relative rotations within camera units and compute global rotations. Translation averaging incorporates camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints for robustness. Experiments on large datasets show the system matches or exceeds incremental SfM accuracy while improving efficiency. The framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, making it a robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-camera systems are increasingly vital in the environmental perception of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Their physical configuration offers inherent fixed relative pose constraints that benefit Structure-from-Motion (SfM). However, traditional global SfM systems struggle with robustness due to their optimization framework. We propose a novel global motion averaging framework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled rotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our rotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative rotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit rotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate both camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera positions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and refine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds incremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency. Our framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, establishing itself as a robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications.

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI. This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) - structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

<div> Adaptation, Machine Learning, Unsupervised, Prototype, Pseudo-label<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Domain adaptation in machine learning is crucial for reducing labeling costs, particularly when labeled source domain data is available but access to sensitive target domain information is restricted. Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses this issue by enabling adaptation without target domain labels. Challenges in SFUDA include low-quality prototype samples and incorrect pseudo-label assignments. The proposed method addresses these challenges through three phases: utilizing a Reliable Sample Memory module to improve prototype quality, implementing Multi-View Contrastive Learning to enhance pseudo-label accuracy, and applying noisy label filtering for further refinement. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. <div>
arXiv:2507.03321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information, such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA), which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases. In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017, Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art approaches, respectively.

It comprises MIMO-Core, a hierarchical multi-modal agent system, and MIMO-Loop, a coordination loop that enhances design quality through exploration and iteration. By simply providing a natural language prompt and logo image, MIMO can detect and correct errors during the generation process.

arXiv:2507.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent generative models such as GPT-4o have shown strong capabilities in producing high-quality images with accurate text rendering. However, commercial design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more. In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality. Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input, MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing diffusion and LLM-based baselines in real-world banner design scenarios.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets, dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field. However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent privacy protection.

<title>DESign: Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution and Efficient Subnet Regularization for Continuous Sign Language Recognition</title>

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets (i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Be the Change You Want to See: Revisiting Remote Sensing Change Detection Practices</title>

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years, newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that, we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

<title>MRC-DETR: An Adaptive Multi-Residual Coupled Transformer for Bare Board PCB Defect Detection</title>

Abstract: In modern electronic manufacturing, defect detection on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) plays a critical role in ensuring product yield and maintaining the reliability of downstream assembly processes. However, existing methods often suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and insufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that hinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and efficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built upon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation capability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This module improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual structure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture fine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational power of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy caused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive Screening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and aggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level semantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant computations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection accuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data, particularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality dataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources. Our dataset not only supports the training and evaluation of our proposed framework but also serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

<title>Masked Temporal Interpolation Diffusion for Procedure Planning in Instructional Videos</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features, thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally, we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on most metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/WiserZhou/MTID.

Abstract: Estimating normals for noisy point clouds is a persistent challenge in 3D geometry processing, particularly for end-to-end oriented normal estimation. Existing methods generally address relatively clean data and rely on supervised priors to fit local surfaces within specific neighborhoods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through local gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto the underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an implicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a distance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which integrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an implicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding projection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of over-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient consistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and point cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/LeoQLi/LGSF.

<title>Pose-Star: Anatomy-Aware Editing for Open-World Fashion Images</title>

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility (coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star, a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest, etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics (Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

<title>Rectifying Adversarial Sample with Low Entropy Prior for Test-Time Defense</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03427</link>

Abstract: Existing defense methods fail to defend against unknown attacks and thus raise generalization issue of adversarial robustness. To remedy this problem, we attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various attacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low entropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on the universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is elaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower entropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark contrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct existing test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach: Rectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial rectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with clean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified with low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating their adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly classified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward minimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization scheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware weighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy objectives. Experiments on several datasets show that REAL can greatly improve the performance of existing sample rectification models.

<title>Unlearning the Noisy Correspondence Makes CLIP More Robust</title>

Abstract: The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC) samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs. Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information, which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks. Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon acceptance.

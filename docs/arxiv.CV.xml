<div> deep learning, underwater object detection, sonar simulation, template matching, autonomous underwater vehicles

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges of underwater 3D object detection due to the scarcity of training data. Traditional approaches struggle in the harsh acoustic environment, leading to the development of new paradigms for training-free detection. The study introduces a dual approach that combines a physics-based sonar simulation pipeline generating synthetic training data for neural networks and a model-based template matching system utilizing geometric priors of target objects. While neural networks trained on synthetic data show high performance in simulated scenes, they suffer from domain shift on real sonar data. In contrast, the template matching approach achieves impressive results on real data without the need for training, showcasing robustness to acoustic noise and environmental variations. This research challenges the notion of data-heavy deep learning in underwater scenarios and establishes a benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection, opening up possibilities for applications in autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift. Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols, MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of 98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real world.

<div> Keywords: Vision Language Models, multimodal grounding, factual knowledge, internal states, probes

Summary: 
Vision Language Models (VLMs) show a deficiency in their ability to link factual knowledge with visual representations of entities, leading to reduced accuracy in recalling information from visual references. By analyzing internal model states, probes are able to predict unreliable responses with over 92% accuracy. These probes can be used to identify cases where a VLM will fail to correctly answer questions based on multimodal input. Integrating these probes into a visual question answering task increases coverage by 7.87% and reduces the risk of error by 0.9%. Addressing this systematic deficiency in language grounding is crucial for improving the performance of VLMs in understanding and generating responses based on both textual and visual information. Future research should focus on enhancing the multimodal grounding capabilities of VLMs to bridge the gap between textual and visual representations for more accurate and reliable performance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic, detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we provide informed recommendations for future directions.

<div> semantic-aware neural reconstruction, 3D high-fidelity models, sparse images, radiance ambiguity, patch-based semantic logits

Summary:
The article introduces a novel semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate high-fidelity 3D models from sparse images. The method addresses the issue of radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input by enriching neural implicit representations with patch-based semantic logits. A new regularization technique based on geometric primitive masks is also proposed to reduce shape ambiguity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing significant reductions in average chamfer distances on the DTU dataset for SparseNeuS and VolRecon. When used as a plugin for dense reconstruction baselines like NeuS and Neuralangelo, the method achieves substantial improvements in accuracy on the DTU dataset. <div>

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and 68% respectively.

<div> Keywords: illegal landfill, deep learning, AerialWaste dataset, lightweight models, ensemble model

Summary: 
Illegal landfills pose a significant hazard worldwide, with their identification being a challenge due to manual efforts. Deep learning offers a solution by efficiently identifying these landfills, saving time and resources. The AerialWaste dataset, containing images from the Lombardy region of Italy, provides high-quality data for research on illegal landfill detection. Lightweight models like Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, and Densenet were found to be effective in detecting landfills without overfitting. By combining the best performing models into an ensemble model, binary classification on the dataset achieved high accuracy of 92.33%, precision of 92.67%, sensitivity of 92.33%, F1 score of 92.41%, and specificity of 92.71%. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning and lightweight models in efficiently detecting illegal landfills, improving overall performance and accuracy. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources. Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However, AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns. Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet, MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67% precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

<div> graph construction, multimodal fusion, semantic grounding, contrastive learning, sentiment analysis  
Summary:  
The article introduces a novel framework, the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU), for multimodal sentiment analysis that effectively integrates text, acoustic, and visual modalities. SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs using linguistic syntax for text and a text-guided attention mechanism for acoustic and visual modalities to capture detailed intra-modal relationships and semantic interactions. It also introduces a semantic anchor to align heterogeneous semantic spaces across modalities. A multiview contrastive learning objective is developed to promote discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence. SSU achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI while reducing computational overhead. Qualitative analyses confirm SSU's interpretability and ability to capture nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU), which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations. Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

Summary:<br />
FastAvatar is a novel framework that efficiently generates pose-invariant 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from a single face image in milliseconds. It utilizes an encoder-decoder neural network architecture to create a 3DGS face template model from a training dataset, encoding input face images into a pose-invariant embedding for accurate reconstruction. By predicting residuals within a feed-forward process, FastAvatar achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to existing methods like GAGAvatar, while running 1000 times faster than optimization-based techniques like FlashAvatar. Its unique latent space design enables real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing, broadening the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in consumer and interactive systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face ``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures. Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion, model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g., FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in consumer and interactive systems.

Summary:
A new mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template protection scheme has been developed to address the risks associated with using biometrics in humanitarian and emergency scenarios. The system meets functional, operational, security, and privacy requirements specific to vulnerable contexts. PolyProtect, a method working with neural network face embeddings, is identified as the most suitable due to its effectiveness and lightweight computational burden. The system's evaluation on real-world face data from a project in Ethiopia shows promising results for verification, identification accuracy, irreversibility, and unlinkability. Additionally, PolyProtect is tested with fingerprints, showcasing its modality-independence. This evaluation marks the first time PolyProtect has been assessed for identification scenarios and fingerprint biometrics. Further research and code release are planned. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness, modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia. Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan to release our code

<div> relational competence, dynamic relational graphs, multimodal corpora, human activity recognition, spatio-temporal relations
Summary:<br /><br />Vision foundation models (FMs) in computer vision have limitations in tasks requiring entity reasoning, spatio-temporal relations. Next-gen FMs should incorporate dynamic relational graphs for improved semantic fidelity, robustness, interpretability, efficiency. Evidence from human manipulation action recognition, brain tumor segmentation supports this approach. Lightweight graph-reasoning modules enhance performance and out-of-distribution robustness. Hybrid models achieve memory and hardware efficiency, suitable for resource-constrained deployment. Research agenda focuses on dynamic graph construction, multi-level relational reasoning, cross-modal fusion, and evaluating relational competence in structured vision tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces, instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness, interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines. Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Summary:
A new dataset, the LPLC dataset, containing 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687 annotated license plates (LPs) for legibility classification has been introduced for research in Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR). The dataset includes various vehicle types, lighting conditions, and image quality levels. It features fine-grained annotations for vehicle and LP occlusions, four legibility categories, and character labels. A benchmark classification task using three image recognition networks (ViT, ResNet, YOLO) was conducted to determine if an LP image is good, needs super-resolution, or is illegible. Results showed F1 scores below 80% for all models, indicating the difficulty of the task. The study emphasizes the importance of further research in improving ALPR for illegible LPs. The dataset is publicly available for further research on GitHub. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.18425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687 annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO), together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The proposed dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

arXiv:2508.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering (VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an 18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI systems.

<div> Keywords: anomaly detection, surveillance footage, context-aware, zero-shot, spatiotemporal dynamics <br />
Summary: <br />
This article presents a novel framework for context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection in surveillance footage, addressing the challenge of detecting unpredictable anomalies without prior exposure during training. The framework combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to capture spatiotemporal dynamics and semantic context.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance.

Summary:<br />
DoGFlow introduces a self-supervised framework for accurate 3D scene flow estimation without manual annotations. By leveraging radar Doppler measurements, it computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time and transfers them to the LiDAR domain, achieving superior performance on the MAN TruckScenes dataset. The dynamic-aware association and ambiguity-resolved propagation techniques improve label efficiency, enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve over 90% of fully supervised performance using only 10% of ground truth data. This novel approach addresses the challenge of long-range and adverse weather scenarios, outperforming existing self-supervised methods in autonomous navigation systems.

arXiv:2508.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale, manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth data.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces SatSkylines, a novel approach for generating 3D buildings using satellite images and coarse geometric priors. Existing methods struggle to accurately reconstruct building structures from top-down satellite views without proper geometric guidance. To overcome this limitation, SatSkylines models the transformation from coarse priors to detailed geometries, enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. The researchers have created the Skylines-50K dataset, containing over 50,000 unique and stylized 3D building assets to support detailed building model generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and its strong generalization ability across various scenarios. <div>

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone. On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries, enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000 unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of our model and strong generalization ability.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a new research focus on the detection of traversable Spatial Transition Points (STPs) in complex 3D game environments. The task involves identifying the Main STP (MSTP), which lies on the critical path towards the player's macro-objective. A two-stage deep-learning pipeline is proposed, utilizing Faster R-CNN for STP detection and a lightweight MSTP selector for ranking. The study highlights the trade-off between full-network fine-tuning and adapter-only transfer, where the latter proves more effective in low-data scenarios. The research aims to establish baseline performance metrics for future AI-driven navigation aids and level-design tools. The experiments conducted on a diverse dataset from Action RPG titles showcase the feasibility of the proposed approach and offer insights into efficient model adaptation. This work contributes to the advancement of AI-driven map cue presentation and client-side auto-mapping in complex game environments.

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective, from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step. Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built, diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan. Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions. Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel framework called DeReF for cancer survival analysis by integrating information from diverse medical modalities. Existing methods face challenges of fixed fusion schemes and limited information interaction among decoupled features. DeReF addresses these challenges by introducing a random feature reorganization strategy to enhance feature combinations and diversity. It also incorporates a regional cross-attention network to improve the representation quality of decoupled features. Experimental results on Liver Cancer and TCGA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DeReF in improving feature fusion and prediction accuracy. The proposed approach shows promise for improving survival-time predictions in cancer research.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based (Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

Summary:
ROSE (Remove Objects with Side Effects) addresses the challenge of eliminating side effects such as shadows and reflections when removing objects from videos. The framework categorizes the effects into five common cases and uses a 3D rendering engine for generating synthetic data due to the scarcity of paired video data for supervision. A fully automatic pipeline is constructed for data preparation, creating a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes and objects. ROSE, implemented as a video inpainting model based on diffusion transformer, localizes object-correlated areas in the video for reference-based erasing. Additional supervision is introduced to predict areas affected by side effects, improving performance. The ROSE-Bench benchmark evaluates the model's performance on various side effect removal scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods and generalizability to real-world video situations. <div>
arXiv:2508.18633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision. This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes, objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

Summary:
The paper introduces solutions to address the motion-detail imbalance in video captioning. It constructs the HMD-270K dataset through Motion-Detail Fusion and Fine-Grained Examination and introduces the Caption Set Equivalence Reward based on Group Relative Policy Optimization to enhance completeness and accuracy in capturing motion and details. The OwlCap model, developed using supervised fine-tuning and post-training with CSER, achieves significant improvements on VDC and DREAM-1K benchmarks. The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap model will be publicly released to advance video captioning research. <div>
arXiv:2508.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2) Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER) based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance. Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2 Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks, particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference, and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT) bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB, EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and 0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in underwater scenes.

Summary: 
The Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network is proposed for automated left ventricular endocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos to improve EF estimation accuracy. The network utilizes a hierarchical design incorporating convolutional networks for single-frame image processing and the Mamba architecture for capturing spatio-temporal relationships. The Spatio-temporal Cross Scan module is introduced to integrate long-range context across frames and positions, addressing limitations of local spatio-temporal processing and helping mitigate biases in EF calculation.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network (\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception. The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details, while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

New unsupervised domain adaptation method, Feature-space Planes Searcher (FPS), optimizes decision boundaries using geometric patterns in feature space from pre-trained models. This approach retains interpretability, scalability, and efficiency while reducing memory and computational costs. FPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in public benchmarks, scaling efficiently with large models and across various domains like protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake detection. By leveraging discriminative structures and preserving transferable geometric patterns, FPS provides a simple, effective, and generalizable paradigm for domain adaptation tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors - an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation tasks. .

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies, sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges, including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA) is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination, demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model (EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior 3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes, leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization, an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better overall generalization.

<div> Curriculum Learning, Sharpness-Aware Minimization, Adversarial Difficulty Measure, Neural Networks, Generalization<br />
Summary:<br />
Neural networks trained using empirical risk minimization often suffer from overfitting, leading to poor generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) tackles this issue by selecting training samples based on difficulty, while Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) aims to find flat minima for improved robustness. However, combining CL and SAM poses challenges due to difficulty in evaluating sample difficulty in flat regions. To address this, the proposed Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM) leverages robustness properties of models trained towards flat minima to quantify adversarial vulnerability. By incorporating ADM into CL-based training with SAM, sample difficulty can be dynamically assessed. Evaluation on image classification tasks, fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization demonstrates that the method surpasses existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies, preserving the strengths of both CL and SAM. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective, methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks, fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

<div> scallops, underwater object detection, imbalanced class distribution, localization analysis, classification experiments 

Summary:
Underwater object detection in marine ecosystems faces challenges such as degraded image quality and imbalanced class distribution. The study focuses on understanding the performance disparities in detecting marine species, particularly scallops. The research investigates factors beyond data quantity influencing class-specific performance disparities and proposes systematic improvements for under-performing marine species. Results from the DUO dataset manipulation reveal that foreground-background discrimination is a crucial challenge in object localization. Despite balanced data, precision gaps persist in classification, indicating intrinsic feature-based challenges. The study recommends imbalanced distributions for prioritizing precision and balanced distributions for recall. To enhance under-performing classes, the focus should be on algorithmic advancements, particularly within localization modules. The release of code and datasets promotes further research in underwater object detection.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules. We publicly release our code and datasets.

Summary:
Drawing2CAD introduces a new framework for automatically generating parametric CAD models from 2D vector drawings. This approach reframes CAD generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem, utilizing vector drawing primitives to inform the generation of CAD operations. The framework includes a network-friendly vector primitive representation, a dual-decoder transformer architecture, and a soft target distribution loss function. The CAD-VGDrawing dataset is created for training and evaluation purposes. Thorough experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Drawing2CAD in preserving geometric precision and design intent throughout the transformation process.

arXiv:2508.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds, meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings. The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence, and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing, a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

<div> Keywords: audio-visual speech recognition, noisy environments, feature fusion, cross-modal, robustness

Summary: 
The article presents a novel framework for robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments. Existing systems often struggle to estimate audio reliability and adjust modality reliance effectively. The proposed approach, called router-gated cross-modal feature fusion, dynamically reweights audio and visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. By incorporating an audio-visual feature fusion-based router, the method is able to down-weight unreliable audio tokens and enhance visual cues through gated cross-attention in each decoder layer. This adaptive reweighting mechanism allows the model to prioritize visual cues when audio quality is compromised. Experimental results on the LRS3 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in word error rate compared to existing methods. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of both the router and gating mechanism in enhancing robustness in real-world noisy conditions.

We propose router-gated cross-modal feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

<div> Keywords: human-object interaction detection, vision-language models, benchmark, multiple-answer multiple-choice task, evaluation protocol

Summary: 
The article discusses the integration of early vision-language models (VLMs) in human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods and proposes a new benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of standalone VLMs in solving HOI detection tasks. Existing HOI benchmarks are not suitable for evaluating VLMs due to their exact matching evaluation protocols. The new benchmark formulates HOI detection as a multiple-answer multiple-choice task, reducing ambiguity in annotations and allowing for valid predictions to be recognized. By reshaping the evaluation process, the benchmark enables direct comparison between general-purpose VLMs and specialized HOI methods, providing new insights into the current state of progress in HOI understanding.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized, affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing" is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current state of progress in HOI understanding.

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options. Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring, offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare and human-computer interaction applications.

Summary:<br />
Effective waste sorting is crucial for sustainable recycling, but AI research in this area lags due to limited datasets and reliance on old object detectors. The study introduces a semi-supervised learning framework for waste detection using ensemble models. Benchmarking OVOD models on the ZeroWaste dataset shows LLM-optimized prompts enhance zero-shot accuracy. Modern transformer-based detectors achieve a new baseline of 51.6 mAP after fine-tuning to address domain-specific limitations. A soft pseudo-labeling strategy, combining ensemble predictions with weighting, boosts performance on the ZeroWaste-s subset beyond fully supervised training. The study contributes by establishing baselines, introducing a robust pseudo-labeling pipeline, creating annotations for the ZeroWaste-s subset, and evaluating OVOD models under real-world waste sorting conditions.

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy. Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models under real-world waste sorting conditions.

Summary:
Different font styles convey distinct impressions, showing a strong relationship between font shapes and the impression tags used to describe them. A novel embedding method is proposed in this paper that capitalizes on these shape-impression relationships. By assigning similar vectors to frequently co-occurring impression tags, the method effectively represents font impressions. Comparing this method to standard word embedding models like BERT and CLIP, it proves superior in impression-guided font generation. The approach involves constructing a graph representing impression tags and utilizing spectral embedding to generate impression vectors for each tag. The method demonstrates better performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness in impression-based font generation and retrieval. Essentially, the novel embedding method captures the nuances of font impressions, allowing for more accurate representation and manipulation in font-related tasks. <div>

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions, indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval. Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

<div> Keywords: National Forest Inventory, remote sensing, machine learning, deep learning, tree species classification

Summary:
Using remote sensing and machine learning, this study explores how deep features from pre-trained models can enhance tree species classification accuracy in the Netherlands with limited labeled data. By leveraging data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ERA5 satellites, and SRTM using Google Earth Engine, the researchers fine-tuned a remote sensing model and outperformed traditional methods by up to 10%. The results suggest that utilizing deep AI features from pre-trained models improves NFI classification accuracy significantly, highlighting the inadequacy of traditional hand-designed features for this task. The study demonstrates the potential of integrating deep learning techniques with remote sensing data to update NFIs more efficiently and at larger scales. This approach offers a promising strategy to complement existing forest inventory processes and improve the accuracy of tree species distribution data for better forest management. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However, maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns. Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning, offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise, we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

<div> Keywords: Micro-expressions, video-level regression, interval selection, prior guidance, performance improvement

Summary: 
In this paper, a novel method for analyzing micro-expressions (MEs) is introduced. Traditional ME analysis methods often struggle to capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs due to fixed window sizes and hard decisions. The proposed method utilizes a prior-guided video-level regression approach that considers the temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs. A scalable interval selection strategy is implemented to accurately spot the onset, apex, and offset phases of MEs. Additionally, a synergistic optimization framework is employed, allowing the model to efficiently utilize limited data and enhance its capabilities by sharing parameters between spotting and recognition tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets showcase the state-of-the-art performance of the method, achieving an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)3 and 0.2000 on SAMMLV.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges, interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods, leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs, enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition, we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV.

Summary: 
This study focuses on the objective assessment of microsurgical anastomoses using image-processing techniques. Traditional methods of evaluation rely on subjective judgment, leading to biases that can affect accuracy. By leveraging three hospital datasets, the researchers developed a quantitative framework that includes geometric modeling of errors and a scoring mechanism to enhance proficiency assessment.

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel method for improving pixel-level synthesis video stabilization by rapidly adapting models to each input video at test time. This approach leverages low-level visual cues during inference to enhance both stability and visual quality of the output, achieving significant performance gains even with just a single adaptation pass. The method includes a jerk localization module and targeted adaptation strategy, focusing on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation steps. By enabling modern stabilizers to outperform previous state-of-the-art methods while maintaining full-frame synthesis, users are provided with control mechanisms similar to classical approaches. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of this approach, consistently enhancing the performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and quantitative terms, including downstream applications. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision, particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

<div> framework, fairness, medical imaging, multimodal prompt-learning, debiasing
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces DualFairVL, a framework designed to ensure fairness in medical imaging diagnosis across different demographic groups. It addresses the challenge of cross-modal misalignment and fairness gaps by jointly debiasing and aligning visual and text modalities. DualFairVL uses a dual-branch architecture to disentangle sensitive and target attributes and generate aligned representations. It incorporates orthogonal text anchors and a hypernetwork to encode dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features. Experimental results on various medical imaging datasets demonstrate that DualFairVL outperforms existing baselines in terms of fairness and accuracy, even with a smaller number of trainable parameters. The code for DualFairVL will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, focusing on enhancing object and interaction queries for improved detection accuracy. The proposed method enhances object queries with object-aware encoder features to better capture interactions between humans and objects.

The source code for DQEN is publicly available on GitHub for reproducibility and further research advancements.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable. Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features. Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/lzzhhh1019/DQEN.

Trustworthy AI is crucial for autonomous vehicles' widespread deployment. End-to-end approaches face challenges in interpreting decisions, especially in complex urban settings due to deep neural networks' non-linear boundaries. This paper introduces a method to improve interpretability and optimize control commands in autonomous driving. The proposed loss functions enhance model interpretability by generating sparse and localized feature maps, helping explain the image regions influencing control commands. Ablation studies on feature extraction validate the method on CARLA benchmarks, showing improved interpretability leading to reduced infractions and safer driving. The monocular, non-ensemble model outperforms top-performing approaches on the CARLA Leaderboard, achieving lower infractions and higher route completion rates while ensuring interpretability. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks: Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval. A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility. The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia 2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural archiving, and accessibility.

Summary:
This study introduces a framework for distinguishing between group and single pedestrians using real-world trajectory data. A Transformer-based pair classification model is employed to identify cohesive groups and isolate single pedestrians. Spatial utilization metrics such as convex hull area and smallest enclosing circle radius are used to characterize how different pedestrian types occupy space. Behavioral metrics like velocity change and trajectory straightness capture local adaptations during interactions. A typology of encounter types-single-to-single, single-to-group, and group-to-group-is introduced to categorize interaction scenarios. The study establishes a comprehensive metric framework for deeper analysis and paves the way for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths. Future versions will focus on complete quantitative analysis of the metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space design validation in crowd dynamics research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process. To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change, motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single, single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200 frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Summary:
This study addresses the challenge of monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales using drone-based aerial imagery. The limited resolution of drone imagery makes it difficult to distinguish fine-scale classes, such as coral morphotypes, without costly and labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. The proposed multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework transfers fine-scale ecological information from underwater imagery to aerial data, enabling large-scale coral reef mapping with minimal manual annotation. By combining classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation, and self-distillation techniques, the method allows for large-area segmentation of coral morphotypes and flexibility for integrating new classes. This approach offers a cost-effective and scalable methodology for high-resolution reef monitoring by combining low-cost data collection, weakly supervised deep learning, and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge, essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts. While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems (GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles, specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity, whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject consistency and style similarity.

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently, NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants - text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR - across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the "concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications, understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age, and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

<title>RoofSeg: An edge-aware transformer-based network for end-to-end roof plane segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19003</link>

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low, leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network, named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module (EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition, we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss to constrain the network training.

<title>MicroDetect-Net (MDN): Leveraging Deep Learning to Detect Microplastics in Clam Blood, a Step Towards Human Blood Analysis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19021</link>

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly, microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of 90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

<title>ProPy: Building Interactive Prompt Pyramids upon CLIP for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events, ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels, and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous models by significant margins. Code is available at https://github.com/BUAAPY/ProPy.

<title>GReAT: leveraging geometric artery data to improve wall shear stress assessment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high (time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

<title>No Label Left Behind: A Unified Surface Defect Detection Model for all Supervision Regimes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19060</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability. Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial applications.

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy. We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly undersampled regimes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast, we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection over event-based sensing without motion induction.

<title>Few-Shot Connectivity-Aware Text Line Segmentation in Historical Documents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200% increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/RafaelSterzinger/acpr_few_shot_hist.

<title>Dual Enhancement on 3D Vision-Language Perception for Monocular 3D Visual Grounding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19165</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information. Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods. Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE), which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries. Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly available.

<title>Beyond flattening: a geometrically principled positional encoding for vision transformers with Weierstrass elliptic functions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19167</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19167</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively. We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including 63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture, 93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: The SoccerNet 2025 Challenges mark the fifth annual edition of the SoccerNet open benchmarking effort, dedicated to advancing computer vision research in football video understanding. This year's challenges span four vision-based tasks: (1) Team Ball Action Spotting, focused on detecting ball-related actions in football broadcasts and assigning actions to teams; (2) Monocular Depth Estimation, targeting the recovery of scene geometry from single-camera broadcast clips through relative depth estimation for each pixel; (3) Multi-View Foul Recognition, requiring the analysis of multiple synchronized camera views to classify fouls and their severity; and (4) Game State Reconstruction, aimed at localizing and identifying all players from a broadcast video to reconstruct the game state on a 2D top-view of the field. Across all tasks, participants were provided with large-scale annotated datasets, unified evaluation protocols, and strong baselines as starting points. This report presents the results of each challenge, highlights the top-performing solutions, and provides insights into the progress made by the community. The SoccerNet Challenges continue to serve as a driving force for reproducible, open research at the intersection of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and sports.

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer. Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality, we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than 8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

<title>All-in-One Slider for Attribute Manipulation in Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.19195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces. Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules. However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes. Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at: https://github.com/ywxsuperstar/KSAE-FaceSteer.

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent 3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects. Homepage: \href{https://omnihuman-lab.github.io/v1_5/}

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking (VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78, $\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth, lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation. Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS 2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster training on 16-frame sequences.

Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes. Project page: https://becky-catherine.github.io/Style4D .

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model, allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh. Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing approaches.

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data foundation for in-context 3D generation.

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging (DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics, scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However, these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm 0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm 0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties, showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) systems like Microsoft HoloLens 2 hold promise for arm's distance guidance (e.g., surgery), but depth perception of the hologram and occlusion of real instruments remain challenging. We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with different transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real tool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten participants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we compared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth matching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a simulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six visualization conditions ($2 \times 3$: two target transparencies and three tool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool tracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization error, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show that a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error than a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real tool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability with the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst performance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent, while allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues and did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion cues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real time, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers of arm-distance AR systems should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion handling; if unavailable, cautiously use transparency to balance depth perception and tool visibility.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove private or sensitive data from a pre-trained model while preserving the model's robustness. Despite recent advances, this technique has not been explored in medical image classification. This work evaluates the SalUn unlearning model by conducting experiments on the PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and BloodMNIST datasets. We also analyse the impact of data augmentation on the quality of unlearning. Results show that SalUn achieves performance close to full retraining, indicating an efficient solution for use in medical applications.

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation, single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

The images used for training and validation of the models were obtained from specialized platforms. Some techniques were used to adjust the evaluation metrics of the neural networks. The results found suggest the model Inception v3 as a valuable tool for supporting the diagnosis of psoriasis. This is due to its satisfactory performance with respect to accuracy and F1-Score (97.5% ${\pm}$ 0.2).

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores, with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases; we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent, realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains, which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain. Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence. Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend, in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code and annotations are available.

<title>Natural Image Classification via Quasi-Cyclic Graph Ensembles and Random-Bond Ising Models at the Nishimori Temperature</title>

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification. High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC (MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers, bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates $\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction, achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and -100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve 98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Stabilizing Open-Set Test-Time Adaptation via Primary-Auxiliary Filtering and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However, the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP), which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at: https://github.com/GabrielleTse/EMind.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME) analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA) strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However, these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content, compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users. Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangrui4041/Hidden_Tail.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness, model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes (gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit, highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum circuits for fractal Julia image generation posits a unique direction of future research where it can be applied to quantum generative arts across various ecosystems with a customised approach, such as producing an exciting landscape based on a quantum art theme.

Recently, sharpness-aware minimization has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency. However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual \textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches.

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis. Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our experiments.

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance (TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat, selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF and Dynamic APPATT algorithms.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing \textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically for this task.

<title>Time Series Analysis of Spiking Neural Systems via Transfer Entropy and Directed Persistent Homology</title>

Abstract: We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and dimensions.
  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution (ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of 18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs, consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution. To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art methods, constantly reaching the final goal.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis. However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g., close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight image quality improvements.

<title>RDDM: Practicing RAW Domain Diffusion Model for Real-world Image Restoration</title>

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data. While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

<title>MemoryVLA: Perceptual-Cognitive Memory in Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

Abstract: Online stereo adaptation tackles the domain shift problem, caused by different environments between synthetic (training) and real (test) datasets, to promptly adapt stereo models in dynamic real-world applications such as autonomous driving. However, previous methods often fail to counteract particular regions related to dynamic objects with more severe environmental changes. To mitigate this issue, we propose to incorporate an auxiliary point-selective network into a meta-learning framework, called PointFix, to provide a robust initialization of stereo models for online stereo adaptation. In a nutshell, our auxiliary network learns to fix local variants intensively by effectively back-propagating local information through the meta-gradient for the robust initialization of the baseline model. This network is model-agnostic, so can be used in any kind of architectures in a plug-and-play manner. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method under three adaptation settings such as short-, mid-, and long-term sequences. Experimental results show that the proper initialization of the base stereo model by the auxiliary network enables our learning paradigm to achieve state-of-the-art performance at inference.

Abstract: In this study, we aim to enhance the capabilities of diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation models by integrating diverse modalities beyond textual descriptions within a unified framework. To this end, we categorize widely used conditional inputs into three modality types: structure, layout, and attribute. We propose a multimodal T2I diffusion model, which is capable of processing all three modalities within a single architecture without modifying the parameters of the pre-trained diffusion model, as only a small subset of components is updated. Our approach sets new benchmarks in multimodal generation through extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons with existing conditional generation methods. We demonstrate that DiffBlender effectively integrates multiple sources of information and supports diverse applications in detailed image synthesis. The code and demo are available at https://github.com/sungnyun/diffblender.

Abstract: Image restoration is a low-level vision task, most CNN methods are designed as a black box, lacking transparency and internal aesthetics. Although some methods combining traditional optimization algorithms with DNNs have been proposed, they all have some limitations. In this paper, we propose a three-granularity memory layer and contrast learning named MemoryNet, specifically, dividing the samples into positive, negative, and actual three samples for contrastive learning, where the memory layer is able to preserve the deep features of the image and the contrastive learning converges the learned features to balance. Experiments on Derain/Deshadow/Deblur task demonstrate that these methods are effective in improving restoration performance. In addition, this paper's model obtains significant PSNR, SSIM gain on three datasets with different degradation types, which is a strong proof that the recovered images are perceptually realistic.

Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM), an advanced universal image segmentation model trained on an expansive visual dataset, has set a new benchmark in image segmentation and computer vision. However, it faced challenges when it came to distinguishing between shadows and their backgrounds. To address this, we developed Deshadow-Anything, considering the generalization of large-scale datasets, and we performed Fine-tuning on large-scale datasets to achieve image shadow removal. The diffusion model can diffuse along the edges and textures of an image, helping to remove shadows while preserving the details of the image. Furthermore, we design Multi-Self-Attention Guidance (MSAG) and adaptive input perturbation (DDPM-AIP) to accelerate the iterative training speed of diffusion. Experiments on shadow removal tasks demonstrate that these methods can effectively improve image restoration performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing technology has become a promising tool in yield prediction. Most prior work employs satellite imagery for county-level corn yield prediction by spatially aggregating all pixels within a county into a single value, potentially overlooking the detailed information and valuable insights offered by more granular data. To this end, this research examines each county at the pixel level and applies multiple instance learning to leverage detailed information within a county. In addition, our method addresses the "mixed pixel" issue caused by the inconsistent resolution between feature datasets and crop mask, which may introduce noise into the model and therefore hinder accurate yield prediction. Specifically, the attention mechanism is employed to automatically assign weights to different pixels, which can mitigate the influence of mixed pixels. The experimental results show that the developed model outperforms four other machine learning models over the past five years in the U.S. corn belt and demonstrates its best performance in 2022, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.84 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.83. This paper demonstrates the advantages of our approach from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, through an in-depth study of the relationship between mixed pixels and attention, it is verified that our approach can capture critical feature information while filtering out noise from mixed pixels.

Abstract: Learning to ground natural language queries to target objects or regions in 3D point clouds is quite essential for 3D scene understanding. Nevertheless, existing 3D visual grounding approaches require a substantial number of bounding box annotations for text queries, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose 3D-VLA, a weakly supervised approach for 3D visual grounding based on Visual Linguistic Alignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior ability of current large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds with no need for fine-grained box annotations in the training procedure. During the inference stage, the learned text-3D correspondence will help us ground the text queries to the 3D target objects even without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly supervised manner by involving large scale vision-language models, and extensive experiments on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our 3D-VLA achieves comparable and even superior results over the fully supervised methods.

Abstract: In multi-modal learning, some modalities are more influential than others, and their absence can have a significant impact on classification/segmentation accuracy. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Meta-learned Modality-weighted Knowledge Distillation (MetaKD), which enables multi-modal models to maintain high accuracy even when key modalities are missing. MetaKD adaptively estimates the importance weight of each modality through a meta-learning process. These learned importance weights guide a pairwise modality-weighted knowledge distillation process, allowing high-importance modalities to transfer knowledge to lower-importance ones, resulting in robust performance despite missing inputs. Unlike previous methods in the field, which are often task-specific and require significant modifications, our approach is designed to work in multiple tasks (e.g., segmentation and classification) with minimal adaptation. Experimental results on five prevalent datasets, including three Brain Tumor Segmentation datasets (BraTS2018, BraTS2019 and BraTS2020), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) classification dataset and the Audiovision-MNIST classification dataset, demonstrate the proposed model is able to outperform the compared models by a large margin.

Abstract: Cancer diagnosis has greatly benefited from the integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with multiple instance learning (MIL), enabling high-resolution analysis of tissue morphology. Graph-based MIL (GNN-MIL) approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for capturing contextual information in WSIs, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. However, WSIs require significant computational and infrastructural resources, limiting accessibility in resource-constrained settings. Conventional light microscopes offer a cost-effective alternative, but applying GNN-MIL to such data is challenging due to extensive redundant images and missing spatial coordinates, which hinder contextual learning. To address these issues, we introduce MicroMIL, the first weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically designed for images acquired from conventional light microscopes. MicroMIL leverages a representative image extractor (RIE) that employs deep cluster embedding (DCE) and hard Gumbel-Softmax to dynamically reduce redundancy and select representative images. These images serve as graph nodes, with edges computed via cosine similarity, eliminating the need for spatial coordinates while preserving contextual information. Extensive experiments on a real-world colon cancer dataset and the BreakHis dataset demonstrate that MicroMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both diagnostic accuracy and robustness to redundancy.

Abstract: Hierarchical visual localization methods achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but require substantial memory as they need to store all database images. Direct 2D-3D matching requires significantly less memory but suffers from lower accuracy due to the larger and more ambiguous search space. We address this ambiguity by fusing local and global descriptors using a weighted average operator. This operator rearranges the local descriptor space so that geographically nearby local descriptors are closer in the feature space according to the global descriptors. This decreases the number of irrelevant competing descriptors, especially if they are geographically distant, thus increasing the correct matching likelihood. We consistently improve the accuracy over local-only systems, and we achieve performance close to hierarchical methods while using 43\% less memory and running 1.6 times faster. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets -- Cambridge Landmarks, Aachen Day/Night, RobotCar Seasons, and Extended CMU Seasons -- demonstrate that, for the first time, direct matching algorithms can benefit from global descriptors without compromising computational efficiency.

<title>MCGS: Multiview Consistency Enhancement for Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Radiance Fields</title>

Abstract: Radiance fields represented by 3D Gaussians excel at synthesizing novel views, offering both high training efficiency and fast rendering. However, with sparse input views, the lack of multi-view consistency constraints results in poorly initialized Gaussians and unreliable heuristics for optimization, leading to suboptimal performance. Existing methods often incorporate depth priors from dense estimation networks but overlook the inherent multi-view consistency in input images. Additionally, they rely on dense initialization, which limits the efficiency of scene representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, named MCGS, enabling photorealistic scene reconstruction from sparse views. The key innovations of MCGS in enhancing multi-view consistency are as follows: i) We leverage matching priors from a sparse matcher to initialize Gaussians primarily on textured regions, while low-texture areas are populated with randomly distributed Gaussians. This yields a compact yet sufficient set of initial Gaussians. ii) We propose a multi-view consistency-guided progressive pruning strategy to dynamically eliminate inconsistent Gaussians. This approach confines their optimization to a consistency-constrained space, which ensures robust and coherent scene reconstruction. These strategies enhance robustness to sparse views, accelerate rendering, and reduce memory consumption, making MCGS a practical framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: We introduce PASTA (Perceptual Assessment System for explanaTion of Artificial Intelligence), a novel human-centric framework for evaluating eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques in computer vision. Our first contribution is the creation of the PASTA-dataset, the first large-scale benchmark that spans a diverse set of models and both saliency-based and concept-based explanation methods. This dataset enables robust, comparative analysis of XAI techniques based on human judgment. Our second contribution is an automated, data-driven benchmark that predicts human preferences using the PASTA-dataset. This scoring called PASTA-score method offers scalable, reliable, and consistent evaluation aligned with human perception. Additionally, our benchmark allows for comparisons between explanations across different modalities, an aspect previously unaddressed. We then propose to apply our scoring method to probe the interpretability of existing models and to build more human interpretable XAI methods.

Abstract: Human communication often relies on visual cues to resolve ambiguity. While humans can intuitively integrate these cues, AI systems often find it challenging to engage in sophisticated multimodal reasoning. We introduce VAGUE, a benchmark evaluating multimodal AI systems' ability to integrate visual context for intent disambiguation. VAGUE consists of 1.6K ambiguous textual expressions, each paired with an image and multiple-choice interpretations, where the correct answer is only apparent with visual context. The dataset spans both staged, complex (Visual Commonsense Reasoning) and natural, personal (Ego4D) scenes, ensuring diversity. Our experiments reveal that existing multimodal AI models struggle to infer the speaker's true intent. While performance consistently improves from the introduction of more visual cues, the overall accuracy remains far below human performance, highlighting a critical gap in multimodal reasoning. Analysis of failure cases demonstrates that current models fail to distinguish true intent from superficial correlations in the visual scene, indicating that they perceive images but do not effectively reason with them. We release our code and data at https://hazel-heejeong-nam.github.io/vague/.

<title>ZoomEye: Enhancing Multimodal LLMs with Human-Like Zooming Capabilities through Tree-Based Image Exploration</title>

Abstract: An image, especially with high-resolution, typically consists of numerous visual elements, ranging from dominant large objects to fine-grained detailed objects. When perceiving such images, multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) face limitations due to the restricted input resolution of the pretrained vision encoder and the cluttered, dense context of the image, resulting in a focus on primary objects while easily overlooking detailed ones. In this paper, we propose Zoom Eye, a tree search algorithm designed to navigate the hierarchical and visual nature of images to capture relevant information. Zoom Eye conceptualizes an image as a tree, with each children node representing a zoomed sub-patch of the parent node and the root represents the overall image. Moreover, Zoom Eye is model-agnostic and training-free, so it enables any MLLMs to simulate human zooming actions by searching along the image tree from root to leaf nodes, seeking out pertinent information, and accurately responding to related queries. We experiment on a series of elaborate high-resolution benchmarks and the results demonstrate that Zoom Eye not only consistently improves the performance of a series base MLLMs with large margin~(e.g., LLaVA-v1.5-7B increases by 34.57\% on $V^*$ Bench and 17.88\% on HR-Bench), but also enables small 7B MLLMs to outperform strong large models such as GPT-4o.

Abstract: Modern deep-learning super-resolution (SR) techniques process images and videos independently of the underlying content and viewing conditions. However, the sensitivity of the human visual system (HVS) to image details changes depending on the underlying image characteristics, such as spatial frequency, luminance, color, contrast, or motion; as well viewing condition aspects such as ambient lighting and distance to the display. This observation suggests that computational resources spent on up-sampling images/videos may be wasted whenever a viewer cannot resolve the synthesized details i.e the resolution of details exceeds the resolving capability of human vision. Motivated by this observation, we propose a human vision inspired and architecture-agnostic approach for controlling SR techniques to deliver visually optimal results while limiting computational complexity. Its core is an explicit Human Visual Processing Framework (HVPF) that dynamically and locally guides SR methods according to human sensitivity to specific image details and viewing conditions. We demonstrate the application of our framework in combination with network branching to improve the computational efficiency of SR methods. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing FLOPS by factors of 2$\times$ and greater, without sacrificing perceived quality.

Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have revolutionized photorealistic rendering of novel views for 3D scenes. Despite their growing popularity and efficiency as 3D resources, NeRFs face scalability challenges due to the need for separate models per scene and the cumulative increase in training time for multiple scenes. The potential for incrementally encoding multiple 3D scenes into a single NeRF model remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce Continual-Neural Graphics Primitives (C-NGP), a novel continual learning framework that integrates multiple scenes incrementally into a single neural radiance field. Using a generative replay approach, C-NGP adapts to new scenes without requiring access to old data. We demonstrate that C-NGP can accommodate multiple scenes without increasing the parameter count, producing high-quality novel-view renderings on synthetic and real datasets. Notably, C-NGP models all $8$ scenes from the Real-LLFF dataset together, with only a $2.2\%$ drop in PSNR compared to vanilla NeRF, which models each scene independently. Further, C-NGP allows multiple style edits in the same network.

<title>Inspiring the Next Generation of Segment Anything Models: Comprehensively Evaluate SAM and SAM 2 with Diverse Prompts Towards Context-Dependent Concepts under Different Scenes</title>

Abstract: As large-scale foundation models trained on billions of image--mask pairs covering a vast diversity of scenes, objects, and contexts, SAM and its upgraded version, SAM~2, have significantly influenced multiple fields within computer vision. Leveraging such unprecedented data diversity, they exhibit strong open-world segmentation capabilities, with SAM~2 further enhancing these capabilities to support high-quality video segmentation. While SAMs (SAM and SAM~2) have demonstrated excellent performance in segmenting context-independent concepts like people, cars, and roads, they overlook more challenging context-dependent (CD) concepts, such as visual saliency, camouflage, industrial defects, and medical lesions. CD concepts rely heavily on global and local contextual information, making them susceptible to shifts in different contexts, which requires strong discriminative capabilities from the model. The lack of comprehensive evaluation of SAMs limits understanding of their performance boundaries, which may hinder the design of future models. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of SAMs on 11 CD concepts across 2D and 3D images and videos in various visual modalities within natural, medical, and industrial scenes. We develop a unified evaluation framework for SAM and SAM~2 that supports manual, automatic, and intermediate self-prompting, aided by our specific prompt generation and interaction strategies. We further explore the potential of SAM~2 for in-context learning and introduce prompt robustness testing to simulate real-world imperfect prompts. Finally, we analyze the benefits and limitations of SAMs in understanding CD concepts and discuss their future development in segmentation tasks.

Abstract: This paper aims to tackle the problem of photorealistic view synthesis from vehicle sensor data. Recent advancements in neural scene representation have achieved notable success in rendering high-quality autonomous driving scenes, but the performance significantly degrades as the viewpoint deviates from the training trajectory. To mitigate this problem, we introduce StreetCrafter, a novel controllable video diffusion model that utilizes LiDAR point cloud renderings as pixel-level conditions, which fully exploits the generative prior for novel view synthesis, while preserving precise camera control. Moreover, the utilization of pixel-level LiDAR conditions allows us to make accurate pixel-level edits to target scenes. In addition, the generative prior of StreetCrafter can be effectively incorporated into dynamic scene representations to achieve real-time rendering. Experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and PandaSet demonstrate that our model enables flexible control over viewpoint changes, enlarging the view synthesis regions for satisfying rendering, which outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: We propose CAD-Assistant, a general-purpose CAD agent for AI-assisted design. Our approach is based on a powerful Vision and Large Language Model (VLLM) as a planner and a tool-augmentation paradigm using CAD-specific tools. CAD-Assistant addresses multimodal user queries by generating actions that are iteratively executed on a Python interpreter equipped with the FreeCAD software, accessed via its Python API. Our framework is able to assess the impact of generated CAD commands on geometry and adapts subsequent actions based on the evolving state of the CAD design. We consider a wide range of CAD-specific tools including a sketch image parameterizer, rendering modules, a 2D cross-section generator, and other specialized routines. CAD-Assistant is evaluated on multiple CAD benchmarks, where it outperforms VLLM baselines and supervised task-specific methods. Beyond existing benchmarks, we qualitatively demonstrate the potential of tool-augmented VLLMs as general-purpose CAD solvers across diverse workflows.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) enables spatial understanding, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous navigation, yet deep learning approaches often predict only relative depth without a consistent metric scale. This limitation reduces reliability in applications such as visual SLAM, precise 3D modeling, and view synthesis. Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) overcomes this challenge by producing depth maps with absolute scale, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling deployment without additional calibration. This survey reviews the evolution of MMDE, from geometry-based methods to state-of-the-art deep models, with emphasis on the datasets that drive progress. Key benchmarks, including KITTI, NYU-D, ApolloScape, and TartanAir, are examined in terms of modality, scene type, and application domain. Methodological advances are analyzed, covering domain generalization, boundary preservation, and the integration of synthetic and real data. Techniques such as unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, patch-based inference, architectural innovations, and generative modeling are evaluated for their strengths and limitations. By synthesizing current progress, highlighting the importance of high-quality datasets, and identifying open challenges, this survey provides a structured reference for advancing MMDE and supporting its adoption in real-world computer vision systems.

<title>Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection by Balancing Domain Diversity and Invariance</title>

Abstract: Single-domain generalization for object detection (S-DGOD) seeks to transfer learned representations from a single source domain to unseen target domains. While recent approaches have primarily focused on achieving feature invariance, they ignore that domain diversity also presents significant challenges for the task. First, such invariance-driven strategies often lead to the loss of domain-specific information, resulting in incomplete feature representations. Second, cross-domain feature alignment forces the model to overlook domain-specific discrepancies, thereby increasing the complexity of the training process. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Diversity Invariant Detection Model (DIDM), which achieves a harmonious integration of domain-specific diversity and domain invariance. Our key idea is to learn the invariant representations by keeping the inherent domain-specific features. Specifically, we introduce the Diversity Learning Module (DLM). This module limits the invariant semantics while explicitly enhancing domain-specific feature representation through a proposed feature diversity loss. Furthermore, to ensure cross-domain invariance without sacrificing diversity, we incorporate the Weighted Aligning Module (WAM) to enable feature alignment while maintaining the discriminative domain-specific information. Extensive experiments on multiple diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present PromptGAR, a novel framework for Group Activity Recognition (GAR) that offering both input flexibility and high recognition accuracy. The existing approaches suffer from limited real-world applicability due to their reliance on full prompt annotations, fixed number of frames and instances, and the lack of actor consistency. To bridge the gap, we proposed PromptGAR, which is the first GAR model to provide input flexibility across prompts, frames, and instances without the need for retraining. We leverage diverse visual prompts, like bounding boxes, skeletal keypoints, and instance identities, by unifying them as point prompts. A recognition decoder then cross-updates class and prompt tokens for enhanced performance. To ensure actor consistency for extended activity durations, we also introduce a relative instance attention mechanism that directly encodes instance identities. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PromptGAR achieves competitive performances both on full prompts and partial prompt inputs, establishing its effectiveness on input flexibility and generalization ability for real-world applications.

Abstract: While image-text foundation models have succeeded across diverse downstream tasks, they still face challenges in the presence of spurious correlations between the input and label. To address this issue, we propose a simple three-step approach,Project-Probe-Aggregate (PPA), that enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning for foundation models without relying on group annotations. Building upon the failure-based debiasing scheme, our method, PPA, improves its two key components: minority samples identification and the robust training algorithm. Specifically, we first train biased classifiers by projecting image features onto the nullspace of class proxies from text encoders. Next, we infer group labels using the biased classifier and probe group targets with prior correction. Finally, we aggregate group weights of each class to produce the debiased classifier. Our theoretical analysis shows that our PPA enhances minority group identification and is Bayes optimal for minimizing the balanced group error, mitigating spurious correlations. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our PPA: it outperforms the state-of-the-art by an average worst-group accuracy while requiring less than 0.01% tunable parameters without training group labels.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient tuning (PET) aims to transfer pre-trained foundation models to downstream tasks by learning a small number of parameters. Compared to traditional fine-tuning, which updates the entire model, PET significantly reduces storage and transfer costs for each task regardless of exponentially increasing pre-trained model capacity. However, most PET methods inherit the inference latency of their large backbone models and often introduce additional computational overhead due to additional modules (e.g. adapters), limiting their practicality for compute-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning (FPET), a novel approach that enhances inference speed and training efficiency while maintaining high storage efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play token redundancy reduction module delicately designed for PET. This module refines tokens from the self-attention layer using an adapter to learn the accurate similarity between tokens and cuts off the tokens through a fully-differentiable token merging strategy, which uses a straight-through estimator for optimal token reduction. Experimental results prove that our FPET achieves faster inference and higher memory efficiency than the pre-trained backbone while keeping competitive performance on par with state-of-the-art PET methods.

Abstract: As an important task in intelligent transportation systems, Aerial-Ground person Re-IDentification (AG-ReID) aims to retrieve specific persons across heterogeneous cameras in different viewpoints. Previous methods typically adopt deep learning-based models, focusing on extracting view-invariant features. However, they usually overlook the semantic information in person attributes. In addition, existing training strategies often rely on full fine-tuning large-scale models, which significantly increases training costs. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named LATex for AG-ReID, which adopts prompt-tuning strategies to leverage attribute-based text knowledge. More specifically, we first introduce the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model as the backbone, and propose an Attribute-aware Image Encoder (AIE) to extract both global semantic features and attribute-aware features from input images. Then, with these features, we propose a Prompted Attribute Classifier Group (PACG) to predict person attributes and obtain attribute representations. Finally, we design a Coupled Prompt Template (CPT) to transform attribute representations and view information into structured sentences. These sentences are processed by the text encoder of CLIP to generate more discriminative features. As a result, our framework can fully leverage attribute-based text knowledge to improve AG-ReID performance. Extensive experiments on three AG-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The source code will be available.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) equips Large Vision-language Models (LVLMs) with the ability to adapt to new tasks via multiple user-provided demonstrations, without requiring any model parameter updates. However, its effectiveness is constrained by the token-intensive nature of multimodal inputs and the complexity of cross-modal few-shot reasoning, which together hinder LVLMs from extracting useful patterns from demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{M$^2$IV}, a novel representation engineering approach that replaces explicit token-level demonstrations with a set of learnable Multimodal In-context Vectors directly injected into the residual streams of LVLMs. By analyzing the distinct roles of multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) in the ICL process, we design a training strategy that enables M$^2$IV to perform fine-grained semantic distillation and robust cross-modal representation learning. M$^2$IV not only improves performance across diverse tasks and LVLMs but also significantly reduces token overhead, enabling graceful scaling to many-shot scenarios. To further enhance usability, we introduce \textbf{VLibrary}, a repository that stores trained M$^2$IVs for flexible retrieval and injection. With VLibrary, users can steer pre-trained LVLMs in a customized manner that meets diverse requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M$^2$IV consistently outperforms vanilla ICL and prior representation engineering baselines, achieving an average accuracy gain of 3.74\% with substantial improvements in overall efficiency.

Abstract: In many medical imaging tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) efficiently extract local features hierarchically. More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for retinal disease detection. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the mode's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical tasks focused on disease detection using color fundus images. Our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to black-box and interpretable models and provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass. The code is available at: https://github.com/kdjoumessi/Self-Explainable-CNN-Transformer.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of diffusion models in image generation has increased the demand for privacy-compliant unlearning. However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning. Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing privacy-preserving generative AI.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis, yet it faces three major challenges: insufficient multi-scale feature fusion, disruption of contextual continuity, and noise interference. This study proposes a dual-stage solution to address these issues. The first stage employs a Reversible Multi-Scale Fusion Module (RMS) that uses hierarchical adaptive convolution to dynamically merge cross-scale features from capillaries to main vessels, self-adaptively calibrating feature biases. The second stage introduces a Vascular-Oriented Attention Mechanism, which models long-distance vascular continuity through an axial pathway and enhances the capture of topological key nodes, such as bifurcation points, via a dedicated bifurcation attention pathway. The synergistic operation of these two pathways effectively restores the continuity of vascular structures and improves the segmentation accuracy of complex vascular networks. Systematic experiments on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE-DB1 datasets demonstrate that WMKA-Net achieves an accuracy of 0.9909, sensitivity of 0.9198, and specificity of 0.9953, significantly outperforming existing methods. This model provides an efficient, precise, and robust intelligent solution for the early screening of diabetic retinopathy.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved success on multiple downstream tasks by aligning image and text modalities. However, the nature of global contrastive learning limits CLIP's ability to comprehend compositional concepts, such as relations and attributes. Although recent studies employ global hard negative samples to improve compositional understanding, these methods significantly compromise the model's inherent general capabilities by forcibly distancing textual negative samples from images in the embedding space. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA) framework that improves compositional understanding while substantially mitigating losses in general capabilities. To optimize the retention of the model's inherent capabilities, we incorporate a self-distillation mechanism within the global alignment process, aligning the learnable image-text encoder with a frozen teacher model derived from an exponential moving average. Under the constraint of self-distillation, it effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning. To improve compositional understanding, we first leverage the in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct about 2M high-quality negative captions across five types. Subsequently, we propose the Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC) loss to enhance vision-language compositionally. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DeGLA framework. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, DeGLA achieves an average enhancement of 3.5% across the VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO benchmarks. Concurrently, it obtains an average performance improvement of 13.0% on zero-shot classification tasks across eleven datasets. Our code will be released at https://github.com/xiaoxing2001/DeGLA

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide a promising and involuntary reflection of brain activity related to emotional states, offering significant advantages over behavioral cues like facial expressions. However, EEG signals are often noisy, affected by artifacts, and vary across individuals, complicating emotion recognition. While multimodal approaches have used Peripheral Physiological Signals (PPS) like GSR to complement EEG, they often overlook the dynamic synchronization and consistent semantics between the modalities. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of emotional fluctuations across different time resolutions in PPS remain underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose PhysioSync, a novel pre-training framework leveraging temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning, inspired by physiological synchronization phenomena. PhysioSync incorporates Cross-Modal Consistency Alignment (CM-CA) to model dynamic relationships between EEG and complementary PPS, enabling emotion-related synchronizations across modalities. Besides, it introduces Long- and Short-Term Temporal Contrastive Learning (LS-TCL) to capture emotional synchronization at different temporal resolutions within modalities. After pre-training, cross-resolution and cross-modal features are hierarchically fused and fine-tuned to enhance emotion recognition. Experiments on DEAP and DREAMER datasets demonstrate PhysioSync's advanced performance under uni-modal and cross-modal conditions, highlighting its effectiveness for EEG-centered emotion recognition.

Abstract: Echocardiography records ultrasound videos of the heart, enabling clinicians to assess cardiac function. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have spurred interest in automating echocardiographic interpretation. However, most existing medical VLMs rely on single-frame (image) inputs, which can reduce diagnostic accuracy for conditions identifiable only through cardiac motion. In addition, echocardiographic videos are captured from multiple views, each varying in suitability for detecting specific conditions. Leveraging multiple views may therefore improve diagnostic performance. We developed a video-language model that processes full video sequences from five standard views, trained on 60,747 echocardiographic video-report pairs. We evaluated the gains in retrieval performance from video input and multi-view support, including the contributions of various pretrained models.

<title>RAFT: Robust Augmentation of FeaTures for Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Image segmentation is a powerful computer vision technique for scene understanding. However, real-world deployment is stymied by the need for high-quality, meticulously labeled datasets. Synthetic data provides high-quality labels while reducing the need for manual data collection and annotation. However, deep neural networks trained on synthetic data often face the Syn2Real problem, leading to poor performance in real-world deployments.
  To mitigate the aforementioned gap in image segmentation, we propose RAFT, a novel framework for adapting image segmentation models using minimal labeled real-world data through data and feature augmentations, as well as active learning. To validate RAFT, we perform experiments on the synthetic-to-real "SYNTHIA->Cityscapes" and "GTAV->Cityscapes" benchmarks. We managed to surpass the previous state of the art, HALO. SYNTHIA->Cityscapes experiences an improvement in mIoU* upon domain adaptation of 2.1%/79.9%, and GTAV->Cityscapes experiences a 0.4%/78.2% improvement in mIoU. Furthermore, we test our approach on the real-to-real benchmark of "Cityscapes->ACDC", and again surpass HALO, with a gain in mIoU upon adaptation of 1.3%/73.2%. Finally, we examine the effect of the allocated annotation budget and various components of RAFT upon the final transfer mIoU.

Abstract: Accurately predicting 3D attributes is crucial for monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D), with depth estimation posing the greatest challenge due to the inherent ambiguity in mapping 2D images to 3D space. While existing methods leverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modeling depth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depth prediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributes are intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, which ultimately limits overall accuracy and stability. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, which leverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially and conditionally via three key designs. First, it employs a lightweight AttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features. Next, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned features from one attribute to the next. Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection to aggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that later attribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributes without forgetting the features of earlier ones. Experimental results show that our MonoCoP achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on the KITTI leaderboard without requiring additional data and further surpasses existing methods on the Waymo and nuScenes frontal datasets.

Abstract: Medical image classification is critical for clinical decision-making, yet demands for accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability remain challenging. This paper introduces EVM-Fusion, an Explainable Vision Mamba architecture featuring a novel Neural Algorithmic Fusion (NAF) mechanism for multi-organ medical image classification. EVM-Fusion leverages a multipath design, where DenseNet and U-Net based pathways, enhanced by Vision Mamba (Vim) modules, operate in parallel with a traditional feature pathway. These diverse features are dynamically integrated via a two-stage fusion process: cross-modal attention followed by the iterative NAF block, which learns an adaptive fusion algorithm. Intrinsic explainability is embedded through path-specific spatial attention, Vim {\Delta}-value maps, traditional feature SE-attention, and cross-modal attention weights. Experiments on a diverse 9-class multi-organ medical image dataset demonstrate EVM-Fusion's strong classification performance, achieving 99.75% test accuracy and provide multi-faceted insights into its decision-making process, highlighting its potential for trustworthy AI in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used to train deep learning models to address data scarcity. However, traditional data augmentation (TDA) typically relies on simple geometric transformation, such as random rotation and rescaling, resulting in minimal data diversity enrichment and limited model performance improvement. State-of-the-art generative models for 3D shape generation rely on the denoising diffusion probabilistic models and manage to generate realistic novel point clouds for 3D content creation and manipulation. Nevertheless, the generated 3D shapes lack associated point-wise semantic labels, restricting their usage in enlarging the training data for point cloud segmentation tasks. To bridge the gap between data augmentation techniques and the advanced diffusion models, we extend the state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, Lion, to a part-aware generative model that can generate high-quality point clouds conditioned on given segmentation masks. Leveraging the novel generative model, we introduce a 3-step generative data augmentation (GDA) pipeline for point cloud segmentation training. Our GDA approach requires only a small amount of labeled samples but enriches the training data with generated variants and pseudo-labeled samples, which are validated by a novel diffusion-based pseudo-label filtering method. Extensive experiments on two large-scale synthetic datasets and a real-world medical dataset demonstrate that our GDA method outperforms TDA approach and related semi-supervised and self-supervised methods.

Abstract: Egocentric human-object interaction (Ego-HOI) detection is crucial for intelligent agents to understand and assist human activities from a first-person perspective. However, progress has been hindered by the lack of benchmarks and methods tailored to egocentric challenges such as severe hand-object occlusion. In this paper, we introduce the real-world Ego-HOI detection task and the accompanying Ego-HOIBench, a new dataset with over 27K egocentric images and explicit, fine-grained hand-verb-object triplet annotations across 123 categories. Ego-HOIBench covers diverse daily scenarios, object types, and both single- and two-hand interactions, offering a comprehensive testbed for Ego-HOI research. Benchmarking existing third-person HOI detectors on Ego-HOIBench reveals significant performance gaps, highlighting the need for egocentric-specific solutions. To this end, we propose Hand Geometry and Interactivity Refinement (HGIR), a lightweight, plug-and-play scheme that leverages hand pose and geometric cues to enhance interaction representations. Specifically, HGIR explicitly extracts global hand geometric features from the estimated hand pose proposals, and further refines interaction features through pose-interaction attention, enabling the model to focus on subtle hand-object relationship differences even under severe occlusion. HGIR significantly improves Ego-HOI detection performance across multiple baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art results on Ego-HOIBench. Our dataset and method establish a solid foundation for future research in egocentric vision and human-object interaction understanding. Project page: https://dengkunyuan.github.io/EgoHOIBench/

Abstract: The high computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in processing a large number of tokens often constrain their practical application in analyzing medical images. This research proposes a Prompt-driven Adaptive Token ({\it PrATo}) pruning method to selectively reduce the processing of irrelevant tokens in the segmentation pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps to rank the tokens according to their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scores are down-weighted, ensuring that only the relevant ones are propagated for processing across subsequent stages. This data-driven pruning strategy improves segmentation accuracy and inference speed by allocating computational resources to essential regions. The proposed framework is integrated with several state-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination of irrelevant tokens, thereby enhancing computational efficiency while preserving segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of $\sim$ 35-55% tokens; thus reducing the computational costs relative to baselines. Cost-effective medical image processing, using our framework, facilitates real-time diagnosis by expanding its applicability in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment. However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed, where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction. Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-world data acquisition requires extensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and scenario coverage. Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently, we present solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the need for manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context of diffusion models.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team, HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who constitute the majority of fracture cases. Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained recognition task. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient metadata with X-rays. Thirdly, we improve the performance further by utilizing weights trained on a separate fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift. Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However, their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation, we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at https://github.com/hyebin-c/FaceMat.git

<title>Less is More: Token-Efficient Video-QA via Adaptive Frame-Pruning and Semantic Graph Integration</title>

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution. Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective, still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead. In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First, image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second, instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error, context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight performance loss.

<title>VFM-Guided Semi-Supervised Detection Transformer under Source-Free Constraints for Remote Sensing Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner, leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed, which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1) grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a zero-shot manner.

<title>Quantifying and Alleviating Co-Adaptation in Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios, despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians, i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians. The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.

Abstract: As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT), UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems. However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation takes an important position in various clinical applications. 2.5D-based segmentation models bridge the computational efficiency of 2D-based models with the spatial perception capabilities of 3D-based models. However, existing 2.5D-based models primarily adopt a single encoder to extract features of target and neighborhood slices, failing to effectively fuse inter-slice information, resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. In this study, a novel momentum encoder-based inter-slice fusion transformer (MOSformer) is proposed to overcome this issue by leveraging inter-slice information from multi-scale feature maps extracted by different encoders. Specifically, dual encoders are employed to enhance feature distinguishability among different slices. One of the encoders is moving-averaged to maintain consistent slice representations. Moreover, an inter-slice fusion transformer (IF-Trans) module is developed to fuse inter-slice multi-scale features. MOSformer is evaluated on three benchmark datasets (Synapse, ACDC, and AMOS), achieving a new state-of-the-art with 85.63%, 92.19%, and 85.43% DSC, respectively. These results demonstrate MOSformer's competitiveness in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Longitudinal brain analysis is essential for understanding healthy aging and identifying pathological deviations. Longitudinal registration of sequential brain MRI underpins such analyses. However, existing methods are limited by reliance on densely sampled time series, a trade-off between accuracy and temporal smoothness, and an inability to prospectively forecast future brain states. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \emph{TimeFlow}, a learning-based framework for longitudinal brain MRI registration. TimeFlow uses a U-Net backbone with temporal conditioning to model neuroanatomy as a continuous function of age. Given only two scans from an individual, TimeFlow estimates accurate and temporally coherent deformation fields, enabling non-linear extrapolation to predict future brain states. This is achieved by our proposed inter-/extra-polation consistency constraints applied to both the deformation fields and deformed images. Remarkably, these constraints preserve temporal consistency and continuity without requiring explicit smoothness regularizers or densely sampled sequential data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both future timepoint forecasting and registration accuracy. Moreover, TimeFlow supports novel biological brain aging analyses by differentiating neurodegenerative trajectories from normal aging without requiring segmentation, thereby eliminating the need for labor-intensive annotations and mitigating segmentation inconsistency. TimeFlow offers an accurate, data-efficient, and annotation-free framework for longitudinal analysis of brain aging and chronic diseases, capable of forecasting brain changes beyond the observed study period.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of diverse object manipulations should be able to acquire a wide range of manipulation skills with high reusability. Although advances in deep learning have made it increasingly feasible to replicate the dexterity of human teleoperation in robots, generalizing these acquired skills to previously unseen scenarios remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, Gaze-based Bottleneck-aware Robot Manipulation (GazeBot), which enables high reusability of learned motions without sacrificing dexterity or reactivity. By leveraging gaze information and motion bottlenecks, both crucial features for object manipulation, GazeBot achieves high success rates compared with state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, particularly when the object positions and end-effector poses differ from those in the provided demonstrations. Furthermore, the training process of GazeBot is entirely data-driven once a demonstration dataset with gaze data is provided. Videos and code are available at https://crumbyrobotics.github.io/gazebot.

<title>Image Coding for Machines via Feature-Preserving Rate-Distortion Optimization</title>

arXiv:2504.02216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many images and videos are primarily processed by computer vision algorithms, involving only occasional human inspection. When this content requires compression before processing, e.g., in distributed applications, coding methods must optimize for both visual quality and downstream task performance. We first show theoretically that an approach to reduce the effect of compression for a given task loss is to perform rate-distortion optimization (RDO) using the distance between features, obtained from the original and the decoded images, as a distortion metric. However, optimizing directly such a rate-distortion objective is computationally impractical because it requires iteratively encoding and decoding the entire image-plus feature evaluation-for each possible coding configuration. We address this problem by simplifying the RDO formulation to make the distortion term computable using block-based encoders. We first apply Taylor's expansion to the feature extractor, recasting the feature distance as a quadratic metric involving the Jacobian matrix of the neural network. Then, we replace the linearized metric with a block-wise approximation, which we call input-dependent squared error (IDSE). To make the metric computable, we approximate IDSE using sketches of the Jacobian. The resulting loss can be evaluated block-wise in the transform domain and combined with the sum of squared errors (SSE) to address both visual quality and computer vision performance. Simulations with AVC and HEVC across multiple feature extractors and downstream networks show up to 17 % bit-rate savings for the same task accuracy compared to RDO based on SSE, with no decoder complexity overhead and a small (7.86 %) encoder complexity increase.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic solution for the intelligent recognition and automatic analysis of microscopy images. We developed a data engine that generates high-quality annotated datasets through a combination of the collection of diverse microscopy images from experiments, synthetic data generation and a human-in-the-loop annotation process. To address the unique challenges of microscopy images, we propose a segmentation model capable of robustly detecting both small and large objects. The model effectively identifies and separates thousands of closely situated targets, even in cluttered visual environments. Furthermore, our solution supports the precise automatic recognition of image scale bars, an essential feature in quantitative microscopic analysis. Building upon these components, we have constructed a comprehensive intelligent analysis platform and validated its effectiveness and practicality in real-world applications. This study not only advances automatic recognition in microscopy imaging but also ensures scalability and generalizability across multiple application domains, offering a powerful tool for automated microscopic analysis in interdisciplinary research. A online application is made available for researchers to access and evaluate the proposed automated analysis service.

Abstract: Neural networks are often described as black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge of understanding their internal workings and interactions. We propose a different perspective that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on this insight, we propose to leverage our cognitive tendency of chunking to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract recurring chunks on a neural population level, complementing each other based on label availability and neural data dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) learns a dictionary of entities in a lower-dimensional neural space; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting concept-encoding entities agnostic to model architectures. These concepts can be both concrete (words), abstract (POS tags), or structural (narrative schema). Additionally, we show that extracted chunks play a causal role in network behavior, as grafting them leads to controlled and predictable changes in the model's behavior. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction, visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10 demonstrations.

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore, the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application http://raredx.cn/doctor.

Abstract: Quantitative imaging (QI) is demonstrating strong promise across multiple clinical applications. For clinical translation of QI methods, objective evaluation on clinically relevant tasks is essential. To address this need, multiple evaluation strategies are being developed. In this paper, based on previous literature, we outline four emerging frameworks to perform evaluation studies of QI methods. We first discuss the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) to evaluate QI methods. Next, we outline a no-gold-standard evaluation framework to clinically evaluate QI methods without ground truth. Third, a framework to evaluate QI methods for joint detection and quantification tasks is outlined. Finally, we outline a framework to evaluate QI methods that output multi-dimensional parameters, such as radiomic features. We review these frameworks, discussing their utilities and limitations. Further, we examine future research areas in evaluation of QI methods. Given the recent advancements in PET, including long axial field-of-view scanners and the development of artificial-intelligence algorithms, we present these frameworks in the context of PET.

Abstract: Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions, ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting. Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning. TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore, despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images. Code and more results are available at https://jeongyun0609.github.io/TRAN-D/.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL) and radiomics-based methods, is increasingly used for cancer outcome prediction with PET and SPECT imaging. However, the comparative performance of handcrafted radiomics features (HRF), deep radiomics features (DRF), DL models, and hybrid fusion approaches remains inconsistent across clinical applications. This systematic review analyzed 226 studies published from 2020 to 2025 that applied ML to PET or SPECT imaging for outcome prediction. Each study was evaluated using a 59-item framework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation methods, interpretability, and risk of bias. We extracted key details including model type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics such as accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). PET-based studies (95%) generally outperformed those using SPECT, likely due to higher spatial resolution and sensitivity. DRF models achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.862), while fusion models yielded the highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant differences in performance (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Common limitations included inadequate handling of class imbalance (59%), missing data (29%), and low population diversity (19%). Only 48% of studies adhered to IBSI standards. These findings highlight the need for standardized pipelines, improved data quality, and explainable AI to support clinical integration.

Abstract: Human shape editing enables controllable transformation of a person's body shape, such as thin, muscular, or overweight, while preserving pose, identity, clothing, and background. Unlike human pose editing, which has advanced rapidly, shape editing remains relatively underexplored. Current approaches typically rely on 3D morphable models or image warping, often introducing unrealistic body proportions, texture distortions, and background inconsistencies due to alignment errors and deformations. A key limitation is the lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets for training and evaluating body shape manipulation methods. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale dataset of 18,573 images across 1523 subjects, specifically designed for controlled human shape editing. It features diverse variations in body shape, including fat, muscular and thin, captured under consistent identity, clothing, and background conditions. Using this dataset, we propose Odo, an end-to-end diffusion-based method that enables realistic and intuitive body reshaping guided by simple semantic attributes. Our approach combines a frozen UNet that preserves fine-grained appearance and background details from the input image with a ControlNet that guides shape transformation using target SMPL depth maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches, achieving per-vertex reconstruction errors as low as 7.5mm, significantly lower than the 13.6mm observed in baseline methods, while producing realistic results that accurately match the desired target shapes.

<div> Keywords: real robots, training-free retrieval, image action trajectories, hierarchical search, real-time control

Summary:
RT-Cache proposes a novel approach for training-free retrieval-as-control in real robots, enabling them to repeat behaviors in new environments with minimal new data. The system caches diverse image action trajectories in a unified vector memory and retrieves and replays multi-step snippets at test time, eliminating the need for per-step model calls. A hierarchical search ensures quick lookups at a large scale, shifting the computational cost to storage and enabling real-time control on standard GPUs. Across various real-robot tasks and datasets, RT-Cache outperforms strong retrieval baselines with approximately double the success rate and 30% faster completion time. An anchoring study demonstrates immediate adaptation to more complex tasks without requiring fine-tuning. RT-Cache facilitates few-shot deployment and serves as a foundation for incorporating multimodal keys and integrating with high-level policies. This approach transforms experience into an append-only memory, offering scalability and simplicity in real-world robotic applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Real robots are expected to repeat the same behavior in new environments with very little new data, yet modern controllers either incur heavy per-step inference or require deployment-time fine-tuning. We propose RT-Cache, a training-free retrieval-as-control pipeline that caches diverse image action trajectories in a unified vector memory and, at test time, embeds the current frame to retrieve and replay multi-step snippets, replacing per-step model calls. A hierarchical search keeps lookups sub-second at million scale, shifting cost from compute to storage and enabling real-time control on modest GPUs. Across real-robot tasks and large open logs, RT-Cache achieves higher success and lower completion time than strong retrieval baselines (approximately x2 higher success and ~30% faster in our settings), and a single-episode anchoring study shows immediate adaptation to a more complex, contact-rich task without fine-tuning. RT-Cache turns experience into an append-only memory, offering a simple, scalable path to few-shot deployment today and a foundation for multimodal keys and optional integration with high-level policies.

<div> Fractional Fourier Transform, Cross-Image Feature Matching, Deformable Image Registration, Transformer-Based Architecture, Medical Image Alignment <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces FractMorph, a novel 3D dual-parallel transformer-based architecture for deformable image registration in medical imaging. By utilizing Fractional Cross-Attention blocks with multi-domain fractional Fourier transform branches, FractMorph can capture both local and global deformations simultaneously. This approach significantly improves feature matching between fixed and moving image streams, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the ACDC cardiac MRI dataset. FractMorph-Light, a lighter variant of the model, maintains high accuracy while reducing model complexity. The method shows promising results on a cerebral atlas-to-patient dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The study highlights the efficiency and robustness of utilizing multi-domain spectral-spatial attention in transformers for modeling complex non-rigid deformations in medical images, eliminating the need for specialized tuning or hierarchical multi-scale networks. <div>

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a crucial and challenging technique for aligning anatomical structures in medical images and is widely applied in diverse clinical applications. However, existing approaches often struggle to capture fine-grained local deformations and large-scale global deformations simultaneously within a unified framework. We present FractMorph, a novel 3D dual-parallel transformer-based architecture that enhances cross-image feature matching through multi-domain fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) branches. Each Fractional Cross-Attention (FCA) block applies parallel FrFTs at fractional angles of $0^\circ$, $45^\circ$, $90^\circ$, along with a log-magnitude branch, to effectively extract local, semi-global, and global features at the same time. These features are fused via cross-attention between the fixed and moving image streams. A lightweight U-Net style network then predicts a dense deformation field from the transformer-enriched features. On the intra-patient ACDC cardiac MRI dataset, FractMorph achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of $86.45\%$, an average per-structure DSC of $75.15\%$, and a 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) of $1.54~\mathrm{mm}$ on our data split. FractMorph-Light, a lightweight variant of our model with only 29.6M parameters, preserves high accuracy while halving model complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of our approach with solid performance on a cerebral atlas-to-patient dataset. Our results demonstrate that multi-domain spectral-spatial attention in transformers can robustly and efficiently model complex non-rigid deformations in medical images using a single end-to-end network, without the need for scenario-specific tuning or hierarchical multi-scale networks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex multimodal tasks. While MLLMs excel at visual perception and reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to hallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates. Our benchmark will be open-sourced for reproducibility.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework aimed at addressing the limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing. The method involves reprojecting the iToF depth map onto the RGB coordinate system to achieve pixel-level correspondence between modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is utilized to extract features from the depth and RGB images, guided by monocular depth priors for depth super-resolution. By incorporating cross-modal structural cues and depth consistency constraints, the proposed approach enhances depth accuracy, sharpens edges, and expands the field-of-view seamlessly. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the framework in terms of accuracy, structural consistency, and visual quality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy, improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, structural consistency, and visual quality.

Summary: CountLoop is a novel framework that enhances diffusion models in generating precise numbers of object instances in complex scenes. Through iterative structured feedback, a language-guided planner and critic evaluate object counts, spatial arrangements, and attribute consistency to guide image generation. Instance-driven attention masking and compositional generation techniques improve object separation, especially in occluded scenes.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings. We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation, where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score of 0.97.

Summary:
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have excelled in integrating visual and textual information for tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. However, they face challenges in compositional generalization and object binding. This study investigates the underlying reasons for these difficulties using mechanistic interpretability techniques. The researchers found that neurons in the MLP layers of CLIP's vision encoder exhibit "superposition," representing multiple features, which impairs compositional feature representation. This limitation adversely affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities in VLMs. By shedding light on these mechanisms, this research aims to lay the groundwork for understanding the root causes of compositional failures in VLMs.

<br /><br />Summary: Vision-Language Models excel at integrating visual and textual information but struggle with compositional generalization and object binding. This study examines the mechanisms behind these challenges in VLMs, revealing that neurons in the vision encoder of models like CLIP exhibit superposition, representing multiple features. This superposition impedes the models' ability to effectively represent compositional features, ultimately impacting their performance in compositional reasoning and object binding tasks. By identifying these underlying mechanisms, this research sets the stage for gaining deeper insights into the fundamental causes of compositional failures in VLMs. <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition" directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found https://github.com/Mystic-Slice/Do-VLMs-Have-Bad-Eyes .

Summary: <br />
Memory Spatial Navigation (MSNav) addresses vulnerabilities in Vision-and-Language Navigation by integrating a Memory Module for long-range exploration, a Spatial Module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference, and a Decision Module for path planning. The framework overcomes memory overload, weak spatial reasoning, and poor cross-modal grounding. A new dataset and the Qwen-Spatial model enhance object list extraction. MSNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on Room-to-Room and REVERIE datasets, with improved Success Rate and Success weighted by Path Length metrics. The integration of these modules transforms traditional black-box approaches into a more robust, integrated intelligence system, showcasing significant advancements in the VLN domain. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable quality assessment in AM applications.

Results on the CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate that The Loupe boosts accuracy significantly. Furthermore, qualitative analysis shows that The Loupe effectively localizes meaningful features, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. The Loupe acts as a powerful regularizer, improving performance while offering clear visual explanations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle, localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer. The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%. Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making process.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article discusses the impact of COVID19, caused by the SARSCoV2 virus, which led to a global pandemic in 2020. The disease primarily affects the respiratory system, with patients experiencing symptoms similar to a cold, flu, or pneumonia. Due to the respiratory failure, many lives were lost, highlighting the urgent need for effective diagnostic tools. To address this, the project aims to utilize Convolutional Neural Network models to analyze the severity of COVID19 infection based on CT scans of the lungs. By using machine learning technology, doctors can better assess the severity of the disease and determine appropriate treatment plans. This approach can help in early identification of critical cases, potentially reducing the mortality rate and improving patient outcomes. <div>
arXiv:2508.16670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT scans in the dataset.

The MedRepBench benchmark, comprising 1,900 real-world Chinese medical reports, evaluates end-to-end vision-language models and text-only models using OCR outputs combined with large language models. Two evaluation protocols measure field-level recall and automated subjective evaluation. A reward function and Group Relative Policy Optimization improve VLM performance by up to 6% recall gain. The OCR+LLM pipeline shows strong performance but suffers from layout-blindness and latency issues, highlighting the need for further advancements in vision-based report understanding.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability, and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based report understanding.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage 1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1 method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage 1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage 2 compared to baseline methods.

Summary: CellEcoNet is a novel deep learning framework that uses a "language of pathology" to analyze whole slide images of invasive lung adenocarcinoma. By treating cells as words, cellular neighborhoods as phrases, and tissue architecture as sentences, CellEcoNet captures subtle variations and spatial interactions that contribute to recurrence risk. In a study of 456 H&amp;E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet outperformed traditional grading systems and other computational methods in predicting recurrence (AUC: 77.8%, HR: 9.54). The model was found to be fair and consistently effective across different demographic and clinical subgroups. This innovative approach not only improves prognosis for ILA patients but also decodes the cellular "language" of the tumor microenvironment, providing insights into how cell variations contribute to recurrence risk.<br /><br />Summary: CellEcoNet introduces a spatially aware deep learning framework for analyzing whole slide images of invasive lung adenocarcinoma, achieving superior predictive performance in identifying patients at risk of recurrence. The model's "language of pathology" approach decodes cellular interactions and subtle variations in tissue architecture to reveal how they encode recurrence risk. CellEcoNet's innovative methodology marks a paradigm shift in understanding the tumor microenvironment and has the potential to improve prognostic accuracy for ILA patients. <div>

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA) patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases, and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&amp;E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54), outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0% HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%). CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

- This method enables comparison between different models, outlining configurations that optimize fairness for a given utility.
- Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore are used for fairness and utility evaluation, respectively.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc, human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation, respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find better hyperparameters.

WebMMU is a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web tasks: website visual question answering, code editing involving HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and mockup-to-code generation. Unlike previous benchmarks, WebMMU combines these tasks using expert-annotated web data to assess models' abilities in multi-step reasoning, element grounding, and UI comprehension and coding. The evaluation shows that multimodal large language models excel in basic information extraction but struggle with reasoning, code editing for functionality preservation, and design-to-code generation while maintaining hierarchy and supporting multilingual content.

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation.

Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content. These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

Summary: <br />
The study introduces RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that allows control over radiographic findings and patient demographic attributes. It generates a large, demographically balanced synthetic dataset of over 565,000 images. A new training strategy leveraging synthetic data for supervised pretraining and fine-tuning on real data improves model performance and fairness across demographic subgroups. Synthetic pretraining led to a 6.5% accuracy increase compared to a 2.7% increase when combining real and synthetic data. This approach also reduced the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%.

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning, facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions, we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a 6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models, compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code, trained models, and synthetic dataset at https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/RoentGen-v2 .

<br />
Summary:<br />
OVODA is a new framework proposed for open-vocabulary 3D object detection and attribute recognition in real-world scenarios. It addresses limitations of existing methods by not relying on closed-set assumptions and being able to recognize novel objects and attributes without prior anchor size information. The framework utilizes foundation models to bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts, while also detecting attributes such as spatial relationships and motion states. The authors introduce the OVAD dataset, which provides comprehensive attribute annotations to supplement existing 3D object detection benchmarks. Key innovations in OVODA include foundation model feature concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for attribute detection. Experimental results on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that OVODA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection and successful attribute recognition. <div>

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16904069 .

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images. This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only, thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging, while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

Summary: 
NinA is introduced as an alternative to diffusion-based decoders in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. It utilizes Normalizing Flows (NF) to enable one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, resulting in significantly faster inference compared to diffusion models. The integration of NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tuning on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrates that NinA can achieve performance matching its diffusion-based counterpart while providing faster inference. This suggests that NinA offers a promising solution for efficient, high-frequency VLA control without sacrificing performance. <div>
arXiv:2508.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.

arXiv:2508.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability. Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss, accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels, offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

<div> iterative framework, retinal image registration, Gaussian Primitive Optimization, structured message passing, keypoints

Summary:
Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO) is introduced as an iterative framework for deformable retinal image registration, addressing challenges like homogeneous regions and sparse vascular features. GPO utilizes structured message passing by extracting keypoints at anatomical structures and modelling them as Gaussian primitives. These primitives adapt their spatial influence to local deformation scales and propagate displacement signals globally using a KNN Gaussian interpolation. By anchoring nodes in high-gradient regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow for accurate registration. The framework is optimized via a multi-term loss enforcing keypoint consistency and intensity alignment. Experimental results on the FIRE dataset demonstrate a significant reduction in target registration error and improved AUC, outperforming existing methods. The source code for GPO can be accessed on GitHub. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures (e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment. Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to 0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in understanding human emotions and behaviors. However, current research primarily focuses on enhancing emotion recognition, neglecting emotion reasoning crucial for natural human-machine interactions. A new benchmark, MTMEUR, comprising real-life video data and progressive questions, aims to advance emotion understanding and reasoning. A multi-agent framework is proposed, with specialized agents for different aspects, to enhance reasoning capabilities. Experiments with existing MLLMs and the agent-based method on the benchmark highlight significant challenges in this task.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR) benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects, including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant challenges with this task.

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc, training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score, SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject customizations.

arXiv:2508.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach, achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively, across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up, which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing, while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

<div> Keywords: Multi-modality image fusion, adverse weather, text perception, semantic perception, AWM-Fuse <br />
Summary:<br />
The proposed method, AWM-Fuse, addresses the challenge of multi-modality image fusion in adverse weather conditions by incorporating textual information for improved semantic perception. It utilizes a global feature perception module to extract scene features and identify degradation types using BLIP-produced captions, promoting generalization across different adverse weather scenarios. The local module leverages detailed scene descriptions generated by ChatGPT to focus on specific degradation effects through textual cues, capturing finer details. By using textual descriptions to guide the fusion image generation process, the network learns to align with real semantic labels more effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms existing methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. The code for AWM-Fuse is available on GitHub for further research and implementation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.16881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response, we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions, designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this, the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues, thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks.

Summary: <br />
SAEViT is a lightweight Vision Transformer model designed for efficient downstream vision tasks, addressing the challenges of high computational cost and weak local feature modeling in traditional ViT models. It introduces a Sparsely Aggregated Attention module that utilizes adaptive sparse sampling and deconvolution operations to reduce computational complexity. The model also incorporates a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network layer to enhance inter-channel information exchange and a hierarchical pyramid structure with depth-wise separable convolutional blocks to strengthen convolutional features.

arXiv:2508.16884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks (FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively, demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

<div> Keywords: image quality assessment, deep neural network, multi-dimensional, perceptual dimensions, image restoration

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach to image quality assessment (IQA) called multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA). Unlike existing methods that focus on overall image quality scores, the MDIQA framework considers different perceptual dimensions that humans use to evaluate image quality. By modeling image quality across various technical and aesthetic dimensions, the MDIQA captures the multifaceted nature of human visual perception. The framework consists of separate branches trained for each dimension, whose features are then combined to generate a final IQA score. Additionally, the MDIQA can be used to train image restoration (IR) models, allowing for adjustments in perceptual dimension weights to align with user preferences. Experimental results show that the MDIQA outperforms existing methods and is flexible in its application to image restoration tasks. The code for the MDIQA framework is publicly available for use. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score. Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image restoration tasks.

<div> viewpoint bias, 3D generation, Structural Energy-Guided Sampling, multi-view consistency, Janus artifacts

Summary:
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS) addresses the issue of viewpoint bias in text-to-3D generation by enforcing multi-view consistency at sampling time. The approach utilizes a structural energy in a PCA subspace of U-Net features to guide the denoising trajectory and improve geometric alignment while maintaining appearance fidelity. SEGS is a training-free framework that can be seamlessly integrated into existing pipelines without the need for retraining or weight modification. By injecting gradients into the denoising process, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts and enhances viewpoint consistency in 3D objects. This approach exemplifies a novel solution to the challenge of generating accurate 3D representations from textual inputs, offering a practical and effective method for improving the quality of generated geometries. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts, achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without retraining or weight modification.

Summary:
The article introduces the Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), which enhances visual recognition by integrating multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing. The architecture includes a Multi-Scale ResNet Backbone (MSRB) for extracting diverse feature representations, a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps) for partitioning features into capsules, and Cross-Agreement Routing (CAR) blocks for adaptive capsule routing. By leveraging multi-scale features and enhancing routing mechanisms, MSPCaps achieves superior classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. The model's scalability and robustness are demonstrated across different configurations, from the highly efficient Tiny model to the powerful Large model, showcasing its potential for advancing feature representation learning. <div>
arXiv:2508.16922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing. Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size, equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields. Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters) to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in advancing feature representation learning.

arXiv:2508.16927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR), recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols, holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI: 0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces. However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned 3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our work is available at: https://github.com/qsong2001/Invert3D.

<div> adversarial perturbations, transferability, Neuron Attack for Transferability, ImageNet models, fooling rates <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a method aimed at generating transferable adversarial perturbations by targeting specific neurons within a neural network's embedding. Unlike previous approaches that focused on layer-level optimizations, NAT hones in on individual neurons to disrupt the core units of the network, resulting in enhanced transferability across different models. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and fine-grained models demonstrate NAT's superior fooling rates in both cross-model and cross-domain scenarios. Leveraging the attacking capabilities of trained generators, NAT achieves impressive fooling rates with minimal queries, outperforming existing baselines. The code for NAT is publicly available for further exploration and application. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts, leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental, neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41 diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates within just 10 queries.

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step, from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity. Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios. RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST) strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field. This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting: emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics, Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC), to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

<div> Keywords: regression, imbalanced data, generalization ability, sharpness-aware minimization, vision tasks

Summary:
Regression is a key aspect of computer vision tasks, but it often struggles with imbalanced data distributions. This paper reframes the imbalanced regression problem as an imbalanced generalization challenge. The proposed approach, Balanced Sharpness-Aware Minimization (BSAM), focuses on improving the generalization ability of regression models throughout the observation space. By incorporating a novel targeted reweighting strategy, BSAM ensures uniform performance across all target observations, leading to better overall model performance. Experimental results on various vision regression tasks such as age and depth estimation showcase the superiority of the BSAM method compared to existing approaches. The code for the BSAM method is also available for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely, given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model performance changes according to the loss values of different target observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular, we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

Summary:<br />
- Domain generalization aims to develop models that can generalize to unseen domains.<br />
- Full fine-tuning of pre-trained models can compromise their generalization capabilities.<br />
- Joint Parameter Selection (JPS) method selectively fine-tunes a small subset of parameters to balance task adaptation and generalization.<br />

arXiv:2508.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates, thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning. Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy, surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis. While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost. Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs), and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets. EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code, pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at https://github.com/riadhassan/EDLDNet .

Summary: 
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC) is introduced as a novel Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) framework. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encapsulate inter-class relationships. The framework incorporates a class-aware patch-level contrastive loss to ensure both intra-class consistency and inter-class separation. By utilizing clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors while preserving fine-grained boundaries, CPC reduces confusion among visually similar categories. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 showcase the superiority of CPC over existing state-of-the-art methods in weakly supervised semantic segmentation. <div>

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation. This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting (GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured marker representations.

Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world applications.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel sampling guidance strategy called Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG) to improve Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) models. These models often struggle with memorizing training samples and producing artifacts or distortions in the generated text, especially for challenging writing styles. DOG leverages orthogonal projection to steer generation away from artifacts while maintaining content, leading to more diverse yet plausible outputs. Unlike standard guidance approaches, DOG provides stable, disentangled directions in the latent space, enhancing both content clarity and style variability. The technique applies a triangular schedule to control guidance strength throughout the denoising process, resulting in improved performance on state-of-the-art models like DiffusionPen and One-DM, even for out-of-vocabulary words and challenging writing styles.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales, DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and challenging writing styles.

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision, Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA) model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features. Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs), cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) for cross-domain deepfake detection. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by focusing on discriminative local features using a Salience Network (SNet) and Top-K Pooling (TKP) module. To enhance model robustness, Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS) regularization techniques are introduced. LFM outperforms the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel Relationships (NPR) method in accuracy and average precision, while maintaining high efficiency at 1789 FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. The proposed approach sets a new benchmark for deepfake detection across different object categories and generation domains. The source code is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains (e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories, especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP) compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP) module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789 FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in https://github.com/lmlpy/LFM.git

<div> image-text matching, retrieval, food, feature fusion, VLM-guided framework

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework called F4-ITS for food image-to-text matching, essential for dietary monitoring and smart kitchen applications. F4-ITS utilizes a uni-directional and bi-directional multi-modal fusion strategy to combine image embeddings with VLM-generated textual descriptions, enhancing query expressiveness. Additionally, a feature-based re-ranking mechanism leveraging predicted food ingredients refines results for improved precision. The framework outperforms standard baselines with ~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse captions and a substantial ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Interestingly, smaller models like ViT-B/32 can match or surpass larger counterparts through textual fusion, showcasing efficacy in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust and accurate systems capable of fine-grained visual understanding and retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring, smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving ~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally, we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: 3D mapping in dynamic environments poses a challenge for modern researchers in robotics and autonomous transportation. There are no universal representations for dynamic 3D scenes that incorporate multimodal data such as images, point clouds, and text. This article takes a step toward solving this problem. It proposes a taxonomy of methods for constructing multimodal 3D maps, classifying contemporary approaches based on scene types and representations, learning methods, and practical applications. Using this taxonomy, a brief structured analysis of recent methods is provided. The article also describes an original modular method called M3DMap, designed for object-aware construction of multimodal 3D maps for both static and dynamic scenes. It consists of several interconnected components: a neural multimodal object segmentation and tracking module; an odometry estimation module, including trainable algorithms; a module for 3D map construction and updating with various implementations depending on the desired scene representation; and a multimodal data retrieval module. The article highlights original implementations of these modules and their advantages in solving various practical tasks, from 3D object grounding to mobile manipulation. Additionally, it presents theoretical propositions demonstrating the positive effect of using multimodal data and modern foundational models in 3D mapping methods.

Abstract: We present StyleClone, a method for training image-to-image translation networks to stylize faces in a specific style, even with limited style images. Our approach leverages textual inversion and diffusion-based guided image generation to augment small style datasets. By systematically generating diverse style samples guided by both the original style images and real face images, we significantly enhance the diversity of the style dataset. Using this augmented dataset, we train fast image-to-image translation networks that outperform diffusion-based methods in speed and quality. Experiments on multiple styles demonstrate that our method improves stylization quality, better preserves source image content, and significantly accelerates inference.

<title>PVNet: Point-Voxel Interaction LiDAR Scene Upsampling Via Diffusion Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17050</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code will be available at https://github.com/chengxianjing/PVNet.

<title>DeltaFlow: An Efficient Multi-frame Scene Flow Estimation Method</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17054</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow ($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a $\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost, regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$ faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Kin-Zhang/DeltaFlow along with trained model weights.

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task. This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are available at: https://github.com/stefanos50/REGEN.

<title>SSG-Dit: A Spatial Signal Guided Framework for Controllable Video Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17062</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control and overall consistency.

<title>Proximal Vision Transformer: Enhancing Feature Representation through Two-Stage Manifold Geometry</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17081</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives. Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification accuracy and data distribution.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast, proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss, offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification, demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding optimization, with potential for broader applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions. Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain (OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to 54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be released open-source.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper, we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes, including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98, and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet, EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and devices used on-farm

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic (CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data. Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover, Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps, enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08% sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

Abstract: Natural disasters pose significant challenges to timely and accurate damage assessment due to their sudden onset and the extensive areas they affect. Traditional assessment methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and hazardous to personnel, making them impractical for rapid response, especially in resource-limited settings. This study proposes a novel, cost-effective framework that leverages aerial drone footage, an advanced AI-based video super-resolution model, Video Restoration Transformer (VRT), and Gemma3:27b, a 27 billion parameter Visual Language Model (VLM). This integrated system is designed to improve low-resolution disaster footage, identify structural damage, and classify buildings into four damage categories, ranging from no/slight damage to total destruction, along with associated risk levels. The methodology was validated using pre- and post-event drone imagery from the 2023 Turkey earthquakes (courtesy of The Guardian) and satellite data from the 2013 Moore Tornado (xBD dataset). The framework achieved a classification accuracy of 84.5%, demonstrating its ability to provide highly accurate results. Furthermore, the system's accessibility allows non-technical users to perform preliminary analyses, thereby improving the responsiveness and efficiency of disaster management efforts.

Abstract: Traditional video-based learning remains passive, offering limited opportunities for users to engage dynamically with content. While current AI-powered tools offer transcription and summarization, they lack real-time, region-specific interaction capabilities. This paper introduces Untwist, an AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box, receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video content to enhance comprehension. Our approach addresses GPT-4o spatial weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data, significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content. This paper describes the system architecture, including video pre-processing and real-time interaction, and outlines how Untwist can transform passive video consumption into an interactive, AI-driven learning experience with the potential to enhance engagement and comprehension.

<title>Development of an isotropic segmentation model for medial temporal lobe subregions on anisotropic MRI atlas using implicit neural representation</title>

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe (MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic, which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set. Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide more accurate measures for disease tracking.

Abstract: We introduce VROOM, a system for reconstructing 3D models of Formula 1 circuits using only onboard camera footage from racecars. Leveraging video data from the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix, we address video challenges such as high-speed motion and sharp cuts in camera frames. Our pipeline analyzes different methods such as DROID-SLAM, AnyCam, and Monst3r and combines preprocessing techniques such as different methods of masking, temporal chunking, and resolution scaling to account for dynamic motion and computational constraints. We show that Vroom is able to partially recover track and vehicle trajectories in complex environments. These findings indicate the feasibility of using onboard video for scalable 4D reconstruction in real-world settings.

arXiv:2508.17186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations (e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level) classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene, WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes, especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings. This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision, namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/zhenghuizhao/AdvCP

<title>MMCIG: Multimodal Cover Image Generation for Text-only Documents and Its Dataset Construction via Pseudo-labeling</title>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task, we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which consider captions and images separately. We release our code at: https://github.com/HyeyeeonKim/MMCIG

<title>Multi-Agent Visual-Language Reasoning for Comprehensive Highway Scene Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17205</link>

arXiv:2508.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection, achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data, highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data, such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&amp;E) stained histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To maintain the internal structural relationships between samples, Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally, Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at https://github.com/qiyuanzz/MICCAI2025_MKD.

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex, time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features. To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25% accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

<title>PersPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation with Perspective Encoding and Perspective Rotation</title>

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding (PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly, which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject, thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework, PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/ KenAdamsJoseph/PersPose.

<title>CoViPAL: Layer-wise Contextualized Visual Token Pruning for Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens, leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations. However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight, model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

<title>Uncovering and Mitigating Destructive Multi-Embedding Attacks in Deepfake Proactive Forensics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability, they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing methods against MEA.

<title>A biological vision inspired framework for machine perception of abutting grating illusory contours</title>

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection (MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work. Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models, with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based models.

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented reality (AR) that unifies semantic decomposition, Context-Aware SLAM Branches (CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR enhances perceived scene understanding, overlay relevance, and driver ease, providing an effective foundation for future research in this direction. Code and dataset will be made open source.

Abstract: Brain tumors show significant health challenges due to their potential to cause critical neurological functions. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. In this research, we propose ResLink, a novel deep learning architecture for brain tumor classification using CT scan images. ResLink integrates novel area attention mechanisms with residual connections to enhance feature learning and spatial understanding for spatially rich image classification tasks. The model employs a multi-stage convolutional pipeline, incorporating dropout, regularization, and downsampling, followed by a final attention-based refinement for classification. Trained on a balanced dataset, ResLink achieves a high accuracy of 95% and demonstrates strong generalizability. This research demonstrates the potential of ResLink in improving brain tumor classification, offering a robust and efficient technique for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however, automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification (CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt, embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning and a prompt-based baseline.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN) models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT, dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new instance-level human-object interaction detection task on videos called ST-HOID, which aims to distinguish fine-grained human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects. It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module. Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction recognition.

<title>Deep Learning-Assisted Detection of Sarcopenia in Cross-Sectional Computed Tomography Imaging</title>

arXiv:2508.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management; however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching real-time speed.

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks. Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework, QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception. Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges (e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration, human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of compositional visual reasoning research.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB) based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels.

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation, highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising, positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its practical value and potential for broad adoption.

<title>First Place Solution to the MLCAS 2025 GWFSS Challenge: The Devil is in the Detail and Minority</title>

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS 2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025, participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear margins. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/tiny-smart/gwfss25.

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation. Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA) on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models (LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured tabular images. MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated scorecard images from ODI, T20, and Test formats, accompanied by 1,500 English QA pairs. It includes two subsets: MMCRICBENCH-E-1.5K, featuring English scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning, and cross-lingual generalization. The dataset is publicly available via Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DIALab/MMCricBench, to promote LVLM research in this direction.

<title>No Pixel Left Behind: A Detail-Preserving Architecture for Robust High-Resolution AI-Generated Image Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17346</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net), a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction, ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization (TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to 64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon dataset and 10% on our HiRes-50K.

<title>DiCache: Let Diffusion Model Determine Its Own Cache</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17356</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image generation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition, leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation (UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to https://github.com/gavin-gqzhang/UniGen.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology) for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of image enhancement in complex underwater scenes by proposing a solution based on deep learning. The proposed method skillfully integrates two deep convolutional neural network models, VGG19 and ResNet50, leveraging their powerful feature extraction capabilities to perform multi-scale and multi-level deep feature analysis of underwater images. By constructing a unified model, the complementary advantages of the two models are effectively integrated, achieving a more comprehensive and accurate image enhancement effect.To objectively evaluate the enhancement effect, this paper introduces image quality assessment metrics such as PSNR, UCIQE, and UIQM to quantitatively compare images before and after enhancement and deeply analyzes the performance of different models in different scenarios.Furthermore, to improve the practicality and stability of the underwater visual enhancement system, this paper also provides practical suggestions from aspects such as model optimization, multi-model fusion, and hardware selection, aiming to provide strong technical support for visual enhancement tasks in complex underwater environments.

<title>MoCo: Motion-Consistent Human Video Generation via Structure-Appearance Decoupling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion. Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos, limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic and structurally coherent human videos.

<title>E-BayesSAM: Efficient Bayesian Adaptation of SAM with Self-Optimizing KAN-Based Interpretation for Uncertainty-Aware Ultrasonic Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image), (ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\% vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability, and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs, advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications.

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair model evaluation. Given that large-scale datasets are often sourced from the internet, where many computer vision benchmarks are publicly available, our efforts are focused into identifying and studying this phenomenon. We characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality, coverage, and degree. By applying image retrieval techniques, we unequivocally show that all the analyzed datasets present some form of leakage, and that all types of leakage, from severe instances to more subtle cases, compromise the reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

<title>Constrained Prompt Enhancement for Improving Zero-Shot Generalization of Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components: Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model, effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts. Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

<title>Robust Point Cloud Registration via Geometric Overlapping Guided Rotation Search</title>

arXiv:2508.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems. Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis. Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the number of points, even in the worst case.

arXiv:2508.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components. First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\% communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34, while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR, a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv. We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83% parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high quality results.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models, real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications, and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative, and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop. To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and 3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility. Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds, with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods. Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

arXiv:2508.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator. Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains.

<title>Multi-Level LVLM Guidance for Untrimmed Video Action Recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17442</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer (ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions, including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3 and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset, blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1 mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.

Abstract: In the field of multimodal medical data analysis, leveraging diverse types of data and understanding their hidden relationships continues to be a research focus. The main challenges lie in effectively modeling the complex interactions between heterogeneous data modalities with distinct characteristics while capturing both local and global dependencies across modalities. To address these challenges, this paper presents a two-stage multimodal prognosis model, GraphMMP, which is based on graph neural networks. The proposed model constructs feature graphs using mutual information and features a global fusion module built on Mamba, which significantly boosts prognosis performance. Empirical results show that GraphMMP surpasses existing methods on datasets related to liver prognosis and the METABRIC study, demonstrating its effectiveness in multimodal medical prognosis tasks.

arXiv:2508.17488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction, both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework, which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

Abstract: Human social behaviors are inherently multimodal necessitating the development of powerful audiovisual models for their perception. In this paper, we present Social-MAE, our pre-trained audiovisual Masked Autoencoder based on an extended version of Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked Auto-Encoder (CAV-MAE), which is pre-trained on audiovisual social data. Specifically, we modify CAV-MAE to receive a larger number of frames as input and pre-train it on a large dataset of human social interaction (VoxCeleb2) in a self-supervised manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model by finetuning and evaluating the model on different social and affective downstream tasks, namely, emotion recognition, laughter detection and apparent personality estimation. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal emotion recognition and laughter recognition and competitive results for apparent personality estimation, demonstrating the effectiveness of in-domain self-supervised pre-training.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware. By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model. This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

<title>OmniMRI: A Unified Vision--Language Foundation Model for Generalist MRI Interpretation</title>

arXiv:2508.17524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting. While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining, vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction, anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

arXiv:2508.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images (RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that 1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50 pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of 0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast lesion classification tasks.

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions. (i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000 parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

arXiv:2508.17579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement, with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon, wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion acceleration methods.

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models (VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our 64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of 66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an 80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved performance on spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or "hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images, producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query image in just a few seconds.

<title>A Weighted Vision Transformer-Based Multi-Task Learning Framework for Predicting ADAS-Cog Scores</title>

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13 sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off'' model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

<title>Improving Interpretability in Alzheimer's Prediction via Joint Learning of ADAS-Cog Scores</title>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score, an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1 (Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability. Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance, where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation, leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging, large-scale pointclouds.

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients. Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization, millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars, from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

<title>Dynamic Embedding of Hierarchical Visual Features for Efficient Vision-Language Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and inference.

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of 0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive comparisons with other popular loss functions

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection (DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training. FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability, we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale agricultural AI applications.

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/YaoleiQi/PCCAC.

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical workflows in the digital pathology domain.

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with long-form videos due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a 65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM) techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S, with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

Abstract: Super-resolution remains a promising technique to enhance the quality of low-resolution images. This study introduces CATformer (Contrastive Adversarial Transformer), a novel neural network integrating diffusion-inspired feature refinement with adversarial and contrastive learning. CATformer employs a dual-branch architecture combining a primary diffusion-inspired transformer, which progressively refines latent representations, with an auxiliary transformer branch designed to enhance robustness to noise through learned latent contrasts. These complementary representations are fused and decoded using deep Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks for enhanced reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CATformer outperforms recent transformer-based and diffusion-inspired methods both in efficiency and visual image quality. This work bridges the performance gap among transformer-, diffusion-, and GAN-based methods, laying a foundation for practical applications of diffusion-inspired transformers in super-resolution.

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality garment reconstructions.

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users' actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments, comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs, these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

arXiv:2508.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings, regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms. Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and 1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally, improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For 3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of 0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/kkanuseobin/DroneKey.

<title>From Global to Local: Social Bias Transfer in CLIP</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases, learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias, finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally, we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias mitigation practices.

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their interaction control.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and 92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect data curation is challenging.

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose, Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input. However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy. Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino, a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/UniSino.

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19 employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is released at https://github.com/Meiqi-Gong/TemCoCo.

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication to encourage future research.

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection (ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Heartfirey/SCOUT.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases like small polyps and flat lesions critical for early detection in screening applications.

arXiv:2508.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing (LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization. This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However, we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning. Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL, consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning. Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

arXiv:2508.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation. Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling, so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches, our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module. VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed. The code is available at https://github.com/mobiushy/VISA.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments, which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks, requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing 3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches, achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures, weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for real-world applications in automated content verification and digital forensics.

Abstract: We introduce ISALux, a novel transformer-based approach for Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) that seamlessly integrates illumination and semantic priors. Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction. ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning, with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed model. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization (APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks, such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text, image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and transferable prompt optimization.

<title>Designing Practical Models for Isolated Word Visual Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words, these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for augmented reality and navigation systems.

Abstract: Progress in remote PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (rPPG) is limited by the critical issues of existing publicly available datasets: small size, privacy concerns with facial videos, and lack of diversity in conditions. The paper introduces a novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings from 600 subjects, captured under varied conditions (resting and post-exercise) using multiple consumer-grade cameras at different angles. To enable multimodal analysis of physiological states, each recording is paired with a 100 Hz PPG signal and extended health metrics, such as electrocardiogram, arterial blood pressure, biomarkers, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and stress level. Using this data, we train an efficient rPPG model and compare its quality with existing approaches in cross-dataset scenarios. The public release of our dataset and model should significantly speed up the progress in the development of AI medical assistants.

<title>See What You Need: Query-Aware Visual Intelligence through Reasoning-Perception Loops</title>

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However, current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames; (2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3) confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA (76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video understanding.

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of 22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar. Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel, fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and 3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects, respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D', and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input data dimensions.

<title>SAIL-Recon: Large SfM by Augmenting Scene Regression with Localization</title>

arXiv:2508.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are publicly available at: https://hkust-sail.github.io/ sail-recon/.

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However, challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

<title>Propose and Rectify: A Forensics-Driven MLLM Framework for Image Manipulation Localization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17976</link>

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis, integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally, we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence, resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization capabilities.

<title>Fence off Anomaly Interference: Cross-Domain Distillation for Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18007</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD) framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm. Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD setting.

Abstract: Neural networks in assistive technology for visually impaired leverage artificial intelligence's capacity to recognize patterns in complex data. They are used for converting visual data into auditory or tactile representations, helping the visually impaired understand their surroundings. The primary aim of this research is to explore the potential of artificial neural networks to facilitate the differentiation of various forms of cash for individuals with visual impairments. In this study, we built a custom dataset of 3,468 images, which was subsequently used to train an SSD neural network model. The proposed system can accurately identify Nigerian cash, thereby streamlining commercial transactions. The performance of the system in terms of accuracy was assessed, and the Mean Average Precision score was over 90%. We believe that our system has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the field of assistive technology while also improving the quality of life of visually challenged persons in Nigeria and beyond.

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention, even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data, Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

<title>FCR: Investigating Generative AI models for Forensic Craniofacial Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail. Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here, we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

<title>Visual-CoG: Stage-Aware Reinforcement Learning with Chain of Guidance for Text-to-Image Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities. However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance (Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%, 5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

<title>ArgusCogito: Chain-of-Thought for Cross-Modal Synergy and Omnidirectional Reasoning in Camouflaged Object Segmentation</title>

arXiv:2508.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting: Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny. Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

arXiv:2508.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp, a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images, where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and open-world Earth observation.

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300 FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous driving, and VRAR.

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples. They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes. Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM), Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future research on generative models.

Abstract: The urgent need for renewable energy expansion, particularly wind power, is hindered by conflicts with wildlife conservation. To address this, we developed BirdRecorder, an advanced AI-based anti-collision system to protect endangered birds, especially the red kite (Milvus milvus). Integrating robotics, telemetry, and high-performance AI algorithms, BirdRecorder aims to detect, track, and classify avian species within a range of 800 m to minimize bird-turbine collisions.
  BirdRecorder integrates advanced AI methods with optimized hardware and software architectures to enable real-time image processing. Leveraging Single Shot Detector (SSD) for detection, combined with specialized hardware acceleration and tracking algorithms, our system achieves high detection precision while maintaining the speed necessary for real-time decision-making. By combining these components, BirdRecorder outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.
  In this paper, we summarize results on field tests and performance of the BirdRecorder system. By bridging the gap between renewable energy expansion and wildlife conservation, BirdRecorder contributes to a more sustainable coexistence of technology and nature.

<title>Assessing the Noise Robustness of Class Activation Maps: A Framework for Reliable Model Interpretability</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18154</link>

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties: consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class, while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

arXiv:2508.18159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained, controllable content generation. Although recent generative models have shown remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at https://github.com/SaraGhazanfari/SpotEdit.

Abstract: This study proposes the dual technological innovation framework, including a cross-modal differ entiated quantization framework for vision-language models (VLMs) and a scene-aware vectorized
  memory multi-agent system for visually impaired assistance. The modular framework was developed
  implementing differentiated processing strategies, effectively reducing memory requirements from
  38GB to 16GB while maintaining model performance. The multi-agent architecture combines
  scene classification, vectorized memory, and multimodal interaction, enabling persistent storage
  and efficient retrieval of scene memories. Through perception-memory-reasoning workflows, the
  system provides environmental information beyond the current view using historical memories.
  Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05% performance drop
  on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9), outperforming smaller
  models with equivalent memory requirements like the Molmo-7B series. The system maintains
  response latency between 2.83-3.52 seconds from scene analysis to initial speech output, substantially
  faster than non-streaming methods. This research advances computational efficiency and assistive
  technology, offering visually impaired users comprehensive real-time assistance in scene perception,
  text recognition, and navigation.

<title>Emerging Semantic Segmentation from Positive and Negative Coarse Label Learning</title>

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts. In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target) and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets: Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is small compared to the given dense annotations.

<title>BRAIN: Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning Approach to Vision-Brain Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18187</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker, uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions, leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning (BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes. Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.

<title>Follow My Hold: Hand-Object Interaction Reconstruction through Geometric Guidance</title>

<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18213</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues, including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g., accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3 percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

<title>Sealing The Backdoor: Unlearning Adversarial Text Triggers In Diffusion Models Using Knowledge Distillation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18235</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach, Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative models. Code and model weights can be found at https://github.com/Mystic-Slice/Sealing-The-Backdoor .

<title>Interpretable Evaluation of AI-Generated Content with Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18236</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs, LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI applications.

<title>PriorFormer: A Transformer for Real-time Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation with Versatile Geometric Priors</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18238</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18238</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera. The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without calibration.  The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available, and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed, the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing 3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel scenes without additional training.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem. Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore, with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of coverage in token selection.

<title>InternVL3.5: Advancing Open-Source Multimodal Models in Versatility, Reasoning, and Efficiency</title>

arXiv:2508.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD) strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs, effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor, i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e., InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code are publicly released.

<title>ObjFiller-3D: Consistent Multi-view 3D Inpainting via Video Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition, we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of 0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications.

Abstract: The emergence of audio-visual foundation models underscores the importance of reliably assessing their multi-modal understanding. The VGGSound dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification. However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSound, including incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities. These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion metric.

Abstract: Predicting user intentions in virtual reality (VR) is crucial for creating immersive experiences, particularly in tasks involving complex grasping motions where accurate haptic feedback is essential. In this work, we leverage time-series data from hand movements to evaluate both classification and regression approaches across 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and manipulations. Our findings reveal that classification models struggle to generalize across users, leading to inconsistent performance. In contrast, regression-based approaches, particularly those using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate more robust performance, with timing errors within 0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm in the critical two-second window before a grasp. Despite these improvements, predicting precise hand postures remains challenging. Through a comprehensive analysis of user variability and model interpretability, we explore why certain models fail and how regression models better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of user behavior in VR. Our results underscore the potential of machine learning models to enhance VR interactions, particularly through adaptive haptic feedback, and lay the groundwork for future advancements in real-time prediction of user actions in VR.

Abstract: Geological parameterization procedures entail the mapping of a high-dimensional geomodel to a low-dimensional latent variable. These parameterizations can be very useful for history matching because the number of variables to be calibrated is greatly reduced, and the mapping can be constructed such that geological realism is automatically preserved. In this work, a parameterization method based on generative latent diffusion models (LDMs) is developed for 3D channel-levee-mud systems. Geomodels with variable scenario parameters, specifically mud fraction, channel orientation, and channel width, are considered. A perceptual loss term is included during training to improve geological realism. For any set of scenario parameters, an (essentially) infinite number of realizations can be generated, so our LDM parameterizes over a very wide model space. New realizations constructed using the LDM procedure are shown to closely resemble reference geomodels, both visually and in terms of one- and two-point spatial statistics. Flow response distributions, for a specified set of injection and production wells, are also shown to be in close agreement between the two sets of models. The parameterization method is applied for ensemble-based history matching, with model updates performed in the LDM latent space, for cases involving geological scenario uncertainty. For three synthetic true models corresponding to different geological scenarios, we observe clear uncertainty reduction in both production forecasts and geological scenario parameters. The overall method is additionally shown to provide posterior geomodels consistent with the synthetic true model in each case.

Abstract: Brain tumour imaging assessment typically requires both pre- and post-contrast MRI, but gadolinium administration is not always desirable, such as in frequent follow-up, renal impairment, allergy, or paediatric patients. We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of predicting brain tumour contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI sequences alone. We assembled 11089 brain MRI studies from 10 international datasets spanning adult and paediatric populations with various neuro-oncological states, including glioma, meningioma, metastases, and post-resection appearances. Deep learning models (nnU-Net, SegResNet, SwinUNETR) were trained to predict and segment enhancing tumour using only non-contrast T1-, T2-, and T2/FLAIR-weighted images. Performance was evaluated on 1109 held-out test patients using patient-level detection metrics and voxel-level segmentation accuracy. Model predictions were compared against 11 expert radiologists who each reviewed 100 randomly selected patients. The best-performing nnU-Net achieved 83% balanced accuracy, 91.5% sensitivity, and 74.4% specificity in detecting enhancing tumour. Enhancement volume predictions strongly correlated with ground truth (R2 0.859). The model outperformed expert radiologists, who achieved 69.8% accuracy, 75.9% sensitivity, and 64.7% specificity. 76.8% of test patients had Dice over 0.3 (acceptable detection), 67.5% had Dice over 0.5 (good detection), and 50.2% had Dice over 0.7 (excellent detection). Deep learning can identify contrast-enhancing brain tumours from non-contrast MRI with clinically relevant performance. These models show promise as screening tools and may reduce gadolinium dependence in neuro-oncology imaging. Future work should evaluate clinical utility alongside radiology experts.

<title>A Laplace diffusion-based transformer model for heart rate forecasting within daily activity context</title>

Abstract: With the advent of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, remote patient monitoring (RPM) emerged as a promising solution for managing heart failure. However, the heart rate can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, and without correlating it to the patient's actual physical activity, it becomes difficult to assess whether changes are significant. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) models may enhance the accuracy and contextual understanding of remote heart rate monitoring, the integration of activity data is still rarely addressed. In this paper, we propose a Transformer model combined with a Laplace diffusion technique to model heart rate fluctuations driven by physical activity of the patient. Unlike prior models that treat activity as secondary, our approach conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using specialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity specific historical patents. The model captures both long-term patterns and activity-specific heart rate dynamics by incorporating contextualized embeddings and dedicated encoder. The Transformer model was validated on a real-world dataset collected from 29 patients over a 4-month period. Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the considered baseline models. Moreover, the coefficient of determination R2 is 0.97 indicating the model predicted heart rate is in strong agreement with actual heart rate values. These findings suggest that the proposed model is a practical and effective tool for supporting both healthcare providers and remote patient monitoring systems.

Abstract: Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, allowing practitioners to achieve high performance with limited labeled data. In surgical video analysis, where expert annotations are especially time-consuming and costly, identifying the most suitable pre-trained model for a downstream task is both critical and challenging. Source-independent transferability estimation (SITE) offers a solution by predicting how well a model will fine-tune on target data using only its embeddings or outputs, without requiring full retraining. In this work, we formalize SITE for surgical phase recognition and provide the first comprehensive benchmark of three representative metrics, LogME, H-Score, and TransRate, on two diverse datasets (RAMIE and AutoLaparo). Our results show that LogME, particularly when aggregated by the minimum per-subset score, aligns most closely with fine-tuning accuracy; H-Score yields only weak predictive power; and TransRate often inverses true model rankings. Ablation studies show that when candidate models have similar performances, transferability estimates lose discriminative power, emphasizing the importance of maintaining model diversity or using additional validation. We conclude with practical guidelines for model selection and outline future directions toward domain-specific metrics, theoretical foundations, and interactive benchmarking tools.

Abstract: Taxonomic classification in biodiversity research involves organizing biological specimens into structured hierarchies based on evidence, which can come from multiple modalities such as images and genetic information. We investigate whether hyperbolic networks can provide a better embedding space for such hierarchical models. Our method embeds multimodal inputs into a shared hyperbolic space using contrastive and a novel stacked entailment-based objective. Experiments on the BIOSCAN-1M dataset show that hyperbolic embedding achieves competitive performance with Euclidean baselines, and outperforms all other models on unseen species classification using DNA barcodes. However, fine-grained classification and open-world generalization remain challenging. Our framework offers a structure-aware foundation for biodiversity modelling, with potential applications to species discovery, ecological monitoring, and conservation efforts.

<title>UM3: Unsupervised Map to Map Matching</title>

Abstract: Map-to-map matching is a critical task for aligning spatial data across heterogeneous sources, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised learning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for large-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging. Second, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial layout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and enables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively balance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent loss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At the implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which enables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin, particularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of laryngo-pharyngeal tumors is crucial for precise diagnosis and effective treatment planning. However, traditional single-modality imaging methods often fall short of capturing the complex anatomical and pathological features of these tumors. In this study, we present an innovative multi-modality representation learning framework based on the `Align-Disentangle-Fusion' mechanism that seamlessly integrates 2D White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) pairs to enhance segmentation performance. A cornerstone of our approach is multi-scale distribution alignment, which mitigates modality discrepancies by aligning features across multiple transformer layers. Furthermore, a progressive feature disentanglement strategy is developed with the designed preliminary disentanglement and disentangle-aware contrastive learning to effectively separate modality-specific and shared features, enabling robust multimodal contrastive learning and efficient semantic fusion. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior accuracy across diverse real clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for diagnosing and monitoring thoracic diseases, including aortic pathologies. However, contrast agents pose risks such as nephrotoxicity and allergic-like reactions. The ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA) images without contrast administration would be transformative, enhancing patient safety and accessibility while reducing healthcare costs. In this study, we propose the first bridge diffusion-based solution for synthesizing contrast-enhanced CTA images from non-contrast CT scans. Our approach builds on the Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SC-BBDM), leveraging its ability to model complex mappings while maintaining consistency across slices. Unlike conventional slice-wise synthesis methods, our framework preserves full 3D anatomical integrity while operating in a high-resolution 2D fashion, allowing seamless volumetric interpretation under a low memory budget. To ensure robust spatial alignment, we implement a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that includes resampling, registration using the Symmetric Normalization method, and a sophisticated dilated segmentation mask to extract the aorta and surrounding structures. We create two datasets from the Coltea-Lung dataset: one containing only the aorta and another including both the aorta and heart, enabling a detailed analysis of anatomical context. We compare our approach against baseline methods on both datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving vascular structures while enhancing contrast fidelity.

Abstract: We introduce Multimodal DuetDance (MDD), a diverse multimodal benchmark dataset designed for text-controlled and music-conditioned 3D duet dance motion generation. Our dataset comprises 620 minutes of high-quality motion capture data performed by professional dancers, synchronized with music, and detailed with over 10K fine-grained natural language descriptions. The annotations capture a rich movement vocabulary, detailing spatial relationships, body movements, and rhythm, making MDD the first dataset to seamlessly integrate human motions, music, and text for duet dance generation. We introduce two novel tasks supported by our dataset: (1) Text-to-Duet, where given music and a textual prompt, both the leader and follower dance motion are generated (2) Text-to-Dance Accompaniment, where given music, textual prompt, and the leader's motion, the follower's motion is generated in a cohesive, text-aligned manner. We include baseline evaluations on both tasks to support future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation produce visually realistic content, yet the absence of synchronized audio severely compromises immersion. To address key challenges in video-to-audio generation, including multimodal data scarcity, modality imbalance and limited audio quality in existing methods, we propose HunyuanVideo-Foley, an end-to-end text-video-to-audio framework that synthesizes high-fidelity audio precisely aligned with visual dynamics and semantic context. Our approach incorporates three core innovations: (1) a scalable data pipeline curating 100k-hour multimodal datasets through automated annotation; (2) a representation alignment strategy using self-supervised audio features to guide latent diffusion training, efficiently improving audio quality and generation stability; (3) a novel multimodal diffusion transformer resolving modal competition, containing dual-stream audio-video fusion through joint attention, and textual semantic injection via cross-attention. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HunyuanVideo-Foley achieves new state-of-the-art performance across audio fidelity, visual-semantic alignment, temporal alignment and distribution matching.

<title>Disentangling Polysemantic Neurons with a Null-Calibrated Polysemanticity Index and Causal Patch Interventions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16950</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Neural networks often contain polysemantic neurons that respond to multiple, sometimes unrelated, features, complicating mechanistic interpretability. We introduce the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a null-calibrated metric that quantifies when a neuron's top activations decompose into semantically distinct clusters. PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric cluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary semantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with Tiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into coherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers exhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach with robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and cross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs. open-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular, aligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more than non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls. PSI thus offers a principled and practical lever for discovering, quantifying, and studying polysemantic units in neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce WebSight, a vision-based autonomous web agent, designed to interact with web environments purely through visual perception, eliminating dependence on HTML or DOM-based inputs. Central to our approach we introduce our new model, WebSight-7B, a fine-tuned vision-language model optimized for UI element interaction, trained using LoRA on a web-focused subset of the Wave-UI-25K dataset. WebSight integrates this model into a modular multi-agent architecture, comprising planning, reasoning, vision-action, and verification agents, coordinated through an episodic memory mechanism.
  WebSight-7B achieves a top-1 accuracy of 58.84% on the Showdown Clicks benchmark, outperforming several larger generalist models while maintaining lower latency. The full WebSight agent achieves a 68.0% success rate on the WebVoyager benchmark, surpassing systems from labs such as OpenAI (61.0%) and HCompany (Runner H, 67.0%). Among tasks completed, WebSight answers correctly 97.14% of the time, indicating high precision. Together, WebSight and WebSight-7B establish a new standard for interpretable, robust, and efficient visual web navigation.

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometry acquisition is essential for a wide range of applications, such as computer graphics, autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, raw point clouds acquired in real-world environments are often corrupted with noise due to various factors such as sensor, lighting, material, environment etc, which reduces geometric fidelity and degrades downstream performance. Point cloud denoising is a fundamental problem, aiming to recover clean point sets while preserving underlying structures. Classical optimization-based methods, guided by hand-crafted filters or geometric priors, have been extensively studied but struggle to handle diverse and complex noise patterns. Recent deep learning approaches leverage neural network architectures to learn distinctive representations and demonstrate strong outcomes, particularly on complex and large-scale point clouds. Provided these significant advances, this survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of deep learning-based point cloud denoising methods up to August 2025. We organize the literature from two perspectives: (1) supervision level (supervised vs. unsupervised), and (2) modeling perspective, proposing a functional taxonomy that unifies diverse approaches by their denoising principles. We further analyze architectural trends both structurally and chronologically, establish a unified benchmark with consistent training settings, and evaluate methods in terms of denoising quality, surface fidelity, point distribution, and computational efficiency. Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are widely used in various applications, with density-based methods such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) being particularly prominent. These algorithms identify clusters in high-density regions while treating sparser areas as noise. However, reliance on user-defined parameters often poses optimization challenges that require domain expertise. This paper presents a novel density-based clustering method inspired by the concept of selective attention, which minimizes the need for user-defined parameters under standard conditions. Initially, the algorithm operates without requiring user-defined parameters. If parameter adjustment is needed, the method simplifies the process by introducing a single integer parameter that is straightforward to tune. The approach computes a threshold to filter out the most sparsely distributed points and outliers, forms a preliminary cluster structure, and then reintegrates the excluded points to finalize the results. Experimental evaluations on diverse data sets highlight the accessibility and robust performance of the method, providing an effective alternative for density-based clustering tasks.

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations. Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Medical imaging modalities are inherently susceptible to noise contamination that degrades diagnostic utility and clinical assessment accuracy. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for MRI brain image denoising: CNN-DAE, CADTra, and DCMIEDNet. We systematically evaluate these models across multiple Gaussian noise intensities ($\sigma = 10, 15, 25$) using the Figshare MRI Brain Dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that DCMIEDNet achieves superior performance at lower noise levels, with PSNR values of $32.921 \pm 2.350$ dB and $30.943 \pm 2.339$ dB for $\sigma = 10$ and $15$ respectively. However, CADTra exhibits greater robustness under severe noise conditions ($\sigma = 25$), achieving the highest PSNR of $27.671 \pm 2.091$ dB. All deep learning approaches significantly outperform traditional wavelet-based methods, with improvements ranging from 5-8 dB across tested conditions. This study establishes quantitative benchmarks for medical image denoising and provides insights into architecture-specific strengths for varying noise intensities.

Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have demonstrated notable efficacy in representing real-world data with hierarchical structures via exploiting the geometric properties of hyperbolic spaces characterized by negative curvatures. Curvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may cause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance. So far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not been developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of HNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via their effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived bound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the loss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,
  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized through a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit differentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by approximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and convergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation error is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding gradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from long-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our method can improve the performance of HNNs.

Abstract: Echocardiography plays a central role in cardiac imaging, offering dynamic views of the heart that are essential for diagnosis and monitoring. However, image quality can be significantly degraded by haze arising from multipath reverberations, particularly in difficult-to-image patients. In this work, we propose a semantic-guided, diffusion-based dehazing algorithm developed for the MICCAI Dehazing Echocardiography Challenge (DehazingEcho2025). Our method integrates a pixel-wise noise model, derived from semantic segmentation of hazy inputs into a diffusion posterior sampling framework guided by a generative prior trained on clean ultrasound data. Quantitative evaluation on the challenge dataset demonstrates strong performance across contrast and fidelity metrics. Code for the submitted algorithm is available at https://github.com/tristan-deep/semantic-diffusion-echo-dehazing.

While existing methods support direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to edit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography scenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating iterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal, we first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset comprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In addition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance generation coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor. Considering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable iterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a prediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the initial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated results by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music. Moreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text descriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a specifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM adaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as temporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results display music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix dataset. Code is available at https://lzvsdy.github.io/DanceEditor/.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative framework for learning shared latent representations across multimodal data. Many advanced multimodal methods focus on capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which can inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared across modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent variables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various tasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However, multimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses these challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a second-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective inference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the quality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales to many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in capturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.

Abstract: Spatial proteomics maps protein distributions in tissues, providing transformative insights for life sciences. However, current sequencing-based technologies suffer from low spatial resolution, and substantial inter-tissue variability in protein expression further compromises the performance of existing molecular data prediction methods. In this work, we introduce the novel task of spatial super-resolution for sequencing-based spatial proteomics (seq-SP) and, to the best of our knowledge, propose the first deep learning model for this task--Neural Proteomics Fields (NPF). NPF formulates seq-SP as a protein reconstruction problem in continuous space by training a dedicated network for each tissue. The model comprises a Spatial Modeling Module, which learns tissue-specific protein spatial distributions, and a Morphology Modeling Module, which extracts tissue-specific morphological features. Furthermore, to facilitate rigorous evaluation, we establish an open-source benchmark dataset, Pseudo-Visium SP, for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that NPF achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer learnable parameters, underscoring its potential for advancing spatial proteomics research. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Bokai-Zhao/NPF.

<title>Optimizing Grasping in Legged Robots: A Deep Learning Approach to Loco-Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms, excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images, depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond latency, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, making them ideal for real-time robotic perception under challenging conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and illumination changes. However, despite their advantages, synthetic event-based vision remains largely unexplored in mainstream robotics simulators. This lack of simulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic manipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source, user-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation that enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds. The package is used to investigate event-based robotic policies (ERP) for real-time navigation and manipulation. Two representative scenarios are evaluated: (1) object following with a mobile robot and (2) object detection and grasping with a robotic manipulator. Transformer-based ERPs are trained by behavior cloning and compared to RGB-based counterparts under various operating conditions. Experimental results show that event-guided policies consistently deliver competitive advantages. The results highlight the potential of event-driven perception to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing a foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy learning.

Abstract: Urban climate resilience requires more than high-resolution data; it demands systems that embed data collection, interpretation, and action within the daily lives of citizens. This chapter presents a scalable, citizen-centric framework that reimagines environmental infrastructure through participatory sensing, open analytics, and prescriptive urban planning tools. Applied in Pune, India, the framework comprises three interlinked modules: (1) a smartphone-based measurement toolkit enhanced by AI segmentation to extract tree height, canopy diameter, and trunk girth; (2) a percentile-based model using satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature to calculate localized cooling through two new metrics, Cooling Efficacy and Ambient Heat Relief; and (3) an eco-routing engine that guides mobility using a Static Environmental Quality score, based on tree density, species diversity, and cumulative carbon sequestration. Together, these modules form a closed feedback loop where citizens generate actionable data and benefit from personalized, sustainable interventions. This framework transforms open data from a passive repository into an active platform for shared governance and environmental equity. In the face of growing ecological inequality and data centralization, this chapter presents a replicable model for citizen-driven urban intelligence, reframing planning as a co-produced, climate-resilient, and radically local practice.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) with projected gradient descent is the most popular method to improve model robustness under adversarial attacks. However, computational overheads become prohibitively large when AT is applied to large backbone models. AT is also known to have the issue of robust overfitting. This paper contributes to solving both problems simultaneously towards building more trustworthy foundation models. In particular, we propose a new adapter-based approach for efficient AT directly in the feature space. We show that the proposed adapter-based approach can improve the inner-loop convergence quality by eliminating robust overfitting. As a result, it significantly increases computational efficiency and improves model accuracy by generalizing adversarial robustness to unseen attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new adapter-based approach in different backbone architectures and in AT at scale.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of BUS images is important for precise lesion delineation and tumor characterization, but is challenged by inherent artifacts and dataset inconsistencies. In this work, we evaluate the use of a modified Residual Encoder U-Net for breast ultrasound segmentation, with a focus on uncertainty quantification. We identify and correct for data duplication in the BUSI dataset, and use a deduplicated subset for more reliable estimates of generalization performance. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified using Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensembles, and their combination. Models are benchmarked on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets to demonstrate how they generalize to unseen cross-domain data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy on the Breast-Lesion-USG dataset with in-distribution validation, and provides calibrated uncertainty estimates that effectively signal regions of low model confidence. Performance declines and increased uncertainty observed in out-of-distribution evaluation highlight the persistent challenge of domain shift in medical imaging, and the importance of integrated uncertainty modeling for trustworthy clinical deployment. \footnote{Code available at: https://github.com/toufiqmusah/nn-uncertainty.git}

Abstract: Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage 2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction. Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Affordance is crucial for intelligent robots in the context of object manipulation. In this paper, we argue that affordance should be task-/instruction-dependent, which is overlooked by many previous works. That is, different instructions can lead to different manipulation regions and directions even for the same object. According to this observation, we present a new dataset comprising fifteen thousand object-instruction-affordance triplets. All scenes in the dataset are from an egocentric viewpoint, designed to approximate the perspective of a human-like robot. Furthermore, we investigate how to enable large multimodal models (LMMs) to serve as affordance predictors by implementing a ``search against verifiers'' pipeline. An LMM is asked to progressively predict affordances, with the output at each step being verified by itself during the iterative process, imitating a reasoning process. Experiments show that our method not only unlocks new instruction-oriented affordance prediction capabilities, but also achieves outstanding performance broadly.

<title>Learning to Detect Label Errors by Making Them: A Method for Segmentation and Object Detection Datasets</title>

Abstract: Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real label error detection in Cityscapes.

<title>Generative Feature Imputing - A Technique for Error-resilient Semantic Communication</title>

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving unprecedented communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G) networks by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and transmit the underlying meanings of source data. However, deploying SemCom over digital systems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against transmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature imputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial error concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature distortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a property crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the subsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a generative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to efficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we develop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error protection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic importance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions, achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) scores.

Abstract: Livestreaming has become increasingly prevalent in modern visual communication, where automatic camera quality tuning is essential for delivering superior user Quality of Experience (QoE). Such tuning requires accurate blind image quality assessment (BIQA) to guide parameter optimization decisions. Unfortunately, the existing BIQA models typically only predict an overall coarse-grained quality score, which cannot provide fine-grained perceptual guidance for precise camera parameter tuning. To bridge this gap, we first establish FGLive-10K, a comprehensive fine-grained BIQA database containing 10,185 high-resolution images captured under varying camera parameter configurations across diverse livestreaming scenarios. The dataset features 50,925 multi-attribute quality annotations and 19,234 fine-grained pairwise preference annotations. Based on FGLive-10K, we further develop TuningIQA, a fine-grained BIQA metric for livestreaming camera tuning, which integrates human-aware feature extraction and graph-based camera parameter fusion. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that TuningIQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BIQA methods in both score regression and fine-grained quality ranking, achieving superior performance when deployed for livestreaming camera tuning.

Abstract: This paper introduces a holistic perception system for internal and external monitoring of autonomous vehicles, with the aim of demonstrating a novel AI-leveraged self-adaptive framework of advanced vehicle technologies and solutions that optimize perception and experience on-board. Internal monitoring system relies on a multi-camera setup designed for predicting and identifying driver and occupant behavior through facial recognition, exploiting in addition a large language model as virtual assistant. Moreover, the in-cabin monitoring system includes AI-empowered smart sensors that measure air-quality and perform thermal comfort analysis for efficient on and off-boarding. On the other hand, external monitoring system perceives the surrounding environment of vehicle, through a LiDAR-based cost-efficient semantic segmentation approach, that performs highly accurate and efficient super-resolution on low-quality raw 3D point clouds. The holistic perception framework is developed in the context of EU's Horizon Europe programm AutoTRUST, and has been integrated and deployed on a real electric vehicle provided by ALKE. Experimental validation and evaluation at the integration site of Joint Research Centre at Ispra, Italy, highlights increased performance and efficiency of the modular blocks of the proposed perception architecture.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural scheme for the topology-aware interpolation of time-varying scalar fields. Given a time-varying sequence of persistence diagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar fields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at "inverting" the non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the corresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which learns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based on the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the non-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific topological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical and topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time, given an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach instantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input through the network. Experiments interpolating 2D and 3D time-varying datasets show our approach superiority, both in terms of data and topological fitting, with regard to reference interpolation schemes.

Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21 contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

<title>Scene-Agnostic Traversability Labeling and Estimation via a Multimodal Self-supervised Framework</title>

Abstract: Traversability estimation is critical for enabling robots to navigate across diverse terrains and environments. While recent self-supervised learning methods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the characteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works concentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths offered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust traversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and estimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and camera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability labels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging these labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different modalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse traversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based supervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally, extensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling method consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared to existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal traversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by 1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets.

Abstract: Federated learning improves data privacy and efficiency in machine learning performed over networks of distributed devices, such as mobile phones, IoT and wearable devices, etc. Yet models trained with federated learning can still fail to generalize to new devices due to the problem of domain shift. Domain shift occurs when the labeled data collected by source nodes statistically differs from the target node's unlabeled data. In this work, we present a principled approach to the problem of federated domain adaptation, which aims to align the representations learned among the different nodes with the data distribution of the target node. Our approach extends adversarial adaptation techniques to the constraints of the federated setting. In addition, we devise a dynamic attention mechanism and leverage feature disentanglement to enhance knowledge transfer. Empirically, we perform extensive experiments on several image and text classification tasks and show promising results under unsupervised federated domain adaptation setting.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on mobile devices has been demonstrated to be possible using neural models trained on data collected from the device's inertial measurement units. These models have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), Transformers or a combination of these to achieve state-of-the-art results with real-time performance. However, these approaches have not been extensively evaluated in real-world situations where the input data may be different from the training data. This paper highlights the issue of data heterogeneity in machine learning applications and how it can hinder their deployment in pervasive settings. To address this problem, we propose and publicly release the code of two sensor-wise Transformer architectures called HART and MobileHART for Human Activity Recognition Transformer. Our experiments on several publicly available datasets show that these HART architectures outperform previous architectures with fewer floating point operations and parameters than conventional Transformers. The results also show they are more robust to changes in mobile position or device brand and hence better suited for the heterogeneous environments encountered in real-life settings. Finally, the source code has been made publicly available.

Abstract: Face Restoration (FR) aims to restore High-Quality (HQ) faces from Low-Quality (LQ) input images, which is a domain-specific image restoration problem in the low-level computer vision area. The early face restoration methods mainly use statistical priors and degradation models, which are difficult to meet the requirements of real-world applications in practice. In recent years, face restoration has witnessed great progress after stepping into the deep learning era. However, there are few works to systematically study the deep learning based face restoration methods. Thus, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in deep learning techniques for face restoration. Specifically, we first summarize different problem formulations and analyze the characteristics of face images. Second, we discuss the challenges of face restoration. With regard to these challenges, we present a comprehensive review of recent FR methods, including prior-based methods and deep-learning methods. Then, we explore developed techniques in the task of FR covering network architectures, loss functions, and benchmark datasets. We also conduct a systematic benchmark evaluation on representative methods. Finally, we discuss the future directions including network designs, metrics, benchmark datasets, applications, etc. We also provide an open source repository for all the discussed methods, which is available at https://github.com/TaoWangzj/Awesome-Face-Restoration.

Abstract: Modeling dynamic, large-scale urban scenes is challenging due to their highly intricate geometric structures and unconstrained dynamics in both space and time. Prior methods often employ high-level architectural priors, separating static and dynamic elements, resulting in suboptimal capture of their synergistic interactions. To address this challenge, we present a unified representation model, called Periodic Vibration Gaussian (PVG). PVG builds upon the efficient 3D Gaussian splatting technique, originally designed for static scene representation, by introducing periodic vibration-based temporal dynamics. This innovation enables PVG to elegantly and uniformly represent the characteristics of various objects and elements in dynamic urban scenes. To enhance temporally coherent and large scene representation learning with sparse training data, we introduce a novel temporal smoothing mechanism and a position-aware adaptive control strategy respectively. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI benchmarks demonstrate that PVG surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis for both dynamic and static scenes. Notably, PVG achieves this without relying on manually labeled object bounding boxes or expensive optical flow estimation. Moreover, PVG exhibits 900-fold acceleration in rendering over the best alternative.

Abstract: Existing single image reflection removal (SIRR) methods using deep learning tend to miss key low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) differences in images, affecting their effectiveness in removing reflections. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel prompt-guided reflection removal (PromptRR) framework that uses frequency information as new visual prompts for better reflection performance. Specifically, the proposed framework decouples the reflection removal process into the prompt generation and subsequent prompt-guided restoration. For the prompt generation, we first propose a prompt pre-training strategy to train a frequency prompt encoder that encodes the ground-truth image into LF and HF prompts. Then, we adopt diffusion models (DMs) as prompt generators to generate the LF and HF prompts estimated by the pre-trained frequency prompt encoder. For the prompt-guided restoration, we integrate specially generated prompts into the PromptFormer network, employing a novel Transformer-based prompt block to effectively steer the model toward enhanced reflection removal. The results on commonly used benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/TaoWangzj/PromptRR.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has profoundly enhanced the fidelity of image generation, but it has raised concerns about copyright infringements. While prior methods have introduced adversarial perturbations to prevent style imitation, most are accompanied by the degradation of artworks' visual quality. Recognizing the importance of maintaining this, we introduce a visually improved protection method while preserving its protection capability. To this end, we devise a perceptual map to highlight areas sensitive to human eyes, guided by instance-aware refinement, which refines the protection intensity accordingly. We also introduce a difficulty-aware protection by predicting how difficult the artwork is to protect and dynamically adjusting the intensity based on this. Lastly, we integrate a perceptual constraints bank to further improve the imperceptibility. Results show that our method substantially elevates the quality of the protected image without compromising on protection efficacy.

Abstract: Generating VectorArt from text prompts is a challenging vision task, requiring diverse yet realistic depictions of the seen as well as unseen entities. However, existing research has been mostly limited to the generation of single objects, rather than comprehensive scenes comprising multiple elements. In response, this work introduces SVGCraft, a novel end-to-end framework for the creation of vector graphics depicting entire scenes from textual descriptions. Utilizing a pre-trained LLM for layout generation from text prompts, this framework introduces a technique for producing masked latents in specified bounding boxes for accurate object placement. It introduces a fusion mechanism for integrating attention maps and employs a diffusion U-Net for coherent composition, speeding up the drawing process. The resulting SVG is optimized using a pre-trained encoder and LPIPS loss with opacity modulation to maximize similarity. Additionally, this work explores the potential of primitive shapes in facilitating canvas completion in constrained environments. Through both qualitative and quantitative assessments, SVGCraft is demonstrated to surpass prior works in abstraction, recognizability, and detail, as evidenced by its performance metrics (CLIP-T: 0.4563, Cosine Similarity: 0.6342, Confusion: 0.66, Aesthetic: 6.7832). The code will be available at https://github.com/ayanban011/SVGCraft.

<title>Top-Down Guidance for Learning Object-Centric Representations</title>

Abstract: Humans' innate ability to decompose scenes into objects allows for efficient understanding, predicting, and planning. In light of this, Object-Centric Learning (OCL) attempts to endow networks with similar capabilities, learning to represent scenes with the composition of objects. However, existing OCL models only learn through reconstructing the input images, which does not assist the model in distinguishing objects, resulting in suboptimal object-centric representations. This flaw limits current object-centric models to relatively simple downstream tasks. To address this issue, we draw on humans' top-down vision pathway and propose Top-Down Guided Network (TDGNet), which includes a top-down pathway to improve object-centric representations. During training, the top-down pathway constructs guidance with high-level object-centric representations to optimize low-level grid features output by the backbone. While during inference, it refines object-centric representations by detecting and solving conflicts between low- and high-level features. We show that TDGNet outperforms current object-centric models on multiple datasets of varying complexity. In addition, we expand the downstream task scope of object-centric representations by applying TDGNet to the field of robotics, validating its effectiveness in downstream tasks including video prediction and visual planning.

Abstract: Neuron segmentation from electron microscopy (EM) volumes is crucial for understanding brain circuits, yet the complex neuronal structures in high-resolution EM images present significant challenges. EM data exhibits unique characteristics including high noise levels, anisotropic voxel dimensions, and ultra-long spatial dependencies that make traditional vision models inadequate. Inspired by autoregressive pretraining in language models, we propose TokenUnify, a hierarchical predictive coding framework that captures multi-scale dependencies through three complementary learning objectives. TokenUnify integrates random token prediction, next-token prediction, and next-all token prediction to create a comprehensive representational space with emergent properties. From an information-theoretic perspective, these three tasks are complementary and provide optimal coverage of visual data structure, with our approach reducing autoregressive error accumulation from O(K) to O(sqrt(K)) for sequences of length K. We also introduce a large-scale EM dataset with 1.2 billion annotated voxels, offering ideal long-sequence visual data with spatial continuity. Leveraging the Mamba architecture's linear-time sequence modeling capabilities, TokenUnify achieves a 44% performance improvement on downstream neuron segmentation and outperforms MAE by 25%. Our approach demonstrates superior scaling properties as model size increases, effectively bridging the gap between pretraining strategies for language and vision models.

Abstract: Images are the standard input for most computer vision algorithms. However, their processing often reduces to parallelizable operations applied locally and independently to individual pixels. Yet, many of these low-level raw pixel readings only provide redundant or noisy information for specific high-level tasks, leading to inefficiencies in both energy consumption during their transmission off-sensor and computational resources in their subsequent processing.
  As novel sensors featuring advanced in-pixel processing capabilities emerge, we envision a paradigm shift toward performing increasingly complex visual processing directly in-pixel, reducing computational overhead downstream. We advocate for synthesizing high-level cues at the pixel level, enabling their off-sensor transmission to directly support downstream tasks more effectively than raw pixel readings.
  This paper conceptualizes a novel photometric rotation estimation algorithm to be distributed at pixel level, where each pixel estimates the global motion of the camera by exchanging information with other pixels to achieve global consensus. We employ a probabilistic formulation and leverage Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) for decentralized inference using messaging-passing. The proposed proposed technique is evaluated on real-world public datasets and we offer a in-depth analysis of the practicality of applying GBP to distributed rotation estimation at pixel level.

Abstract: Grounding natural language to the physical world is a ubiquitous topic with a wide range of applications in computer vision and robotics. Recently, 2D vision-language models such as CLIP have been widely popularized, due to their impressive capabilities for open-vocabulary grounding in 2D images. Recent works aim to elevate 2D CLIP features to 3D via feature distillation, but either learn neural fields that are scene-specific and hence lack generalization, or focus on indoor room scan data that require access to multiple camera views, which is not practical in robot manipulation scenarios. Additionally, related methods typically fuse features at pixel-level and assume that all camera views are equally informative. In this work, we show that this approach leads to sub-optimal 3D features, both in terms of grounding accuracy, as well as segmentation crispness. To alleviate this, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that employs object-centric priors to eliminate uninformative views based on semantic information, and fuse features at object-level via instance segmentation masks. To distill our object-centric 3D features, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset of cluttered tabletop scenes, spawning 15k scenes from over 3300 unique object instances, which we make publicly available. We show that our method reconstructs 3D CLIP features with improved grounding capacity and spatial consistency, while doing so from single-view RGB-D, thus departing from the assumption of multiple camera views at test time. Finally, we show that our approach can generalize to novel tabletop domains and be re-purposed for 3D instance segmentation without fine-tuning, and demonstrate its utility for language-guided robotic grasping in clutter.

Abstract: Transformers have captured growing attention in computer vision, thanks to its large capacity and global processing capabilities. However, transformers are data hungry, and their ability to generalize is constrained compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets), especially when trained with limited data due to the absence of the built-in spatial inductive biases present in ConvNets. In this paper, we strive to optimally combine the strengths of both convolution and transformers for image classification tasks. Towards this end, we present a novel lightweight hybrid network that pairs Convolution with Transformers via Representation Learning Fusion and Multi-Level Feature Cross-Attention named CTRL-F. Our network comprises a convolution branch and a novel transformer module named multi-level feature cross-attention (MFCA). The MFCA module operates on multi-level feature representations obtained at different convolution stages. It processes small patch tokens and large patch tokens extracted from these multi-level feature representations via two separate transformer branches, where both branches communicate and exchange knowledge through cross-attention mechanism. We fuse the local responses acquired from the convolution path with the global responses acquired from the MFCA module using novel representation fusion techniques dubbed adaptive knowledge fusion (AKF) and collaborative knowledge fusion (CKF). Experiments demonstrate that our CTRL-F variants achieve state-of-the-art performance, whether trained from scratch on large data or even with low-data regime. For Instance, CTRL-F achieves top-1 accuracy of 82.24% and 99.91% when trained from scratch on Oxford-102 Flowers and PlantVillage datasets respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art models which showcase the robustness of our model on image classification tasks.

Abstract: The 7-point checklist (7PCL) is a widely used diagnostic tool in dermoscopy for identifying malignant melanoma by assigning point values to seven specific attributes. However, the traditional 7PCL is limited to distinguishing between malignant melanoma and melanocytic Nevi, and falls short in scenarios where multiple skin diseases with appearances similar to melanoma coexist. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diagnostic framework that integrates a clinical knowledge-based topological graph (CKTG) with a gradient diagnostic strategy featuring a data-driven weighting system (GD-DDW). The CKTG captures both the internal and external relationships among the 7PCL attributes, while the GD-DDW emulates dermatologists' diagnostic processes, prioritizing visual observation before making predictions. Additionally, we introduce a multimodal feature extraction approach leveraging a dual-attention mechanism to enhance feature extraction through cross-modal interaction and unimodal collaboration. This method incorporates meta-information to uncover interactions between clinical data and image features, ensuring more accurate and robust predictions. Our approach, evaluated on the EDRA dataset, achieved an average AUC of 88.6%, demonstrating superior performance in melanoma detection and feature prediction. This integrated system provides data-driven benchmarks for clinicians, significantly enhancing the precision of melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Large-scale models have exhibited remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including automated medical services and intelligent customer support. However, as most large models are trained on single-modality corpora, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal signals remains a significant challenge. Current research often focuses on designing task-specific or scenario-specific tuning strategies, which limits the scalability and versatility. To address this limitation, we propose a unified framework that concurrently handles multiple tasks and modalities. In this framework, all modalities and tasks are represented as unified tokens and trained using a single, consistent approach. To enable efficient multitask processing, we introduce a novel tuning strategy termed neural tuning, inspired by the concept of sparse distributed representation in the human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Furthermore, to advance research in multimodal and multitask learning, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, which includes samples annotated with multiple task labels spanning reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we demonstrate the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a streamlined and efficient manner. All models, code, and datasets will be released publicly upon publication, fostering further research and innovation in this field.

Abstract: Open-set face forgery detection poses significant security threats and presents substantial challenges for existing detection models. These detectors primarily have two limitations: they cannot generalize across unknown forgery domains and inefficiently adapt to new data. To address these issues, we introduce an approach that is both general and parameter-efficient for face forgery detection. It builds on the assumption that different forgery source domains exhibit distinct style statistics. Previous methods typically require fully fine-tuning pre-trained networks, consuming substantial time and computational resources. In turn, we design a forgery-style mixture formulation that augments the diversity of forgery source domains, enhancing the model's generalizability across unseen domains. Drawing on recent advancements in vision transformers (ViT) for face forgery detection, we develop a parameter-efficient ViT-based detection model that includes lightweight forgery feature extraction modules and enables the model to extract global and local forgery clues simultaneously. We only optimize the inserted lightweight modules during training, maintaining the original ViT structure with its pre-trained ImageNet weights. This training strategy effectively preserves the informative pre-trained knowledge while flexibly adapting the model to the task of Deepfake detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the designed model achieves state-of-the-art generalizability with significantly reduced trainable parameters, representing an important step toward open-set Deepfake detection in the wild.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit remarkable multi-tasking ability by learning mixed instruction datasets. However, novel tasks would be encountered sequentially in dynamic world, which urges for equipping LMMs with multimodal continual instruction learning (MCIT) ability especially for diverse and challenging generative tasks. Existing MCIT methods do not fully exploit the unique attribute of LMMs and often gain performance at the expense of efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning framework for MCIT to effectively alleviate forgetting of previous knowledge while managing computational complexity with natural image-text supervision. Concretely, we learn prompts for each task and exploit efficient prompt fusion for knowledge transfer and prompt selection for complexity management with dual-modality guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial +14.26% performance gain on MCIT benchmarks with remarkable $\times$ 1.42 inference speed free from growing computation.

Abstract: Simulators are indispensable for research in autonomous systems such as self-driving cars, autonomous robots, and drones. Despite significant progress in various simulation aspects, such as graphical realism, an evident gap persists between the virtual and real-world environments. Since the ultimate goal is to deploy the autonomous systems in the real world, reducing the sim2real gap is of utmost importance. In this paper, we employ a state-of-the-art approach to enhance the photorealism of simulated data, aligning them with the visual characteristics of real-world datasets. Based on this, we developed CARLA2Real, an easy-to-use, publicly available tool (plug-in) for the widely used and open-source CARLA simulator. This tool enhances the output of CARLA in near real-time, achieving a frame rate of 13 FPS, translating it to the visual style and realism of real-world datasets such as Cityscapes, KITTI, and Mapillary Vistas. By employing the proposed tool, we generated synthetic datasets from both the simulator and the enhancement model outputs, including their corresponding ground truth annotations for tasks related to autonomous driving. Then, we performed a number of experiments to evaluate the impact of the proposed approach on feature extraction and semantic segmentation methods when trained on the enhanced synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the sim2real appearance gap is significant and can indeed be reduced by the introduced approach. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art image-to-image translation approach are also provided. The tool, pre-trained models, and associated data for this work are available for download at: https://github.com/stefanos50/CARLA2Real.

Abstract: Lighting plays a pivotal role in ensuring the naturalness and aesthetic quality of video generation. However, the impact of lighting is deeply coupled with other factors of videos, e.g., objects and scenes. Thus, it remains challenging to disentangle and model coherent lighting conditions independently, limiting the flexibility to control lighting in video generation. In this paper, inspired by the established controllable T2I models, we propose LumiSculpt, which enables precise and consistent lighting control in T2V generation models. LumiSculpt equips the video generation with new interactive capabilities, allowing the input of reference image sequences with customized lighting conditions. Furthermore, the core learnable plug-and-play module of LumiSculpt facilitates direct control over the intensity, position and trajectory of an assumed light source in video diffusion models. To effectively train LumiSculpt and address the issue of insufficient lighting data, we construct LumiHuman, a new lightweight and flexible dataset for portrait lighting of images and videos. Experimental results demonstrate that LumiSculpt achieves precise and high-quality lighting control in video generation. The analysis demonstrates the flexibility of LumiHuman.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks often highlight the remarkable performance achieved by state-of-the-art Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) in leveraging temporal context for video understanding. However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.

Abstract: Current Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems have significantly enhanced 3D object detection using LiDAR and camera data. However, these methods suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions. The weather-robust 4D radar provides Doppler and additional geometric information, raising the possibility of addressing this challenge. To this end, we present V2X-R, the first simulated V2X dataset incorporating LiDAR, camera, and 4D radar. V2X-R contains 12,079 scenarios with 37,727 frames of LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds, 150,908 images, and 170,859 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline for 3D object detection and implement it with various fusion strategies. To achieve weather-robust detection, we additionally propose a Multi-modal Denoising Diffusion (MDD) module in our fusion pipeline. MDD utilizes weather-robust 4D radar feature as a condition to prompt the diffusion model to denoise noisy LiDAR features. Experiments show that our LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline demonstrates superior performance in the V2X-R dataset. Over and above this, our MDD module further improved the performance of basic fusion model by up to 5.73%/6.70% in foggy/snowy conditions with barely disrupting normal performance. The dataset and code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/ylwhxht/V2X-R.

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is a challenging task that involves translating sign language images into spoken language. For SLT models to perform this task successfully, they must bridge the modality gap and identify subtle variations in sign language components to understand their meanings accurately. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gloss-free SLT framework called Multimodal Sign Language Translation (MMSLT), which leverages the representational capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we use MLLMs to generate detailed textual descriptions of sign language components. Then, through our proposed multimodal-language pre-training module, we integrate these description features with sign video features to align them within the spoken sentence space. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily, highlighting the potential of MLLMs to be utilized effectively in SLT. Code is available at https://github.com/hwjeon98/MMSLT.

Abstract: Shadow art is a captivating form of sculptural expression where the projection of a sculpture in a specific direction reveals a desired shape with high precision. In this work, we introduce Neural Shadow Art, which leverages implicit occupancy function representation to significantly expand the possibilities of shadow art. This representation enables the design of high-quality, 3D-printable geometric models with arbitrary topologies at any resolution, surpassing previous voxel- and mesh-based methods. Our method provides a more flexible framework, enabling projections to match input binary images under various light directions and screen orientations, without requiring light sources to be perpendicular to the screens. Furthermore, we allow rigid transformations of the projected geometries relative to the input binary images and simultaneously optimize light directions and screen orientations to ensure that the projections closely resemble the target images, especially when dealing with inputs of complex topologies. In addition, our model promotes surface smoothness and reduces material usage. This is particularly advantageous for efficient industrial production and enhanced artistic effect by generating compelling shadow art that avoids trivial, intersecting cylindrical structures. In summary, we propose a more flexible representation for shadow art, significantly improving projection accuracy while simultaneously meeting industrial requirements and delivering awe-inspiring artistic effects.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction provides a comprehensive description of the surrounding scenes and has become an essential task for 3D perception. Most existing methods focus on offline perception from one or a few views and cannot be applied to embodied agents that demand to gradually perceive the scene through progressive embodied exploration. In this paper, we formulate an embodied 3D occupancy prediction task to target this practical scenario and propose a Gaussian-based EmbodiedOcc framework to accomplish it. We initialize the global scene with uniform 3D semantic Gaussians and progressively update local regions observed by the embodied agent. For each update, we extract semantic and structural features from the observed image and efficiently incorporate them via deformable cross-attention to refine the regional Gaussians. Finally, we employ Gaussian-to-voxel splatting to obtain the global 3D occupancy from the updated 3D Gaussians. Our EmbodiedOcc assumes an unknown (i.e., uniformly distributed) environment and maintains an explicit global memory of it with 3D Gaussians. It gradually gains knowledge through the local refinement of regional Gaussians, which is consistent with how humans understand new scenes through embodied exploration. We reorganize an EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the embodied 3D occupancy prediction task. Our EmbodiedOcc outperforms existing methods by a large margin and accomplishes the embodied occupancy prediction with high accuracy and efficiency. Code: https://github.com/YkiWu/EmbodiedOcc.

<title>Addressing Text Embedding Leakage in Diffusion-based Image Editing</title>

Abstract: Text-based image editing, powered by generative diffusion models, lets users modify images through natural-language prompts and has dramatically simplified traditional workflows. Despite these advances, current methods still suffer from a critical problem: attribute leakage, where edits meant for specific objects unintentionally affect unrelated regions or other target objects. Our analysis reveals the root cause as the semantic entanglement inherent in End-of-Sequence (EOS) embeddings generated by autoregressive text encoders, which indiscriminately aggregate attributes across prompts. To address this issue, we introduce Attribute-Leakage-free Editing (ALE), a framework that tackles attribute leakage at its source. ALE combines Object-Restricted Embeddings (ORE) to disentangle text embeddings, Region-Guided Blending for Cross-Attention Masking (RGB-CAM) for spatially precise attention, and Background Blending (BB) to preserve non-edited content. To quantitatively evaluate attribute leakage across various editing methods, we propose the Attribute-Leakage Evaluation Benchmark (ALE-Bench), featuring comprehensive editing scenarios and new metrics. Extensive experiments show that ALE reduces attribute leakage by large margins, thereby enabling accurate, multi-object, text-driven image editing while faithfully preserving non-target content.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at generating photorealistic images but often fail to render accurate spatial relationships. We identify two core issues underlying this common failure: 1) the ambiguous nature of data concerning spatial relationships in existing datasets, and 2) the inability of current text encoders to accurately interpret the spatial semantics of input descriptions. We propose CoMPaSS, a versatile framework that enhances spatial understanding in T2I models. It first addresses data ambiguity with the Spatial Constraints-Oriented Pairing (SCOP) data engine, which curates spatially-accurate training data via principled constraints. To leverage these priors, CoMPaSS also introduces the Token ENcoding ORdering (TENOR) module, which preserves crucial token ordering information lost by text encoders, thereby reinforcing the prompt's linguistic structure. Extensive experiments on four popular T2I models (UNet and MMDiT-based) show CoMPaSS sets a new state of the art on key spatial benchmarks, with substantial relative gains on VISOR (+98%), T2I-CompBench Spatial (+67%), and GenEval Position (+131%).

Abstract: We introduce Orchid, a unified latent diffusion model that learns a joint appearance-geometry prior to generate color, depth, and surface normal images in a single diffusion process. This unified approach is more efficient and coherent than current pipelines that use separate models for appearance and geometry. Orchid is versatile - it directly generates color, depth, and normal images from text, supports joint monocular depth and normal estimation with color-conditioned finetuning, and seamlessly inpaints large 3D regions by sampling from the joint distribution. It leverages a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that jointly encodes RGB, relative depth, and surface normals into a shared latent space, combined with a latent diffusion model that denoises these latents. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Orchid delivers competitive performance against SOTA task-specific methods for geometry prediction, even surpassing them in normal-prediction accuracy and depth-normal consistency. It also inpaints color-depth-normal images jointly, with more qualitative realism than existing multi-step methods.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been a default technique in various visual generative models, yet it requires inference from both conditional and unconditional models during sampling. We propose to build visual models that are free from guided sampling. The resulting algorithm, Guidance-Free Training (GFT), matches the performance of CFG while reducing sampling to a single model, halving the computational cost. Unlike previous distillation-based approaches that rely on pretrained CFG networks, GFT enables training directly from scratch. GFT is simple to implement. It retains the same maximum likelihood objective as CFG and differs mainly in the parameterization of conditional models. Implementing GFT requires only minimal modifications to existing codebases, as most design choices and hyperparameters are directly inherited from CFG. Our extensive experiments across five distinct visual models demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GFT. Across domains of diffusion, autoregressive, and masked-prediction modeling, GFT consistently achieves comparable or even lower FID scores, with similar diversity-fidelity trade-offs compared with CFG baselines, all while being guidance-free. Code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/GFT.

Abstract: Although LiDAR sensors have become indispensable for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their ability to provide accurate 3D scene understanding and robust perception under adverse weather conditions, the properties of LiDAR point clouds vary widely across sensor configurations and data acquisition domains, leading to severe performance degradation when models are transferred between heterogeneous sensors or from simulation to the real world. To address this challenge, we propose the Multi-view Structural Convolution Network (MSCN), a novel architecture designed to achieve domain-invariant recognition across diverse LiDAR configurations and environments. MSCN comprises Structural Convolution Layers (SCL) that extract local context geometric features from point clouds and Structural Aggregation Layers (SAL) that extract and aggregate both local and overall context features from point clouds. Furthermore, we incorporate an unseen domain generation strategy to mitigate domain gaps during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSCN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud classification methods across all domain change scenarios. These results highlight MSCN as a scalable solution for deploying LiDAR-based perception systems of AVs. Our code is available at https://github.com/MLMLab/MSCN.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

Abstract: Occupancy estimation has become a prominent task in 3D computer vision, particularly within the autonomous driving community. In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINO have led to a paradigm shift in 2D camera-based perception towards extracting generalized features to support many downstream tasks. Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy

Abstract: Advancements in AI for medical imaging offer significant potential. However, their applications are constrained by the limited availability of data and the reluctance of medical centers to share it due to patient privacy concerns. Generative models present a promising solution by creating synthetic data as a substitute for real patient data. However, medical images are typically high-dimensional, and current state-of-the-art methods are often impractical for computational resource-constrained healthcare environments. These models rely on data sub-sampling, raising doubts about their feasibility and real-world applicability. Furthermore, many of these models are evaluated on quantitative metrics that alone can be misleading in assessing the image quality and clinical meaningfulness of the generated images. To address this, we introduce MedLoRD, a generative diffusion model designed for computational resource-constrained environments. MedLoRD is capable of generating high-dimensional medical volumes with resolutions up to 512$\times$512$\times$256, utilizing GPUs with only 24GB VRAM, which are commonly found in standard desktop workstations. MedLoRD is evaluated across multiple modalities, including Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography and Lung Computed Tomography datasets. Extensive evaluations through radiological evaluation, relative regional volume analysis, adherence to conditional masks, and downstream tasks show that MedLoRD generates high-fidelity images closely adhering to segmentation mask conditions, surpassing the capabilities of current state-of-the-art generative models for medical image synthesis in computational resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Object detection models often struggle with class imbalance, where rare categories appear significantly less frequently than common ones. Existing sampling-based rebalancing strategies, such as Repeat Factor Sampling (RFS) and Instance-Aware Repeat Factor Sampling (IRFS), mitigate this issue by adjusting sample frequencies based on image and instance counts. However, these methods are based on linear adjustments, which limit their effectiveness in long-tailed distributions. This work introduces Exponentially Weighted Instance-Aware Repeat Factor Sampling (E-IRFS), an extension of IRFS that applies exponential scaling to better differentiate between rare and frequent classes. E-IRFS adjusts sampling probabilities using an exponential function applied to the geometric mean of image and instance frequencies, ensuring a more adaptive rebalancing strategy. We evaluate E-IRFS on a dataset derived from the Fireman-UAV-RGBT Dataset and four additional public datasets, using YOLOv11 object detection models to identify fire, smoke, people and lakes in emergency scenarios. The results show that E-IRFS improves detection performance by 22\% over the baseline and outperforms RFS and IRFS, particularly for rare categories. The analysis also highlights that E-IRFS has a stronger effect on lightweight models with limited capacity, as these models rely more on data sampling strategies to address class imbalance. The findings demonstrate that E-IRFS improves rare object detection in resource-constrained environments, making it a suitable solution for real-time applications such as UAV-based emergency monitoring. The code is available at: https://github.com/futurians/E-IRFS.

We developed the $\textbf{Navi-plus}$ dataset with GUI follow-up question-answer pairs, alongside a $\textbf{Dual-Stream Trajectory Evaluation}$ method to benchmark this new capability. Our results show that agents equipped with the ability to ask GUI follow-up questions can fully recover their performance when faced with ambiguous user tasks.

Abstract: Efficiently understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge in computer vision. In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our contributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we introduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset. Our code, benchmark, and models are provided in the Supplementary material.

Abstract: In autoregressive (AR) image generation, visual tokenizers compress images into compact discrete latent tokens, enabling efficient training of downstream autoregressive models for visual generation via next-token prediction. While scaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often degrades downstream generation quality -- a challenge not adequately addressed in existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first approach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and representation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing complexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs. generation dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which aligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a pre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space complexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both reconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic regularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using 1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when expanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize training for billion-scale tokenizers. By scaling to $\bf{3 \space billion}$ parameters, GigaTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction, downstream AR generation, and downstream AR representation quality.

Abstract: The accurate and efficient recognition of emotional states in oneself and others is critical, as impairments in this ability can lead to significant psychosocial difficulties. While electroencephalography (EEG) offers a powerful tool for emotion detection, current EEG-based emotion recognition (EER) methods face key limitations: insufficient model stability, limited accuracy in processing high-dimensional nonlinear EEG signals, and poor robustness against intra-subject variability and signal noise. To address these challenges, we introduce LEL (Lipschitz continuity-constrained Ensemble Learning), a novel framework that enhances EEG-based emotion recognition. By integrating Lipschitz continuity constraints, LEL ensures greater model stability and improves generalization, thereby reducing sensitivity to signal variability and noise while significantly boosting the model's overall accuracy and robustness. Its ensemble learning strategy optimizes overall performance by fusing decisions from multiple classifiers to reduce single-model bias and variance. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets (EAV, FACED and SEED) demonstrated the LEL's state-of-the-art performance, achieving average recognition accuracies of 76.43%, 83.00% and 87.22%, respectively.

Abstract: Building a generalized affordance grounding model to identify actionable regions on objects is vital for real-world applications. Existing methods to train the model can be divided into weakly and fully supervised ways. However, the former method requires a complex training framework design and can not infer new actions without an auxiliary prior. While the latter often struggle with limited annotated data and components trained from scratch despite being simpler. This study focuses on fully supervised affordance grounding and overcomes its limitations by proposing AffordanceSAM, which extends SAM's generalization capacity in segmentation to affordance grounding. Specifically, we design an affordance-adaption module and curate a coarse-to-fine annotated dataset called C2F-Aff to thoroughly transfer SAM's robust performance to affordance in a three-stage training manner. Experimental results confirm that AffordanceSAM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the AGD20K benchmark and exhibits strong generalized capacity.

Abstract: Human image animation aims to generate human videos of given characters and backgrounds that adhere to the desired pose sequence. However, existing methods focus more on human actions while neglecting the generation of background, which typically leads to static results or inharmonious movements. The community has explored camera pose-guided animation tasks, yet preparing the camera trajectory is impractical for most entertainment applications and ordinary users. As a remedy, we present an AnimateAnywhere framework, rousing the background in human image animation without requirements on camera trajectories. In particular, based on our key insight that the movement of the human body often reflects the motion of the background, we introduce a background motion learner (BML) to learn background motions from human pose sequences. To encourage the model to learn more accurate cross-frame correspondences, we further deploy an epipolar constraint on the 3D attention map. Specifically, the mask used to suppress geometrically unreasonable attention is carefully constructed by combining an epipolar mask and the current 3D attention map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AnimateAnywhere effectively learns the background motion from human pose sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance in generating human animation results with vivid and realistic backgrounds. The source code and model will be available at https://github.com/liuxiaoyu1104/AnimateAnywhere.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e., texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping). To benefit the society, the code will be available at https://github.com/hku-mars/Mesh-Learner.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of pneumonia through X-ray imaging is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled automated diagnostic tools that assist radiologists in making more reliable and efficient decisions. In this work, we propose a Singular Value Decomposition-based Least Squares (SVD-LS) framework for multi-class pneumonia classification, leveraging powerful feature representations from state-of-the-art self-supervised and transfer learning models. Rather than relying on computationally expensive gradient-based fine-tuning, we employ a closed-form, non-iterative classification approach that ensures efficiency without compromising accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SVD-LS achieves competitive performance while offering significantly reduced computational costs, making it a viable alternative for real-time medical imaging applications. The implementation is available at: github.com/meterdogan07/SVD-LS.

<title>Multimodal Masked Autoencoder Pre-training for 3D MRI-Based Brain Tumor Analysis with Missing Modalities</title>

Abstract: Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of investigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial insights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker identification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models learn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This behavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often scarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a challenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are available during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing modalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or specific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a common approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality combination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for clinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained model seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting rich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This allows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural changes, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy outperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate pre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training from scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and efficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value. Code and trained models are available at: https://github.com/Lucas-rbnt/BM-MAE

Abstract: Pain is a manifold condition that impacts a significant percentage of the population. Accurate and reliable pain evaluation for the people suffering is crucial to developing effective and advanced pain management protocols. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14 tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples. Functioning as an embedding extractor for various input modalities, the foundation model provides feature representations to the Embedding-Mixer, a transformer-based module that performs the final pain assessment. Extensive experiments employing behavioral modalities - including RGB, synthetic thermal, and estimated depth videos - and physiological modalities such as ECG, EMG, GSR, and fNIRS revealed that PainFormer effectively extracts high-quality embeddings from diverse input modalities. The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 75 different methodologies documented in the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment. The foundation model's architecture (code) and weights are available at: https://github.com/GkikasStefanos/PainFormer.

Abstract: Recent NeRF methods on large-scale scenes have underlined the importance of scene decomposition for scalable NeRFs. Although achieving reasonable scalability, there are several critical problems remaining unexplored, i.e., learnable decomposition, modeling scene heterogeneity, and modeling efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Switch-NeRF++, a Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash Experts (HMoHE) network that addresses these challenges within a unified framework. It is a highly scalable NeRF that learns heterogeneous decomposition and heterogeneous NeRFs efficiently for large-scale scenes in an end-to-end manner. In our framework, a gating network learns to decompose scenes and allocates 3D points to specialized NeRF experts. This gating network is co-optimized with the experts by our proposed Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) NeRF framework. We incorporate a hash-based gating network and distinct heterogeneous hash experts. The hash-based gating efficiently learns the decomposition of the large-scale scene. The distinct heterogeneous hash experts consist of hash grids of different resolution ranges, enabling effective learning of the heterogeneous representation of different scene parts. These design choices make our framework an end-to-end and highly scalable NeRF solution for real-world large-scale scene modeling to achieve both quality and efficiency. We evaluate our accuracy and scalability on existing large-scale NeRF datasets and a new dataset with very large-scale scenes ($>6.5km^2$) from UrbanBIS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be easily scaled to various large-scale scenes and achieve state-of-the-art scene rendering accuracy. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant efficiency, with an 8x acceleration in training and a 16x acceleration in rendering compared to Switch-NeRF. Codes will be released at https://github.com/MiZhenxing/Switch-NeRF.

Abstract: Next Best View (NBV) algorithms aim to maximize 3D scene acquisition quality using minimal resources, e.g. number of acquisitions, time taken, or distance traversed. Prior methods often rely on coverage maximization as a proxy for reconstruction quality, but for complex scenes with occlusions and finer details, this is not always sufficient and leads to poor reconstructions. Our key insight is to train an acquisition policy that directly optimizes for reconstruction quality rather than just coverage. To achieve this, we introduce the View Introspection Network (VIN): a lightweight neural network that predicts the Relative Reconstruction Improvement (RRI) of a potential next viewpoint without making any new acquisitions. We use this network to power a simple, yet effective, sequential samplingbased greedy NBV policy. Our approach, VIN-NBV, generalizes to unseen object categories, operates without prior scene knowledge, is adaptable to resource constraints, and can handle occlusions. We show that our RRI fitness criterion leads to a ~30% gain in reconstruction quality over a coverage-based criterion using the same greedy strategy. Furthermore, VIN-NBV also outperforms deep reinforcement learning methods, Scan-RL and GenNBV, by ~40%.

Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) is the capability to identify the specific regions in an image associated with a particular text description. In medical imaging, VG enhances interpretability by highlighting relevant pathological features corresponding to textual descriptions, improving model transparency and trustworthiness for wider adoption of deep learning models in clinical practice. Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with disease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate two key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background tokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the global tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local disease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and disease tokens. To address this, we introduce simple, yet effective Disease-Aware Prompting (DAP) process, which uses the explainability map of a VLM to identify the appropriate image features. This simple strategy amplifies disease-relevant regions while suppressing background interference. Without any additional pixel-level annotations, DAP improves visual grounding accuracy by 20.74% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three major chest X-ray datasets.

Abstract: Human facial images encode a rich spectrum of information, encompassing both stable identity-related traits and mutable attributes such as pose, expression, and emotion. While recent advances in image generation have enabled high-quality identity-conditional face synthesis, precise control over non-identity attributes remains challenging, and disentangling identity from these mutable factors is particularly difficult. To address these limitations, we propose a novel identity-conditional diffusion model that introduces two lightweight control modules designed to independently manipulate facial pose, expression, and emotion without compromising identity preservation. These modules are embedded within the cross-attention layers of the base diffusion model, enabling precise attribute control with minimal parameter overhead. Furthermore, our tailored training strategy, which leverages cross-attention between the identity feature and each non-identity control feature, encourages identity features to remain orthogonal to control signals, enhancing controllability and diversity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with perceptual user studies, demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of control accuracy over pose, expression, and emotion, while also improving generative diversity under identity-only conditioning.

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.

Abstract: Understanding behavior requires datasets that capture humans while carrying out complex tasks. The kitchen is an excellent environment for assessing human motor and cognitive function, as many complex actions are naturally exhibited in kitchens from chopping to cleaning. Here, we introduce the EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset, collected in a noninvasive motion capture platform inside a kitchen environment. Nine static RGB-D cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs) and one head-mounted HoloLens~2 headset were used to capture 3D hand, body, and eye movements. The EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset is a multi-view action dataset with synchronized exocentric, egocentric, depth, IMUs, eye gaze, body and hand kinematics spanning 29.7 hours of 16 subjects cooking four different recipes. Action sequences were densely annotated with 33.78 action segments per minute. Leveraging this multi-modal dataset, we propose four benchmarks to advance behavior understanding and modeling through 1) a vision-language benchmark, 2) a semantic text-to-motion generation benchmark, 3) a multi-modal action recognition benchmark, 4) a pose-based action segmentation benchmark. We expect the EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset to pave the way for better methods as well as insights to understand the nature of ecologically-valid human behavior.

Abstract: While diffusion models advance text-to-motion generation, their static semantic conditioning ignores temporal-frequency demands: early denoising requires structural semantics for motion foundations while later stages need localized details for text alignment. This mismatch mirrors biological morphogenesis where developmental phases demand distinct genetic programs. Inspired by epigenetic regulation governing morphological specialization, we propose **(ANT)**, an **A**daptive **N**eural **T**emporal-Aware architecture. ANT orchestrates semantic granularity through: **(i) Semantic Temporally Adaptive (STA) Module:** Automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency structural planning and high-frequency refinement via spectral analysis. **(ii) Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling (DCFG):** Adaptively adjusts conditional to unconditional ratio enhancing efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Extensive experiments show that ANT can be applied to various baselines, significantly improving model performance, and achieving state-of-the-art semantic alignment on StableMoFusion.

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat, the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures. These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in ophthalmology training. The dataset and annotations are publicly available in Synapse https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn66401174/files.

Abstract: Reconstructing a 3D point cloud from a given conditional sketch is challenging. Existing methods often work directly in 3D space, but domain variability and difficulty in reconstructing accurate 3D structures from 2D sketches remain significant obstacles. Moreover, ideal models should also accept prompts for control, in addition with the sparse sketch, posing challenges in multi-modal fusion. We propose DiffS-NOCS (Diffusion-based Sketch-to-NOCS Map), which leverages ControlNet with a modified multi-view decoder to generate NOCS maps with embedded 3D structure and position information in 2D space from sketches. The 3D point cloud is reconstructed by combining multiple NOCS maps from different views. To enhance sketch understanding, we integrate a viewpoint encoder for extracting viewpoint features. Additionally, we design a feature-level multi-view aggregation network as the denoising module, facilitating cross-view information exchange and improving 3D consistency in NOCS map generation. Experiments on ShapeNet demonstrate that DiffS-NOCS achieves controllable and fine-grained point cloud reconstruction aligned with sketches.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution (UHSR) Land Cover Classification is increasingly important for urban analysis, enabling fine-scale planning, ecological monitoring, and infrastructure management. It identifies land cover types on sub-meter remote sensing imagery, capturing details such as building outlines, road networks, and distinct boundaries. However, most existing methods focus on 1 m imagery and rely heavily on large-scale annotations, while UHSR data remain scarce and difficult to annotate, limiting practical applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Baltimore Atlas, a UHSR land cover classification framework that reduces reliance on large-scale training data and delivers high-accuracy results. Baltimore Atlas builds on three key ideas: (1) Baltimore Atlas Dataset, a 0.3 m resolution dataset based on aerial imagery of Baltimore City; (2) FreqWeaver Adapter, a parameter-efficient adapter that transfers SAM2 to this domain, leveraging foundation model knowledge to reduce training data needs while enabling fine-grained detail and structural modeling; (3) Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Student Framework, a semi-supervised framework that exploits unlabeled data to further reduce training dependence and improve generalization across diverse scenes. Using only 5.96% of total model parameters, our approach achieves a 1.78% IoU improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% IoU gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation methods on the Baltimore Atlas Dataset.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

Abstract: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases, and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key observation: the energy of predicted noisy samples in the reverse process continuously declines compared to perturbed samples in the forward process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and high-frequency subbands; 2) The subband energy of reverse-process reconstructed samples is consistently lower than that of forward-process ones, and both are lower than the original data samples. Based on the first finding, we introduce a dynamic frequency regulation mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we derive the rigorous mathematical form of exposure bias. It is worth noting that, our method is training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality of various diffusion models and frameworks with negligible computational cost.

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

<title>Beyond Label Semantics: Language-Guided Action Anatomy for Few-shot Action Recognition</title>

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to classify human actions in videos with only a small number of labeled samples per category. The scarcity of training data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities, particularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes. Finally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both video-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification. Experimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multipe FSAR benchmarks.

<title>Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.

Abstract: The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large and unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2) introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3) comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately, our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved diagnostic processes.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However, previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages: 1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and 2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e., Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to fuse information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr$^2$R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the fused samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr$^2$R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation.

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements. Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization.

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Most organizational data in this world are stored as documents, and visual retrieval plays a crucial role in unlocking the collective intelligence from all these documents. However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents. Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables), offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.

Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.The project page is here: https://hcplab-sysu.github.io/PhysicalAutoregressiveModel/

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to traditional upsampling methods.

Abstract: Execution monitoring is essential for robots to detect and respond to failures. Since it is impossible to enumerate all failures for a given task, we learn from successful executions of the task to detect visual anomalies during runtime. Our method learns to predict the motions that occur during the nominal execution of a task, including camera and robot body motion. A probabilistic U-Net architecture is used to learn to predict optical flow, and the robot's kinematics and 3D model are used to model camera and body motion. The errors between the observed and predicted motion are used to calculate an anomaly score. We evaluate our method on a dataset of a robot placing a book on a shelf, which includes anomalies such as falling books, camera occlusions, and robot disturbances. We find that modeling camera and body motion, in addition to the learning-based optical flow prediction, results in an improvement of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.752 to 0.804, and the area under the precision-recall curve from 0.467 to 0.549.

<title>Towards Identifiable Unsupervised Domain Translation: A Diversified Distribution Matching Approach</title>

arXiv:2401.09671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain translation (UDT) aims to find functions that convert samples from one domain (e.g., sketches) to another domain (e.g., photos) without changing the high-level semantic meaning (also referred to as ``content''). The translation functions are often sought by probability distribution matching of the transformed source domain and target domain. CycleGAN stands as arguably the most representative approach among this line of work. However, it was noticed in the literature that CycleGAN and variants could fail to identify the desired translation functions and produce content-misaligned translations. This limitation arises due to the presence of multiple translation functions -- referred to as ``measure-preserving automorphism" (MPA) -- in the solution space of the learning criteria. Despite awareness of such identifiability issues, solutions have remained elusive. This study delves into the core identifiability inquiry and introduces an MPA elimination theory. Our analysis shows that MPA is unlikely to exist, if multiple pairs of diverse cross-domain conditional distributions are matched by the learning function. Our theory leads to a UDT learner using distribution matching over auxiliary variable-induced subsets of the domains -- other than over the entire data domains as in the classical approaches. The proposed framework is the first to rigorously establish translation identifiability under reasonable UDT settings, to our best knowledge. Experiments corroborate with our theoretical claims.

Abstract: An object handover between a robot and a human is a coordinated action which is prone to failure for reasons such as miscommunication, incorrect actions and unexpected object properties. Existing works on handover failure detection and prevention focus on preventing failures due to object slip or external disturbances. However, there is a lack of datasets and evaluation methods that consider unpreventable failures caused by the human participant. To address this deficit, we present the multimodal Handover Failure Detection dataset, which consists of failures induced by the human participant, such as ignoring the robot or not releasing the object. We also present two baseline methods for handover failure detection: (i) a video classification method using 3D CNNs and (ii) a temporal action segmentation approach which jointly classifies the human action, robot action and overall outcome of the action. The results show that video is an important modality, but using force-torque data and gripper position help improve failure detection and action segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: The deep learning revolution has strongly impacted low-level image processing tasks such as style/domain transfer, enhancement/restoration, and visual quality assessments. Despite often being treated separately, the aforementioned tasks share a common theme of understanding, editing, or enhancing the appearance of input images without modifying the underlying content. We leverage this observation to develop a novel disentangled representation learning method that decomposes inputs into content and appearance features. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner and we use the learned features to develop a new quality prediction model named DisQUE. We demonstrate through extensive evaluations that DisQUE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across quality prediction tasks and distortion types. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same features may also be used for image processing tasks such as HDR tone mapping, where the desired output characteristics may be tuned using example input-output pairs.

Abstract: While large pre-trained models have achieved impressive performance across AI tasks, their deployment in privacy-sensitive and distributed environments remains challenging. Federated learning (FL) offers a viable solution by enabling decentralized fine-tuning without data sharing, but real-world applications face significant obstacles due to heterogeneous client resources in compute and memory. To address this, we propose HeteroTune, a novel federated fine-tuning paradigm for large, heterogeneous models operating under limited communication and computation budgets. The core of our method lies in a novel architecture, DeMA (Dense Mixture of Adapters), which enables flexible and efficient aggregation of heterogeneous models by preserving their full representational capacity while facilitating seamless cross-model knowledge fusion. We further introduce CMGA (Cross-Model Gradient Alignment), a lightweight yet effective mechanism that enhances training stability by harmonizing gradient directions across heterogeneous client models during aggregation, mitigating update conflicts and promoting more consistent convergence in federated settings. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence showing that HeteroTune achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across diverse tasks and model architectures. For example, on LLaMA models, it reduces communication overhead by 99.5%, cuts peak memory usage by ~50%, and improves performance by 4.61%.

Our approach is inspired by the physics of an electrical capacitor. We place source and target distributions on the capacitor plates and assign them positive and negative charges, respectively. Then we learn the electrostatic field of the capacitor using a neural network approximator. To map the distributions to each other, we start at one plate of the capacitor and move the samples along the learned electrostatic field lines until they reach the other plate. We theoretically justify that this approach provably yields the distribution transfer. In practice, we demonstrate the performance of our EFM in toy and image data experiments.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used to study vascular structures and micro-circulation dynamics in the retina and choroid. OCTA has been widely used in clinics for diagnosing ocular disease and monitoring its progression, because OCTA is safer and faster than dye-based angiography while retaining the ability to characterize micro-scale structures. However, OCTA data contains many inherent noises from the devices and acquisition protocols and suffers from various types of artifacts, which impairs diagnostic accuracy and repeatability. Deep learning (DL) based imaging analysis models are able to automatically detect and remove artifacts and noises, and enhance the quality of image data. It is also a powerful tool for segmentation and identification of normal and pathological structures in the images. Thus, the value of OCTA imaging can be significantly enhanced by the DL-based approaches for interpreting and performing measurements and predictions on the OCTA data. In this study, we reviewed literature on the DL models for OCTA images in the latest five years. In particular, we focused on discussing the current problems in the OCTA data and the corresponding design principles of the DL models. We also reviewed the state-of-art DL models for 3D volumetric reconstruction of the vascular networks and pathological structures such as the edema and distorted optic disc. In addition, the publicly available dataset of OCTA images are summarized at the end of this review. Overall, this review can provide valuable insights for engineers to develop novel DL models by utilizing the characteristics of OCTA signals and images. The pros and cons of each DL methods and their applications discussed in this review can be helpful to assist technicians and clinicians to use proper DL models for fundamental research and disease screening.

<title>FetchBot: Learning Generalizable Object Fetching in Cluttered Scenes via Zero-Shot Sim2Real</title>

Abstract: Generalizable object fetching in cluttered scenes remains a fundamental and application-critical challenge in embodied AI. Closely packed objects cause inevitable occlusions, making safe action generation particularly difficult. Under such partial observability, effective policies must not only generalize across diverse objects and layouts but also reason about occlusion to avoid collisions. However, collecting large-scale real-world data for this task remains prohibitively expensive, leaving this problem largely unsolved. In this paper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real framework for this challenge. We first curate a large-scale synthetic dataset featuring 1M diverse scenes and 500k representative demonstrations. Based on this dataset, FetchBot employs a depth-conditioned method for action generation, which leverages structural cues to enable robust obstacle-aware action planning. However, depth is perfect in simulation but noisy in real-world environments. To address this sim-to-real gap, FetchBot predicts depth from RGB inputs using a foundation model and integrates local occupancy prediction as a pre-training task, providing a generalizable latent representation for sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the strong zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, effective clutter handling, and adaptability to novel scenarios. In cluttered environments, it achieves an average real-world success rate of 89.95%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, FetchBot demonstrates excellent robustness in challenging cases, such as fetching transparent, reflective, and irregular objects, highlighting its practical value.

<title>Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images with Spatially Varying Backgrounds and Point Spread Functions</title>

arXiv:2503.00156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a type of amortized variational inference, is a computationally efficient means of constructing probabilistic catalogs of light sources from astronomical images. To date, NPE has not been used to perform inference in models with spatially varying covariates. However, ground-based astronomical images have spatially varying sky backgrounds and point spread functions (PSFs), and accounting for this variation is essential for constructing accurate catalogs of imaged light sources. In this work, we introduce a method of performing NPE with spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs. In this method, we generate synthetic catalogs and semi-synthetic images for these catalogs using randomly sampled PSF and background estimates from existing surveys. Using this data, we train a neural network, which takes an astronomical image and representations of its background and PSF as input, to output a probabilistic catalog. Our experiments with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data demonstrate the effectiveness of NPE in the presence of spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs for light source detection, star/galaxy separation, and flux measurement.

Abstract: Real-world household tasks present significant challenges for mobile manipulation robots. An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that successful task performance hinges on three key whole-body control capabilities: bimanual coordination, stable and precise navigation, and extensive end-effector reachability. Achieving these capabilities requires careful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity further complicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, we introduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies. We evaluate BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces. We believe that BRS's integrated robotic embodiment, data collection interface, and learning framework mark a significant step toward enabling real-world whole-body manipulation for everyday household tasks. BRS is open-sourced at https://behavior-robot-suite.github.io/

<title>Supervising 3D Talking Head Avatars with Analysis-by-Audio-Synthesis</title>

Abstract: In order to be widely applicable, speech-driven 3D head avatars must articulate their lips in accordance with speech, while also conveying the appropriate emotions with dynamically changing facial expressions. The key problem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without rich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but with lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic model with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on the following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it should be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred speech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create a novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate lip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under Neural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar framework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable sound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses audio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a diffusion-based talking avatar framework. During training, the mesh-to-speech model takes the generated animation and produces a sound that is compared to the input speech, creating a differentiable analysis-by-audio-synthesis supervision loop. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that THUNDER significantly improves the quality of the lip-sync of talking head avatars while still allowing for generation of diverse, high-quality, expressive facial animations. The code and models will be available at https://thunder.is.tue.mpg.de/

Abstract: Movie Dubbing aims to convert scripts into speeches that align with the given movie clip in both temporal and emotional aspects while preserving the vocal timbre of a given brief reference audio. Existing methods focus primarily on reducing the word error rate while ignoring the importance of lip-sync and acoustic quality. To address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM) based flow matching architecture for dubbing, named FlowDubber, which achieves high-quality audio-visual sync and pronunciation by incorporating a large speech language model and dual contrastive aligning while achieving better acoustic quality via the proposed voice-enhanced flow matching than previous works. First, we introduce Qwen2.5 as the backbone of LLM to learn the in-context sequence from movie scripts and reference audio. Then, the proposed semantic-aware learning focuses on capturing LLM semantic knowledge at the phoneme level. Next, dual contrastive aligning (DCA) boosts mutual alignment with lip movement, reducing ambiguities where similar phonemes might be confused. Finally, the proposed Flow-based Voice Enhancing (FVE) improves acoustic quality in two aspects, which introduces an LLM-based acoustics flow matching guidance to strengthen clarity and uses affine style prior to enhance identity when recovering noise into mel-spectrograms via gradient vector field prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two primary benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from basic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate human-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs; \textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs. Building on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a structured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers practitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure Computer-Using Agents.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

Abstract: Interpreting figurative language such as sarcasm across multi-modal inputs presents unique challenges, often requiring task-specific fine-tuning and extensive reasoning steps. However, current Chain-of-Thought approaches do not efficiently leverage the same cognitive processes that enable humans to identify sarcasm. We present IRONIC, an in-context learning framework that leverages Multi-modal Coherence Relations to analyze referential, analogical and pragmatic image-text linkages. Our experiments show that IRONIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection across different baselines. This demonstrates the need for incorporating linguistic and cognitive insights into the design of multi-modal reasoning strategies. Our code is available at: https://github.com/aashish2000/IRONIC

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has empowered modern AI systems to comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level performance in specific domains. However, these models are fundamentally constrained by \emph{catastrophic forgetting}, \ie~a persistent challenge where models experience performance degradation on previously learned tasks when adapting to new tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative AI in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative AI models, encompassing large language models, multimodal large language models, vision-language-action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, thereby providing deeper insights into the field.

Abstract: Neural signed-distance fields (SDFs) are a versatile backbone for neural geometry representation, but enforcing CAD-style developability usually requires Gaussian-curvature penalties with full Hessian evaluation and second-order differentiation, which are costly in memory and time. We introduce an off-diagonal Weingarten loss that regularizes only the mixed shape operator term that represents the gap between principal curvatures and flattens the surface. We present two variants: a finite-difference version using six SDF evaluations plus one gradient, and an auto-diff version using a single Hessian-vector product. Both converge to the exact mixed term and preserve the intended geometric properties without assembling the full Hessian. On the ABC benchmarks the losses match or exceed Hessian-based baselines while cutting GPU memory and training time by roughly a factor of two. The method is drop-in and framework-agnostic, enabling scalable curvature-aware SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction. Our code is available at https://flatcad.github.io/.

Abstract: We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.

Abstract: Data-hungry neuro-AI modelling requires ever larger neuroimaging datasets. CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide set of semantic concepts using well-characterized images in a new densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative (THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories. We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis presents unique challenges due to the inherent complexity and high-resolution details required in clinical contexts. Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification, showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation, particularly in low-data regimes. Our code is accessible through the project website - https://tehraninasab.github.io/pixelperfect-megamed.

Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types. Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study, we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures, with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks, including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis, thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its clinical applicability.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images, limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.

Summary:
NSegment+ is a novel augmentation framework introduced in this study to address subtle label imperfections in image segmentation. The method decouples image and label transformations to enhance model performance. By applying controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels, NSegment+ encourages models to learn robust representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on various datasets show consistent improvements in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores. NSegment+ achieves mIoU gains of up to +3.39 on PASCAL VOC, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit label noise. When combined with other training techniques such as CutMix and Label Smoothing, the performance gains can be further amplified. This study underscores the significance of addressing realistic noise in image segmentation tasks to improve model generalization capacity and overall performance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit) label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present, such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

<div> Keyword: generative model, 3D hand motions, natural language descriptions, sign language dataset, HandMDM <br />
Summary: 
This article introduces a new approach to training a generative model of 3D hand motions based on natural language descriptions. The authors use a large-scale sign language video dataset and translate noisy pseudo-annotations into hand motion descriptions using a language model that incorporates a dictionary of sign attributes and motion-script cues. This data enables the training of a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model, HandMDM, which can generate hand motions based on textual input. The model is robust across domains, including unseen sign categories from the same sign language, different sign languages, and non-sign hand movements. The authors conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the model's performance in various scenarios. They also plan to release their trained models and data to support further research in this emerging field. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to support future research in this relatively new field.

Summary:
This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR, a framework for fine-grained action recognition in long-term videos. It utilizes a Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) to efficiently transform raw video into visual event sequences, which are then processed by an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module adapted using Prompt Tuning. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets, surpassing existing methods. Ablation studies confirm the importance of VTEM's components and the effectiveness of Prompt Tuning. Human evaluations show the interpretability of visual event representations. This work demonstrates the potential of LVLMs for robust and interpretable video action understanding through efficient model adaptation and video-to-language translation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR (Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences" through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module, specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods (e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning, while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

<br />
Summary: PathPT is introduced as a framework to improve the diagnostic accuracy of rare cancers by leveraging vision-language pathology models and multi-instance learning techniques. It addresses limitations in current methods by incorporating spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific prompt tuning, allowing for fine-grained tile-level guidance based on histopathological semantics. PathPT outperforms existing models in subtyping accuracy and cancerous region grounding ability across various rare cancer datasets. This advancement in AI-assisted diagnosis offers a scalable solution for improving diagnostic accuracy in settings with limited access to specialized expertise. <div>

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology, where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL) foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited. Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features, overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics. We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

AutoCattloger, Cattlog, and CowFinder are components of a new automated video system for cataloging and identifying cows in a dairy herd. The system is designed to work with a single input video clip per cow and can identify individuals in continuous video streams without using deep learning. By utilizing the eidetic cow recognizer, the system is able to identify cows in unlabeled and unsegmented video footage, specifically in the holding area of a milking parlor where cows are walking freely. This hands-free system offers a valuable solution for dairy farmers looking to track and manage their herd without the need for manual cataloging or identification processes. The innovative approach presented in this work demonstrates the potential for automated video systems to revolutionize the way dairy herds are monitored and managed.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

We demonstrate its value in finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

<div> adaptation, vision-language models, fine-grained classification, renal pathology, few-shot learning

Summary: 
Vision-language models (VLMs) are being explored for fine-grained glomerular classification in renal pathology, a challenging task due to subtle morphological variations among subtypes. The Glo-VLMs framework leverages pathology images and clinical text prompts to facilitate joint representation learning. Various VLM architectures and adaptation strategies were assessed under a few-shot learning paradigm to understand their impact on model performance. Despite limited labeled data, fine-tuning VLMs achieved high accuracy, macro-AUC, and F1-score, demonstrating effective adaptation for medical image classification even with minimal supervision. This research clarifies the potential of large pretrained models for specialized clinical applications. <div>
arXiv:2508.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained, disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics, aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained medical image classification.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality, spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning for real-world applications.

Summary:
The paper discusses the efficient use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for monitoring marine litter using UAVs. Unlike satellite images, UAVs offer higher resolution and better adaptability in local areas. However, traditional CNN models struggle with the heterogeneous nature of beach sand, leading to inaccurate inferences. To address this, the paper proposes utilizing instance-based segmentation and panoptic segmentation methods, which exhibit high accuracy with minimal samples. These models prove to be more robust and less susceptible to environmental factors such as sand color reflections, human activity, shadows, and natural elements like algae and dunes. By incorporating these advanced CNN-based segmentation techniques, the monitoring of marine litter can be significantly improved, aiding in the global efforts to combat this environmental challenge.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images, making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks. For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers. To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset. This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach to Sign Language Production (SLP) that leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to create photorealistic digital avatars from reference images. The proposed method includes a sign feature aggregation module that explicitly models non-manual features (such as facial expressions) and manual features (such as hand movements). This module ensures the preservation of linguistic content while incorporating diversity by using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds. Experiments conducted on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset demonstrate that the proposed pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to existing methods, with significant improvements in perceptual metrics. Overall, the approach addresses the challenge of capturing diversity in sign representation while maintaining visual quality and accurately modeling non-manual attributes like emotions.

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions, and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands). We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling, DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones, including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27 FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration, streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

The framework achieves improved detection performance, especially with middle fusion and intensity encoding, showing up to 9 times higher mean Average Precision at IoU 0.9 compared to single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP establishes a benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception, highlighting the benefits of radar sharing for enhanced detection robustness. The dataset and code are publicly available to facilitate further research. <br />  <div>

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse, noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further research.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM) integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features to improve anomaly detection and localization in industrial images. By applying DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers and selecting specific frequency subbands, WE-PaDiM enhances feature selection based on relevant frequency content. Evaluations on the MVTec AD dataset with various backbones show strong performance in anomaly detection and localization. The method achieves high Image-AUC and Pixel-AUC scores across 15 categories with optimized configurations. Analysis reveals that wavelet choices impact performance trade-offs, with simpler wavelets and detail subbands enhancing localization, while approximation bands improve image-level detection. WE-PaDiM offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to random feature selection in PaDiM, delivering robust results suitable for industrial inspection efficiently. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework. This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32% Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH) often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Summary:
ERA is a new knowledge distillation method that aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale teacher model to a lightweight student model more effectively by decomposing the residual knowledge into multiple steps. It utilizes a Multi-Branched Residual Network (MBRNet) to achieve this decomposition and introduces a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy to address the capacity disparity between teacher and student models.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge, motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps, reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition. Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights. Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology, livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally, 3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for future research.

arXiv:2508.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing, which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions, submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1) diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization, highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7 mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies, leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20 anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted precision oncology.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing}, SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive generative adversarial network (MSPG-SEN) for GAN models. This paper has four contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN has achieved state-of-the-art generation results on the following five datasets,INKK The dataset is 89.7\%,AWUN The dataset is 78.3\%,IONJ The dataset is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow dynamic residual network(). After ablation experiments, it can effectively improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability, with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local information, improve feature separation capability and feature expression capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK With strong cross-task capability.

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components: adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data, feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels, DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic, weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from 2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging, offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics, and personalized orthopedic care.

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test (TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information. Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal cell detection.

The paper introduces Adaptive Prompt Tuning (APT), a novel framework for anomaly detection using Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). APT overcomes limitations of traditional prompt-based methods by self-generating anomaly samples with noise perturbations for few-shot learning. The system trains learnable prompts to capture context-specific anomalies in various scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) is proposed to align prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse synthetic anomalies. APT not only improves pixel-wise anomaly detection but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets without the need for human-designed prompts. This approach establishes a robust and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding. In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Experimental results on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the RAGSR method. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution (SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism, our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing approaches.

Summary: This study introduces a novel heterogeneous network design to address the over-semantic homogenization issue in meta-learning. By utilizing heterogeneous visual aggregation (HA) modules and heterogeneous transfer (HT) module, the proposed model enhances complementarity while preserving semantic commonality. The inclusion of heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information further boosts the generalization capability of multimodal models. In weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, the proposed TLG model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models with significantly fewer parameters. Specifically, TLG achieves a 13.2% improvement on Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7% improvement on COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. Remarkably, TLG is the first weakly supervised model to surpass fully supervised models under the same backbone architectures. The code for the model is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs, characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module. Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a challenging task in Video Object Segmentation (VOS). Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) faces the additional difficulty of finding initial object segmentation, leading to uncertainty in object proposals. The proposed Frequent Temporally Integrated Objects (FTIO) framework addresses these challenges by implementing a combined criterion for improved object selection and correcting temporal inconsistencies through a three-stage method. This approach enhances object selection, especially for small or complex objects, and integrates missing object mask regions to improve overall performance in multi-object UVOS. Experimental results demonstrate that FTIO achieves superior performance, making it a promising solution for real-world VOS applications. <div>

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects, which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components. First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection, mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects. Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is available at: https://github.com/MohammadMohammadzadehKalati/FTIO

<div> Keywords: Video large language models, Speculative decoding, Video token pruning, Efficient speculation, Video understanding benchmarks

Summary:
SpecVLM is a new speculative decoding framework designed for Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) to improve efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Extensive experiments on various video understanding benchmarks show that SpecVLM achieves significant decoding speedup, with up to 2.68$\times$ speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for Qwen2.5-VL-32B. Overall, SpecVLM demonstrates effectiveness and robustness in accelerating the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs while preserving the quality of video content understanding. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- SpecVLM introduces a training-free speculative decoding framework for Vid-LLMs. 
- It enables efficient speculation through video token pruning, reducing memory and computational overhead.
- SpecVLM performs a two-stage pruning process guided by attention signals from a verifier model.
- Extensive experiments show significant decoding speedup on video understanding benchmarks.
- The framework achieves up to 2.68$\times$ speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for Qwen2.5-VL-32B. <div>

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD) framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning. Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens, enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this, it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner. Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$ decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

<div> Keywords: driver monitoring, deep learning, perspective, adaptation, video

Summary:<br /><br />

The study explores the challenge of adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring when faced with changes in camera perspective. Different probing strategies and foundation models, including DINOv2 and CLIP, are evaluated for their effectiveness in handling unseen viewpoints without further adaptation. A new method called T-Mask is introduced, which leverages temporal token masking to improve cross-view accuracy without adding parameters. The results show that T-Mask outperforms strong probing baselines and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, particularly benefiting underrepresented secondary activities. This research demonstrates the potential of lightweight probing methods in enhancing fine-grained driver observation, especially in cross-view and low-data settings. The importance of temporal token selection in leveraging foundation models for building robust driver monitoring systems is highlighted. Code and models for T-Mask are available to support further research endeavors. <div>

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring. While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers ('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes, advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning. Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&amp;Act dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and $+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like \textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation, especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

<div> ODE, feature caching, acceleration, image generation, video generation

Summary:
FoCa introduces a new approach to feature caching in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to improve efficiency in image and video generation tasks. By treating feature caching as a feature-ODE solving problem, FoCa enables robust integration of historical features under large skipping intervals. This method significantly enhances acceleration ratios while maintaining high generation quality. Experimental results across various tasks show FoCa's effectiveness, achieving near-lossless speedups on FLUX, HunyuanVideo, Inf-DiT, and DiT without additional training. FoCa demonstrates superior performance compared to existing caching strategies, especially under aggressive acceleration scenarios. The approach not only reduces computational costs but also ensures stable generation quality in high-speed inference scenarios, making it a promising technique for accelerating high-fidelity image and video generation models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps. However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE. We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, Transformer architectures, generative tasks, caching strategies, real-time deployment 

Summary: 
OmniCache introduces a training-free acceleration method for diffusion models, addressing the high computational cost associated with Transformer architectures in generative tasks. By strategically distributing cache reuse across the entire sampling process and dynamically estimating noise during cache reuse, OmniCache enhances efficiency while maintaining generative quality. The approach differs from existing methods by focusing on sampling trajectories of DIT models and utilizing cached computations effectively throughout the diffusion trajectory. Experimental results show that OmniCache accelerates the sampling process and offers a practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models. <div>
arXiv:2508.16212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the MedOmni-45 Degrees benchmark and workflow to evaluate the reliability and safety-performance trade-offs of large language models (LLMs) used in medical decision-support. This benchmark focuses on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfulness, sycophancy, and manipulative hint conditions. It includes 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across six specialties, evaluated using seven LLMs. The benchmark combines three metrics - Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and Anti-Sycophancy - into a composite score visualized on a 45 Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B model performs closest to a balanced safety and accuracy score. MedOmni-45 Degrees aims to expose reasoning vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guide the development of safer models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts -- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness. Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source, general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45 Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81 Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45 Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

<div> Adversarial Protection, Diffusion-based Inpainting Models, PromptFlare, Cross-Attention Mechanism, Unauthorized Image Manipulations

Summary:
PromptFlare is a new method designed to protect images from unauthorized modifications using diffusion-based inpainting models. It leverages the cross-attention mechanism to target shared, invariant token prompts, injecting noise to divert the model's focus and neutralize the effect of prompts. This approach outperforms previous methods by achieving state-of-the-art performance on the EditBench dataset while reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. By exploiting prompt embeddings, PromptFlare effectively prevents malicious actors from manipulating images while maintaining high-quality results. The code for PromptFlare is available on GitHub, providing a robust and efficient solution to safeguard against potential misuse of diffusion models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However, these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process. The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at https://github.com/NAHOHYUN-SKKU/PromptFlare.

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision, powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.

It focuses on aligning semantics between the modalities of the output by implementing modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict textual input and attention-based cross-modality fusion for semantic enhancement. The model also features modality semantic creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) to enhance writing creativity by utilizing rejected samples. Additionally, a dataset called ArtMUSE, consisting of around 3k text-image pairs, is introduced to advance MMCW research. FlexMUSE demonstrates promising results in terms of consistency, creativity, and coherence, showcasing its potential for enhancing multi-modal generative tasks.

arXiv:2508.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles. Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work, we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover, to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results, demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091 high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

Summary: 
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) play a critical role in improving human-computer interaction, particularly in graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring. However, MLLMs face challenges in accurately generating UI element coordinates due to the semantic gap in representing numerical UI coordinates in language spaces. To address this, the study introduces an IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training approach that incorporates IoU-based coordinate sampling to enhance training data and mitigate exposure bias. The novel pipeline for data augmentation significantly improves MLLMs' performance in generating UI element coordinates, crucial for GUI understanding. Experimental results validate the superiority of the IAML training approach over traditional methods, showcasing its potential to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs in processing user instructions based on screen contents. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring, where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents. Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates. This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges: limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects (e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/ucas-dlg/IRSAMap

We propose a novel deep learning solution based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for heightened sensitivity. A key achievement is the ability to detect small plumes down to 400 m2 (i.e., for a single pixel at 20 m resolution), surpassing traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

<div> Keywords: Figure skating, Technical Element Score, Program Component Score, Mamba pyramid network, Action quality assessment 

Summary: 
The article proposes a novel approach for predicting Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) in figure skating competitions. The challenges faced by existing methods are addressed by a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with judging criteria. The network separates the visual-feature based TES evaluation stream from the audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. A multi-level fusion mechanism is introduced in the PCS evaluation stream to enhance scoring by fusing visual and auditory cues. The TES evaluation stream utilizes a multi-scale Mamba pyramid and TES head to effectively localize and evaluate action elements with various temporal scales. The method is efficient in handling lengthy competition videos, capturing long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Overall, the proposed framework provides accurate predictions for TES and PCS in figure skating competitions.

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges. Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark.

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection. Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent, outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents. This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale, enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

Summary: 
The article introduces the MM-ORIENT framework for multimodal learning, addressing noise within individual modalities. It utilizes cross-modal relation graphs to reconstruct monomodal features for acquiring multimodal representations without explicit interactions, reducing noise effects. The Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA) component focuses on important information within each modality, aiding in multitasking by learning discriminative features before fusion. The framework effectively comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks, as demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets. <div>

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal representations, especially when these representations are obtained through explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities. To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities, reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA) to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

Summary: Transformer models with Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) face challenges like high computational complexity and memory demands, hindering deployment at the edge. This study proposes an approach called Entropy Attention Maps (EAM) to accelerate model inference by freezing and quantizing low-entropy attention maps. Analysis based on Shannon entropy indicates that low-entropy attention heads contribute less information, leading to targeted compression strategies. EAM achieves comparable or higher accuracy with less than or equal to 20% sparsity in attention maps on ImageNet-1k dataset. The approach shows competitive performance even beyond 20% sparsity for Transformer models like DeiT and Swin. This work highlights the potential of leveraging information redundancy in attention maps to optimize Transformer model efficiency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer models.

<div> Keywords: vision encoders, image size agnostic, task-driven, efficiency, computational complexity

Summary: 
Vision encoders of the future should prioritize task-driven approaches over fixed image sizes, drawing inspiration from the efficiency seen in biological vision. The focus should be on adapting computational complexity based on the specific task at hand rather than the sheer size of the image. Nature demonstrates the ability to efficiently process vast amounts of visual data by dynamically allocating energy based on task requirements. This approach contrasts with current vision encoders that lack such adaptability. A proof-of-concept solution for image classification showcases the feasibility and potential of this task-driven, dynamic approach. This shift towards task-driven vision encoders holds promise for improving efficiency and effectiveness in processing visual data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification. Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

<div> Keywords: Randomized Time Warping, self-attention mechanism, Transformers, motion recognition, Dynamic Time Warping 

Summary: 
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) has been identified as a form of self-attention mechanism, similar to that used in Transformers for motion recognition tasks. While RTW is an extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for matching sequential patterns, it focuses on identifying optimal contribution weights for each element in the input sequence to generate discriminative features. Despite differences in operation, RTW and self-attention weights exhibit high correlation. RTW attention processes the entire input sequence, while self-attention focuses on a local subset due to computational constraints. This distinction gives RTW an edge over Transformers, as evidenced by a 5% performance boost on the Something-Something V2 dataset. <div>
arXiv:2508.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different, these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the Something-Something V2 dataset.

Existing deep learning methods suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their deployment in industrial environments. GMBINet addresses these challenges by enhancing multiscale feature extraction and interaction through Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI) modules. These modules ensure scale-agnostic computational complexity and improve cross-scale interaction without introducing additional overhead. Experiments show that GMBINet achieves competitive accuracy with real-time speeds on both GPU and CPU. Evaluations on the NEU-CLS dataset demonstrate its strong generalization ability, indicating potential for broader industrial vision applications. The dataset and code for GMBINet are publicly available for further research and development. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However, these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI) modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters. Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/zhangyongcode/GMBINet.

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots, enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances and challenging foggy scenes.

Summary: 

HAMSt3R is introduced as an extension of MASt3R for recovering joint human and scene 3D geometry from sparse, uncalibrated multi-view images. It utilizes DUNE, an image encoder incorporating knowledge from scene geometry and human body estimation models. HAMSt3R includes network heads for segmenting people, predicting dense correspondences, and estimating depth in human-centric environments to achieve comprehensive 3D reconstruction. The method generates a dense point map with human semantic information in 3D, efficiently without complex optimization pipelines. Evaluation on challenging benchmarks shows effective human reconstruction and strong performance in general 3D tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene understanding in 3D vision. <div>

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse, uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D, two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios. Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene understanding in 3D vision.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen object categories.

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for 3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales, while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed, increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection (OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection, zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs. Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections. This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts. Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues, enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent, challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.

Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has emerged as a promising alternative to Vector Quantization (VQ) in neural compression, offering simplified training and improved stability. However, naive application of FSQ in residual quantization frameworks suffers from the \textbf{residual magnitude decay problem}, where subsequent FSQ layers receive progressively weaker signals, severely limiting their effectiveness. We propose \textbf{Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)}, a general framework that addresses this fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our approach maintains the simplicity of FSQ while enabling effective multi-stage residual quantization. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that RFSQ variants significantly outperform strong baselines including VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ, achieving up to 45\% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7\% reduction in L1 reconstruction error. The proposed LayerNorm strategy shows the most consistent improvements across different configurations, establishing RFSQ as a superior quantization method for neural compression.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However, acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available, we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent 3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy imaging of unstained live cells remains a persistent challenge due to low contrast, temporal changes in specimen phenotypes, irregular illumination, and the absence of training labels. While deep learning (DL) methods (e.g., Cellpose 3.0) achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, they require extensive labeled data and heavy computational resources, and they often fail under uneven illumination. We present the first unsupervised segmentation framework combining spatial standard deviation from local mean (SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) to address these limitations. Unlike deep learning models, our approach requires no annotations or retraining and operates through a user-friendly GUI tailored for non-programming users. The robustness and generality were validated on three datasets, including cross-domain data. We benchmark our method against 2023--2024 SOTA models, including Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist, using a dataset of unstained myoblast images. Our method achieves a significant improvement in segmentation performance, with an IoU increase of up to 48\% and statistically validated superiority ($p < 0.01$, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Expert evaluation from two biologists further supports the segmentation quality (Cohen's $\kappa > 0.75$). The proposed algorithm is lightweight, interpretable, and computationally efficient, offering a practical and effective alternative for cell segmentation in label-free microscopy. The code, the dataset, and the results are available for reproducibility*.

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website: https://joehjhuang.github.io/gelslam.

Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96, F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly accessible datasets (TCGA and CBIS-DDSM).

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate identification of ischemic stroke lesion boundaries from imaging is critical for diagnosis and treatment. The main imaging modalities used include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and computed tomography (CT)-based techniques such as non-contrast CT (NCCT), contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP). DWI is the gold standard for the identification of lesions but has limited applicability in low-resource settings due to prohibitive costs. CT-based imaging is currently the most practical imaging method in low-resource settings due to low costs and simplified logistics, but lacks the high specificity of MRI-based methods in monitoring ischemic insults. Supervised deep learning methods are the leading solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation and provide an opportunity to improve diagnostic quality in low-resource settings by incorporating insights from DWI when segmenting from CT. Here, we develop a series of models which use CT images taken upon arrival as inputs to predict follow-up lesion volumes annotated from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Furthermore, we implement clinically motivated preprocessing steps and show that the proposed pipeline results in a 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds compared to a nnU-Net model trained with the baseline preprocessing. Finally, we demonstrate that through additional preprocessing of CTA maps to extract vessel segmentations, we further improve our best model by 21% over 5 folds.

Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on the DFASR framework, we introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low- and high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to 1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of roughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our RTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX 4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on higher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together, our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics applications.

Abstract: Sign Language (SL) enables two-way communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, yet many sign languages remain under-resourced in the AI space. Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures, promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and advancement in SL learning systems for the under-resourced communities.

<title>Lightweight and Fast Real-time Image Enhancement via Decomposition of the Spatial-aware Lookup Tables</title>

Abstract: The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis. Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition (SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end multimodal conversational systems.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&amp;E virtual staining, enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&amp;E) of the same tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion, potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

Abstract: Non-destructive 3D imaging of large multi-particulate samples is essential for quantifying particle-level properties, such as size, shape, and spatial distribution, across applications in mining, materials science, and geology. However, accurate instance segmentation of particles in tomographic data remains challenging due to high morphological variability and frequent particle contact, which limit the effectiveness of classical methods like watershed algorithms. While supervised deep learning approaches offer improved performance, they rely on extensive annotated datasets that are labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. In this work, we propose self-validated learning, a novel self-training framework for particle instance segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations. Our method leverages implicit boundary detection and iteratively refines the training set by identifying particles that can be consistently matched across reshuffled scans of the same sample. This self-validation mechanism mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust learning from unlabeled data. After just three iterations, our approach accurately segments over 97% of the total particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in tomographic scans of quartz fragments. Importantly, the framework also enables fully autonomous model evaluation without the need for ground truth annotations, as confirmed through comparisons with state-of-the-art instance segmentation techniques. The method is integrated into the Biomedisa image analysis platform (https://github.com/biomedisa/biomedisa/).

Abstract: Patients undergoing a mechanical thrombectomy procedure usually have a multi-detector CT (MDCT) scan before and after the intervention. The image quality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention room is generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts. However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patient would not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated the potential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved by acquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT. This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to improve the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans. Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnostic purposes using a questionnaire. The DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection, provided that the input FDCT image quality is not too low. Our code can be found on github.

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example, they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology, and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge, complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

Abstract: Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly aggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their rapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical biomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the alkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation status using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven contrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This study introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status Prediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to enhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first, generating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively captures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different MRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a convolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The adaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as contrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI image synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures across all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the CAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.

Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However, existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics. Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings.

Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning model development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing and classification pipeline on a microcontroller. After a short review on TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at 15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex M4F microcontroller, serving as a reference for future TinyML process monitoring solutions.

<title>Time-Aware One Step Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder, which projects the same image into different latent features based on timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features, the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results with only a single step.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications. Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled, high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors. In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866 CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726, representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.

Abstract: We present a new generalizable NeRF method that is able to directly generalize to new unseen scenarios and perform novel view synthesis with as few as two source views. The key to our approach lies in the explicitly modeled correspondence matching information, so as to provide the geometry prior to the prediction of NeRF color and density for volume rendering. The explicit correspondence matching is quantified with the cosine similarity between image features sampled at the 2D projections of a 3D point on different views, which is able to provide reliable cues about the surface geometry. Unlike previous methods where image features are extracted independently for each view, we consider modeling the cross-view interactions via Transformer cross-attention, which greatly improves the feature matching quality. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on different evaluation settings, with the experiments showing a strong correlation between our learned cosine feature similarity and volume density, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer the tantalising prospect of unified information processing across visual and textual domains due to the lack of inherent inductive biases in ViTs. ViTs require enormous datasets for training. We introduce an innovative ensemble-based distillation approach that distils inductive bias from complementary lightweight teacher models to make their applications practical. Prior systems relied solely on convolution-based teaching. However, this method incorporates an ensemble of light teachers with different architectural tendencies, such as convolution and involution, to jointly instruct the student transformer. Because of these unique inductive biases, instructors can accumulate a wide range of knowledge, even from readily identifiable stored datasets, which leads to enhanced student performance. Our proposed framework LIB-KD also involves precomputing and keeping logits in advance, essentially the unnormalized predictions of the model. This optimisation can accelerate the distillation process by eliminating the need for repeated forward passes during knowledge distillation, significantly reducing the computational burden and enhancing efficiency.

Abstract: Low-Light Enhancement (LLE) is aimed at improving the quality of photos/videos captured under low-light conditions. It is worth noting that most existing LLE methods do not take advantage of geometric modeling. We believe that incorporating geometric information can enhance LLE performance, as it provides insights into the physical structure of the scene that influences illumination conditions. To address this, we propose a Geometry-Guided Low-Light Enhancement Refine Framework (GG-LLERF) designed to assist low-light enhancement models in learning improved features for LLE by integrating geometric priors into the feature representation space. In this paper, we employ depth priors as the geometric representation. Our approach focuses on the integration of depth priors into various LLE frameworks using a unified methodology. This methodology comprises two key novel modules. First, a depth-aware feature extraction module is designed to inject depth priors into the image representation. Then, Hierarchical Depth-Guided Feature Fusion Module (HDGFFM) is formulated with a cross-domain attention mechanism, which combines depth-aware features with the original image features within the LLE model. We conducted extensive experiments on public low-light image and video enhancement benchmarks. The results illustrate that our designed framework significantly enhances existing LLE methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn strong image priors from underlying data distribution and use them to solve inverse problems, but the training process is computationally expensive and requires lots of data. Such bottlenecks prevent most existing works from being feasible for high-dimensional and high-resolution data such as 3D images. This paper proposes a method to learn an efficient data prior for the entire image by training diffusion models only on patches of images. Specifically, we propose a patch-based position-aware diffusion inverse solver, called PaDIS, where we obtain the score function of the whole image through scores of patches and their positional encoding and utilize this as the prior for solving inverse problems. First of all, we show that this diffusion model achieves an improved memory efficiency and data efficiency while still maintaining the capability to generate entire images via positional encoding. Additionally, the proposed PaDIS model is highly flexible and can be plugged in with different diffusion inverse solvers (DIS). We demonstrate that the proposed PaDIS approach enables solving various inverse problems in both natural and medical image domains, including CT reconstruction, deblurring, and superresolution, given only patch-based priors. Notably, PaDIS outperforms previous DIS methods trained on entire image priors in the case of limited training data, demonstrating the data efficiency of our proposed approach by learning patch-based prior.

Abstract: Recent text-guided generation of individual 3D object has achieved great success using diffusion priors. However, these methods are not suitable for object insertion and replacement tasks as they do not consider the background, leading to illumination mismatches within the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce an illumination-aware 3D scene editing pipeline for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. Our key observation is that inpainting by the state-of-the-art conditional 2D diffusion model is consistent with background in lighting. To leverage the prior knowledge from the well-trained diffusion models for 3D object generation, our approach employs a coarse-to-fine objection optimization pipeline with inpainted views. In the first coarse step, we achieve image-to-3D lifting given an ideal inpainted view. The process employs 3D-aware diffusion prior from a view-conditioned diffusion model, which preserves illumination present in the conditioning image. To acquire an ideal inpainted image, we introduce an Anchor View Proposal (AVP) algorithm to find a single view that best represents the scene illumination in target region. In the second Texture Enhancement step, we introduce a novel Depth-guided Inpainting Score Distillation Sampling (DI-SDS), which enhances geometry and texture details with the inpainting diffusion prior, beyond the scope of the 3D-aware diffusion prior knowledge in the first coarse step. DI-SDS not only provides fine-grained texture enhancement, but also urges optimization to respect scene lighting. Our approach efficiently achieves local editing with global illumination consistency without explicitly modeling light transport. We demonstrate robustness of our method by evaluating editing in real scenes containing explicit highlight and shadows, and compare against the state-of-the-art text-to-3D editing methods.

Abstract: Facial expressions and actions differ among different individuals at varying degrees of intensity given responses to external stimuli, particularly among those that are neurodivergent. Such behaviors affect people in terms of overall health, communication, and sensory processing. Deep learning can be responsibly leveraged to improve productivity in addressing this task, and help medical professionals to accurately understand such behaviors. In this work, we introduce the Video ASD dataset-a dataset that contains video frame convolutional and attention map feature data-to foster further progress in the task of ASD classification. Unlike many recent studies in ASD classification with MRI data, which require expensive specialized equipment, our method utilizes a powerful but relatively affordable GPU, a standard computer setup, and a video camera for inference. Results show that our model effectively generalizes and understands key differences in the distinct movements of the children. Additionally, we test foundation models on this data to showcase how movement noise affects performance and the need for more data and more complex labels.

Abstract: Zero-shot action recognition, which addresses the issue of scalability and generalization in action recognition and allows the models to adapt to new and unseen actions dynamically, is an important research topic in computer vision communities. The key to zero-shot action recognition lies in aligning visual features with semantic vectors representing action categories. Most existing methods either directly project visual features onto the semantic space of text category or learn a shared embedding space between the two modalities. However, a direct projection cannot accurately align the two modalities, and learning robust and discriminative embedding space between visual and text representations is often difficult. To address these issues, we introduce Dual Visual-Text Alignment (DVTA) for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition. The DVTA consists of two alignment modules--Direct Alignment (DA) and Augmented Alignment (AA)--along with a designed Semantic Description Enhancement (SDE). The DA module maps the skeleton features to the semantic space through a specially designed visual projector, followed by the SDE, which is based on cross-attention to enhance the connection between skeleton and text, thereby reducing the gap between modalities. The AA module further strengthens the learning of the embedding space by utilizing deep metric learning to learn the similarity between skeleton and text. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances on several popular zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks. The code is available at: https://github.com/jidongkuang/DVTA.

Abstract: Reconciling agricultural production with climate-change mitigation is a formidable sustainability problem. Retaining trees in agricultural systems is one proposed solution, but the magnitude of the current and future-potential benefit that trees contribute to climate-change mitigation remains uncertain. Here, we help to resolve these issues across a West African region that produces ~60% of the world's cocoa, a crop contributing one of the highest carbon footprints of all foods. Using machine learning, we mapped shade-tree cover and carbon stocks across the region and found that existing average cover is low (~13%) and poorly aligned with climate threats. Yet, increasing shade-tree cover to a minimum of 30% could sequester an additional 307 million tonnes of CO2e, enough to offset ~167% of contemporary cocoa-related emissions in Ghana and C\^ote d'Ivoire--without reducing production. Our approach is transferable to other shade-grown crops and aligns with emerging carbon market and sustainability reporting frameworks.

Abstract: The Laplace-Beltrami operator has established itself in the field of non-rigid shape analysis due to its many useful properties such as being invariant under isometric transformation, having a countable eigensystem forming an orthornormal basis, and fully characterizing geodesic distances of the manifold. However, this invariancy only applies under isometric deformations, which leads to a performance breakdown in many real-world applications. In recent years emphasis has been placed upon extracting optimal features using deep learning methods,however spectral signatures play a crucial role and still add value. In this paper we take a step back, revisiting the LBO and proposing a supervised way to learn several operators on a manifold. Depending on the task, by applying these functions, we can train the LBO eigenbasis to be more task-specific. The optimization of the LBO leads to enormous improvements to established descriptors such as the heat kernel signature in various tasks such as retrieval, classification, segmentation, and correspondence, proving the adaption of the LBO eigenbasis to both global and highly local learning settings.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated outstanding performance in novel view synthesis, achieving a balance between rendering quality and real-time performance. 3DGS employs Adaptive Density Control (ADC) to increase the number of Gaussians. However, the clone and split operations within ADC are not sufficiently efficient, impacting optimization speed and detail recovery. Additionally, overfitted Gaussians that affect rendering quality may exist, and the original ADC is unable to remove them. To address these issues, we propose two key innovations: (1) Long-Axis Split, which precisely controls the position, shape, and opacity of child Gaussians to minimize the difference before and after splitting. (2) Recovery-Aware Pruning, which leverages differences in recovery speed after resetting opacity to prune overfitted Gaussians, thereby improving generalization performance. Experimental results show that our method significantly enhances rendering quality. Due to resubmission reasons, this version has been abandoned. The improved version is available at https://xiaobin2001.github.io/improved-gs-web .

Abstract: In real-world applications of image recognition tasks, such as human pose estimation, cameras often capture objects, like human bodies, at low resolutions. This scenario poses a challenge in extracting and leveraging multi-scale features, which is often essential for precise inference. To address this challenge, we propose a new attention mechanism, named cascaded multi-scale attention (CMSA), tailored for use in CNN-ViT hybrid architectures, to handle low-resolution inputs effectively. The design of CMSA enables the extraction and seamless integration of features across various scales without necessitating the downsampling of the input image or feature maps. This is achieved through a novel combination of grouped multi-head self-attention mechanisms with window-based local attention and cascaded fusion of multi-scale features over different scales. This architecture allows for the effective handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible.

Abstract: Recent diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in both 3D scene generation and perception tasks. Nevertheless, existing methods typically separate these two processes, acting as a data augmenter to generate synthetic data for downstream perception tasks. In this work, we propose OccScene, a novel mutual learning paradigm that integrates fine-grained 3D perception and high-quality generation in a unified framework, achieving a cross-task win-win effect. OccScene generates new and consistent 3D realistic scenes only depending on text prompts, guided with semantic occupancy in a joint-training diffusion framework. To align the occupancy with the diffusion latent, a Mamba-based Dual Alignment module is introduced to incorporate fine-grained semantics and geometry as perception priors. Within OccScene, the perception module can be effectively improved with customized and diverse generated scenes, while the perception priors in return enhance the generation performance for mutual benefits. Extensive experiments show that OccScene achieves realistic 3D scene generation in broad indoor and outdoor scenarios, while concurrently boosting the perception models to achieve substantial performance improvements in the 3D perception task of semantic occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces a critical challenge: balancing the retention of prior knowledge with the acquisition of new classes. Existing methods either freeze the backbone to prevent catastrophic forgetting, sacrificing plasticity, or add new modules, incurring high costs. These approaches treat pretrained models as black boxes, overlooking two key opportunities to exploit their internal capacity: reusing redundant representational space within layers and selectively adapting layers based on their sensitivity to forgetting. We propose CKPD-FSCIL, a unified framework that unlocks the underutilized capacity of pretrained weights, achieving a superior stability-plasticity balance with zero inference overhead. Our design integrates two continuously adapting mechanisms: At the weight level, a Continuous Knowledge-Preserving Decomposition mechanism uses feature covariance to split each weight matrix into a frozen subspace that safeguards prior knowledge and a learnable, redundant subspace for new tasks. At the layer level, a Continuous Adaptive Layer Selection mechanism leverages an Adapter Sensitivity Ratio to automatically select layers with the highest redundant capacity and lowest forgetting risk for adaptation. By targeting only safe, high-potential subspaces and layers, CKPD-FSCIL enables efficient adaptation. After each session, the learned adapters are merged back into the original weights, ensuring zero additional parameters or FLOPs during inference. Extensive experiments on multiple FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both adaptability and knowledge retention. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaojieli0903/CKPD-FSCIL.

Abstract: Demographic fairness in face recognition (FR) has emerged as a critical area of research, given its impact on fairness, equity, and reliability across diverse applications. As FR technologies are increasingly deployed globally, disparities in performance across demographic groups -- such as race, ethnicity, and gender -- have garnered significant attention. These biases not only compromise the credibility of FR systems but also raise ethical concerns, especially when these technologies are employed in sensitive domains. This review consolidates extensive research efforts providing a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted aspects of demographic fairness in FR.
  We systematically examine the primary causes, datasets, assessment metrics, and mitigation approaches associated with demographic disparities in FR. By categorizing key contributions in these areas, this work provides a structured approach to understanding and addressing the complexity of this issue. Finally, we highlight current advancements and identify emerging challenges that need further investigation. This article aims to provide researchers with a unified perspective on the state-of-the-art while emphasizing the critical need for equitable and trustworthy FR systems.

Abstract: The ability to automatically complete a partial sketch that depicts a complex scene, e.g., "a woman chatting with a man in the park", is very useful. However, existing sketch generation methods create sketches from scratch; they do not complete a partial sketch in the style of the original. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoSketch, a styleaware vector sketch completion method that accommodates diverse sketch styles. Our key observation is that the style descriptions of a sketch in natural language preserve the style during automatic sketch completion. Thus, we use a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) to describe the styles of the partial sketches in natural language and replicate these styles using newly generated strokes. We initially optimize the strokes to match an input prompt augmented by style descriptions extracted from the VLM. Such descriptions allow the method to establish a diffusion prior in close alignment with that of the partial sketch. Next, we utilize the VLM to generate an executable style adjustment code that adjusts the strokes to conform to the desired style. We compare our method with existing methods across various sketch styles and prompts, performed extensive ablation studies and qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and demonstrate that AutoSketch can support various sketch scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Latent Bridge Matching (LBM), a new, versatile and scalable method that relies on Bridge Matching in a latent space to achieve fast image-to-image translation. We show that the method can reach state-of-the-art results for various image-to-image tasks using only a single inference step. In addition to its efficiency, we also demonstrate the versatility of the method across different image translation tasks such as object removal, normal and depth estimation, and object relighting. We also derive a conditional framework of LBM and demonstrate its effectiveness by tackling the tasks of controllable image relighting and shadow generation. We provide an implementation at https://github.com/gojasper/LBM.

Abstract: Score distillation sampling is an effective technique to generate 3D models from text prompts, utilizing pre-trained large-scale text-to-image diffusion models as guidance. However, the produced 3D assets tend to be over-saturating, over-smoothing, with limited diversity. These issues are results from a reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence objective, which makes the optimization unstable and results in mode-seeking behavior. In this paper, we derive a bounded score distillation objective based on Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), which stabilizes the optimization process and produces high-quality 3D generation. JSD can match well generated and target distribution, therefore mitigating mode seeking. We provide a practical implementation of JSD by utilizing the theory of generative adversarial networks to define an approximate objective function for the generator, assuming the discriminator is well trained. By assuming the discriminator following a log-odds classifier, we propose a minority sampling algorithm to estimate the gradients of our proposed objective, providing a practical implementation for JSD. We conduct both theoretical and empirical studies to validate our method. Experimental results on T3Bench demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality and diversified 3D assets.

<title>Bring Your Rear Cameras for Egocentric 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>

Abstract: Egocentric 3D human pose estimation has been actively studied using cameras installed in front of a head-mounted device (HMD). While frontal placement is the optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it remains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion and limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods often fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD users tilt their heads upward -- a common motion in human activities. A key limitation of existing HMD designs is their neglect of the back of the body, despite its potential to provide crucial 3D reconstruction cues. Hence, this paper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras for full-body tracking. We also show that simply adding rear views to the frontal inputs is not optimal for existing methods due to their dependence on individual 2D joint detectors without effective multi-view integration. To address this issue, we propose a new transformer-based method that refines 2D joint heatmap estimation with multi-view information and heatmap uncertainty, thereby improving 3D pose tracking. Also, we introduce two new large-scale datasets, Ego4View-Syn and Ego4View-RW, for a rear-view evaluation. Our experiments show that the new camera configurations with back views provide superior support for 3D pose tracking compared to only frontal placements. The proposed method achieves significant improvement over the current state of the art (>10% on MPJPE). The source code, trained models, and datasets are available on our project page at https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/EgoRear/.

Abstract: A high-performance image compression algorithm is crucial for real-time information transmission across numerous fields. Despite rapid progress in image compression, computational inefficiency and poor redundancy modeling still pose significant bottlenecks, limiting practical applications. Inspired by the effectiveness of state space models (SSMs) in capturing long-range dependencies, we leverage SSMs to address computational inefficiency in existing methods and improve image compression from multiple perspectives. In this paper, we integrate the advantages of SSMs for better efficiency-performance trade-off and propose an enhanced image compression approach through refined context modeling, which we term MambaIC. Specifically, we explore context modeling to adaptively refine the representation of hidden states. Additionally, we introduce window-based local attention into channel-spatial entropy modeling to reduce potential spatial redundancy during compression, thereby increasing efficiency. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, particularly for high-resolution image compression. Code is released at https://github.com/AuroraZengfh/MambaIC.

<title>Adaptive Multi-Order Graph Regularized NMF with Dual Sparsity for Hyperspectral Unmixing</title>

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) is a critical yet challenging task in remote sensing. However, existing nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) methods with graph learning mostly focus on first-order or second-order nearest neighbor relationships and usually require manual parameter tuning, which fails to characterize intrinsic data structures. To address the above issues, we propose a novel adaptive multi-order graph regularized NMF method (MOGNMF) with three key features. First, multi-order graph regularization is introduced into the NMF framework to exploit global and local information comprehensively. Second, these parameters associated with the multi-order graph are learned adaptively through a data-driven approach. Third, dual sparsity is embedded to obtain better robustness, i.e., $\ell_{1/2}$-norm on the abundance matrix and $\ell_{2,1}$-norm on the noise matrix. To solve the proposed model, we develop an alternating minimization algorithm whose subproblems have explicit solutions, thus ensuring effectiveness. Experiments on simulated and real hyperspectral data indicate that the proposed method delivers better unmixing results.

<title>EHGCN: Hierarchical Euclidean-Hyperbolic Fusion via Motion-Aware GCN for Hybrid Event Stream Perception</title>

Abstract: Event cameras, with microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) characteristics, emit high-speed event stream for perception tasks. Despite the recent advancement in GNN-based perception methods, they are prone to use straightforward pairwise connectivity mechanisms in the pure Euclidean space where they struggle to capture long-range dependencies and fail to effectively characterize the inherent hierarchical structures of non-uniformly distributed event stream. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel approach named EHGCN, which is a pioneer to perceive event stream in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces for event vision. In EHGCN, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically regulate sampling rates, retaining discriminative events while attenuating chaotic noise. Then we present a Markov Vector Field (MVF)-driven motion-aware hyperedge generation method based on motion state transition probabilities, thereby eliminating cross-target spurious associations and providing critically topological priors while capturing long-range dependencies between events. Finally, we propose a Euclidean-Hyperbolic GCN to fuse the information locally aggregated and globally hierarchically modeled in Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, respectively, to achieve hybrid event perception. Experimental results on event perception tasks such as object detection and recognition validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Accurate 3D trajectory data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving. Yet, traditional datasets are usually captured by fixed sensors mounted on a car and are susceptible to occlusion. Additionally, such an approach can precisely reconstruct the dynamic environment in the close vicinity of the measurement vehicle only, while neglecting objects that are further away. In this paper, we introduce the DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D), a high-quality, occlusion-free dataset of 6 degrees of freedom bounding box trajectories acquired through a novel monocular camera drone tracking pipeline. Our dataset includes more than 175,000 trajectories of 14 types of traffic participants and significantly exceeds existing datasets in terms of diversity and scale, containing many unprecedented scenarios such as complex vehicle-pedestrian interaction on highly populated urban streets and comprehensive parking maneuvers from entry to exit. DSC3D dataset was captured in five various locations in Europe and the United States and include: a parking lot, a crowded inner-city, a steep urban intersection, a federal highway, and a suburban intersection. Our 3D trajectory dataset aims to enhance autonomous driving systems by providing detailed environmental 3D representations, which could lead to improved obstacle interactions and safety. We demonstrate its utility across multiple applications including motion prediction, motion planning, scenario mining, and generative reactive traffic agents. Our interactive online visualization platform and the complete dataset are publicly available at https://app.deepscenario.com, facilitating research in motion prediction, behavior modeling, and safety validation.

<title>CAMA: Enhancing Multimodal In-Context Learning with Context-Aware Modulated Attention</title>

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a key capability that enables large vision-language models (LVLMs) to adapt to novel tasks without parameter updates, expanding their utility across various real-world applications. However, ICL remains unstable, even with well-matched in-context demonstrations (ICDs), suggesting that LVLMs struggle to fully utilize the provided context. While existing efforts focus on prompt engineering or post-hoc logit calibration, we instead investigate the underlying attention dynamics to overcome LVLMs' inherent limitations. We identify two critical deficits in their self-attention that impair effective ICL. To bridge the gap, we propose \textbf{Context-Aware Modulated Attention} (CAMA), a plug-and-play and training-free method that dynamically modulates LVLM's attention logits based on the input in-context sequence. CAMA employs a two-stage attention modulation to address both identified deficits, enhancing the focus on semantically significant tokens, particularly visual ones. Across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks, CAMA consistently outperforms vanilla models and baselines, demonstrating great effectiveness and generalization. It can also activate the desired effects of prompt engineering methods and remains robust under diverse sequence configurations. Thus, CAMA paves the way for deeper explorations of attention dynamics to advance multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24, SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement (RPM) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for monitoring physiological signals using the non-contact device. Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based RPM models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects such as privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for RPM tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of BVP signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human perception, yet existing human-centric metrics are constrained by limited data coverage, suboptimal feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions. To address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1) We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating 1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images. (2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of \textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression \textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80 million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller}, the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further research building upon our contributions.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D scene representation, offering high-fidelity photorealistic rendering with real-time performance. Beyond novel view synthesis, the explicit and compact nature of 3DGS enables a wide range of downstream applications that require geometric and semantic understanding. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in 3DGS applications. It first introduces 2D foundation models that support semantic understanding and control in 3DGS applications, followed by a review of NeRF-based methods that inform their 3DGS counterparts. We then categorize 3DGS applications into segmentation, editing, generation, and other functional tasks. For each, we summarize representative methods, supervision strategies, and learning paradigms, highlighting shared design principles and emerging trends. Commonly used datasets and evaluation protocols are also summarized, along with comparative analyses of recent methods across public benchmarks. To support ongoing research and development, a continually updated repository of papers, code, and resources is maintained at https://github.com/heshuting555/Awesome-3DGS-Applications.

<title>A Curious Case of Remarkable Resilience to Gradient Attacks via Fully Convolutional and Differentiable Front End with a Skip Connection</title>

arXiv:2402.17018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimented with front-end enhanced neural models where a differentiable and fully convolutional model with a skip connection is added before a frozen backbone classifier. By training such composite models using a small learning rate for about one epoch, we obtained models that retained the accuracy of the backbone classifier while being unusually resistant to gradient attacks-including APGD and FAB-T attacks from the AutoAttack package-which we attribute to gradient masking. Although gradient masking is not new, the degree we observe is striking for fully differentiable models without obvious gradient-shattering-e.g., JPEG compression-or gradient-diminishing components.
  The training recipe to produce such models is also remarkably stable and reproducible: We applied it to three datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet) and several modern architectures (including vision Transformers) without a single failure case. While black-box attacks such as the SQUARE attack and zero-order PGD can partially overcome gradient masking, these attacks are easily defeated by simple randomized ensembles. We estimate that these ensembles achieve near-SOTA AutoAttack accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet (while retaining almost all clean accuracy of the original classifiers) despite having near-zero accuracy under adaptive attacks.
  Adversarially training the backbone further amplifies this front-end "robustness". On CIFAR10, the respective randomized ensemble achieved 90.8$\pm 2.5\%$ (99\% CI) accuracy under the full AutoAttack while having only 18.2$\pm 3.6\%$ accuracy under the adaptive attack ($\varepsilon=8/255$, $L^\infty$ norm). We conclude the paper with a discussion of whether randomized ensembling can serve as a practical defense.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading paradigm in generative modeling, excelling in various applications. Despite their success, these models often misalign with human intentions and generate results with undesired properties or even harmful content. Inspired by the success and popularity of alignment in tuning large language models, recent studies have investigated aligning diffusion models with human expectations and preferences. This work mainly reviews alignment of text-to-image diffusion models, covering advancements in fundamentals of alignment, alignment techniques of diffusion models, preference benchmarks, and evaluation for diffusion models. Moreover, we discuss key perspectives on current challenges and promising future directions on solving the remaining challenges in alignment of diffusion models. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive review paper for researchers and engineers to comprehend, practice, and research alignment of diffusion models.

Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %) while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time) significantly.

Abstract: With ever-increasing data volumes, it is essential to develop automated approaches for identifying nanoscale defects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. However, compared to features in conventional photographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due to the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These challenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of annotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning model performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we examined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for natural images.
  We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization, semantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable cues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement cannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which can be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we introduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation accuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we found that our approach led to a 57% increase in defect detection rate, which is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset used in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers.

<title>ScrewSplat: An End-to-End Method for Articulated Object Recognition</title>

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However, existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot, text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Abstract: Counterfactual generation offers a principled framework for simulating hypothetical changes in medical imaging, with potential applications in understanding disease mechanisms and generating physiologically plausible data. However, generating realistic structural 3D brain MRIs that respect anatomical and causal constraints remains challenging due to data scarcity, structural complexity, and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. In this work, we convert six generative models into 3D counterfactual approaches by incorporating an anatomy-guided framework based on a causal graph, in which regional brain volumes serve as direct conditioning inputs. Each model is evaluated with respect to composition, reversibility, realism, effectiveness and minimality on T1-weighted brain MRIs (T1w MRIs) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In addition, we test the generalizability of each model with respect to T1w MRIs of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Our results indicate that anatomically grounded conditioning successfully modifies the targeted anatomical regions; however, it exhibits limitations in preserving non-targeted structures. Beyond laying the groundwork for more interpretable and clinically relevant generative modeling of brain MRIs, this benchmark highlights the need for novel architectures that more accurately capture anatomical interdependencies.

Abstract: Accurate preoperative prediction of erectile dysfunction (ED) is important for counseling patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. While clinical features are established predictors, the added value of preoperative MRI remains underexplored. We investigate whether MRI provides additional predictive value for ED at 12 months post-surgery, evaluating four modeling strategies: (1) a clinical-only baseline, representing current state-of-the-art; (2) classical models using handcrafted anatomical features derived from MRI; (3) deep learning models trained directly on MRI slices; and (4) multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical inputs. Imaging-based models (maximum AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical approaches (AUC 0.554) but fell short of the clinical baseline (AUC 0.663). Fusion models offered marginal gains (AUC 0.586) but did not exceed clinical-only performance. SHAP analysis confirmed that clinical features contributed most to predictive performance. Saliency maps from the best-performing imaging model suggested a predominant focus on anatomically plausible regions, such as the prostate and neurovascular bundles. While MRI-based models did not improve predictive performance over clinical features, our findings suggest that they try to capture patterns in relevant anatomical structures and may complement clinical predictors in future multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential to human health, and their precise morphological analysis is important for diagnosing hematological disorders. Despite the promise of foundation models in medical diagnostics, comprehensive AI solutions for RBC analysis remain scarce. We present RedDino, a self-supervised foundation model designed for RBC image analysis. RedDino uses an RBC-specific adaptation of the DINOv2 self-supervised learning framework and is trained on a curated dataset of 1.25 million RBC images from diverse acquisition modalities and sources. Extensive evaluations show that RedDino outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on RBC shape classification. Through assessments including linear probing and nearest neighbor classification, we confirm its strong feature representations and generalization ability. Our main contributions are: (1) a foundation model tailored for RBC analysis, (2) ablation studies exploring DINOv2 configurations for RBC modeling, and (3) a detailed evaluation of generalization performance. RedDino addresses key challenges in computational hematology by capturing nuanced morphological features, advancing the development of reliable diagnostic tools. The source code and pretrained models for RedDino are available at https://github.com/Snarci/RedDino, and the pretrained models can be downloaded from our Hugging Face collection at https://huggingface.co/collections/Snarcy/reddino-689a13e29241d2e5690202fc

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax, to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces YOPO, a single-stage, query-based framework for accurately recovering the 9-DoF pose of unseen instances from RGB images. YOPO unifies object detection and pose estimation at the category level without additional data, surpassing RGB-only methods and closing the gap to RGB-D systems. It consists of a transformer detector augmented with a lightweight pose head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost. Trained end-to-end with only RGB images and category-level pose labels, YOPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks, including an IoU of 79.6% on the REAL275 dataset and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric. The approach addresses the core challenge of accurate pose estimation for robotics and automation, providing a simpler and more efficient solution.

arXiv:2508.14965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of 2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6% $\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code, models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

<div> Framework, Face Recognition, Spoofing Attacks, Training Approach, Liveness cues<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces the Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework, a unified training approach for face recognition systems to detect both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries. This framework utilizes matched pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn liveness cues that are independent of the attack modality. By integrating both types of attacks into a single model, the framework reduces system complexity, inference latency, and vulnerability to combined attack vectors. The method outperforms existing solutions in the detection of spoofing attempts, achieving an average classification error rate of 2.10 percent on the Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge benchmark. Additionally, the framework is lightweight with low computational requirements (4.46 GFLOPs) and can be trained in under an hour, making it suitable for practical deployment in real-world scenarios. The code and pretrained models are publicly available for further research and experimentation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts, including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries. Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models, each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues. Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. It utilizes diffusion models to produce high-quality adversarial examples in just 3-20 sampling steps. By injecting perturbations during the mixing step interval, the method achieves comparable attack effectiveness without processing all timesteps. A selective RGB channel strategy is implemented to preserve image structure while maximizing misclassification in target models. Visual quality is maintained with a PSNR above 30 dB across various datasets. On ImageNet, TAIGen achieves high success rates against different source models, generating adversarial examples 10x faster than existing diffusion-based attacks. It also exhibits the lowest robust accuracy, indicating its significant impact as defense mechanisms are less successful in purifying TAIGen-generated images.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source, TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8% against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

<div> Keywords: Concealed visual perception, reversible unfolding network, generative refinement, diffusion model, bi-level optimization.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel method called RUN++ for concealed visual perception (CVP) that leverages a reversible unfolding network with generative refinement. The approach encompasses both the mask and RGB domains, addressing uncertainty in a principled manner. The network consists of three modules: CORE for object region extraction, CARE for context-aware region enhancement, and FINE for finetuning via noise-based enhancement. FINE utilizes a targeted Bernoulli diffusion model to refine uncertain regions, improving segmentation accuracy without high computational costs. This integration of reversible modeling and diffusion allows RUN++ to focus on ambiguous areas, reducing false positives and negatives. Additionally, the article proposes a bi-level optimization framework for robust CVP systems that are resilient to real-world degradations. The innovative approach of RUN++ showcases its efficacy in addressing uncertainty in CVP tasks with a focus on accuracy and efficiency.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction (CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation; and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask, harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives. Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a broader bi-level optimization framework.

<div> Keywords: rectified flow models, non-linear trajectories, semantic alignment, image generation, curvature guidance<br />
Summary: <br />
CurveFlow introduces a new flow matching framework that incorporates curvature guidance to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories in text-to-image generation. The method includes a robust curvature regularization technique to penalize abrupt changes in trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on MS COCO datasets show that CurveFlow outperforms standard rectified flow models and other non-linear baselines, such as Rectified Diffusion, in semantic consistency metrics like BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. The results indicate that the curvature-aware modeling enhances the model's ability to follow complex instructions accurately while maintaining high image quality. The code for CurveFlow is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow. <div>
arXiv:2508.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017 demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality.

<div> Keywords: no-reference image quality assessment, self-supervised framework, hierarchical ranking, contrastive learning, generalization performance

Summary:
HiRQA is a self-supervised framework for image quality assessment that combines hierarchical ranking and contrastive learning to predict quality scores using only the input image, without reliance on pristine references or subjective labels. It introduces a higher-order ranking loss to supervise quality predictions through relational ordering, an embedding distance loss to enforce consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences, and a training-time contrastive alignment loss guided by structured textual prompts. Despite being trained on synthetic distortions, HiRQA demonstrates effective generalization to authentic degradations such as lens flare, haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. A lightweight variant, HiRQA-S, offers real-time deployment with an inference time of only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments confirm HiRQA's state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization ability, and scalability.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts, further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare, haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong generalization ability, and scalability.

Summary:
The paper presents a novel edge resource management strategy inspired by portfolio theory for reliable multi-view 3D reconstruction in dynamic environments. The study focuses on the challenges of maintaining reconstruction quality in edge environments with spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. By using a genetic algorithm to solve the optimization problem, the proposed strategy ensures reconstruction quality satisfaction even under adverse conditions. The research demonstrates the benefits of the camera selection strategy in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction compared to traditional baseline methods.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response, tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However, reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM (eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports. These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations, showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces MeSS, a method for generating realistic outdoor scenes using city mesh models as a geometric prior. The approach enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency, resulting in high-quality, style-consistent scenes. The pipeline includes three stages: generating sparse views, propagating denser intermediate views, and eliminating visual inconsistencies. A 3D Gaussian Splatting scene is reconstructed concurrently with generation. The method outperforms existing approaches in geometric alignment and generation quality. The synthesized scenes can be rendered in various styles through relighting and style transfer techniques. <div>
arXiv:2508.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however, the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS (Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure) using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces SurgWound, an open-source dataset containing 697 annotated surgical wound images. A benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis is also presented, comprising visual question answering and report generation tasks. The WoundQwen framework is proposed for surgical wound diagnosis, utilizing a three-stage learning approach. The framework involves the use of multiple language models for accurate prediction of wound characteristics, assessment of infection risk, and personalized patient instructions based on image analysis. This innovative approach aims to improve surgical wound care by providing detailed diagnostics and guiding timely interventions, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation. Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Summary:
In the realm of reinforcement learning, where agents are trained to exhibit optimal behavior in specific environments, the accurate modeling of rule-based surrounding agents is crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. Current methods rely on behavior modeling strategies and IDM models to capture the actions of surrounding agents. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes a learning-based method to derive adversarial behavior for rule-based agents, thereby inducing failure scenarios for evaluation. By pitting the adversarial agent against traditional rule-based agents, a discernible decrease in cumulative reward is observed. This work highlights the significance of considering adversarial behavior within the training framework for reinforcing the robustness of autonomous systems in challenging environments.

We present a learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Summary: <br />
The study presents DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic segmentation pipeline for accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units. Traditional post-processing techniques struggle with the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity in renal tissue. DyMorph-B2I integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations with adaptive refinement and hyperparameter tuning for each functional unit. Through parameter optimization, it effectively separates adherent and heterogeneous structures in binary masks, outperforming individual methods and na\"ive combinations. This enhances instance separation and enables more precise morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline is publicly accessible at https://github.com/ddrrnn123/DyMorph-B2I. <div>
arXiv:2508.15208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline is publicly available at: https://github.com/ddrrnn123/DyMorph-B2I.

Summary:
Accident prediction is crucial for enhancing road safety and minimizing injuries and property damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) play a vital role in anticipating accidents before they occur. This study focuses on using dash-cam videos as a cost-effective solution for accident prediction.

Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the STAGNet model outperforms existing methods in terms of average precision and mean time-to-collision values. The model shows superior performance both in cross-validation within a dataset and in training and testing on different datasets. The findings highlight the potential of utilizing dash-cam videos and advanced neural networks for effective accident prediction in road safety applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.

Summary:  
TriMM is a new 3D-native generative model that leverages multi-modal data (RGB, RGBD, point cloud) for enhanced 3D asset modeling. It introduces collaborative multi-modal coding to combine modality-specific features while maintaining their unique strengths. Auxilary 2D and 3D supervision improve robustness and performance. The model employs a triplane latent diffusion model for high-quality 3D asset generation, enhancing both texture and geometric detail. TriMM achieves competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets using minimal training data. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate its effectiveness, and the model can also incorporate other multi-modal datasets for 3D generation.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds). Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework to address the conflict problem in contrastive learning for clustering tasks. The framework comprises a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning module. The soft prototype contrastive module calculates prototypes based on the probability of sample belonging to the cluster center, reducing inter-class conflicts and prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns transformations of samples and their neighborhoods, ensuring transformation-invariant semantic information and compact intra-cluster distribution. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art. Code for the approach is available on GitHub for further exploration and integration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Summary:
Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task aims at enabling UAVs to navigate outdoor environments using natural language instructions and visual cues. Due to the complexity of UAV trajectories, achieving reliable performance is challenging. To address this, a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN) is introduced, where two UAVs operate at different altitudes for broad environmental reasoning and precise navigation. The HaL-13k dataset containing collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories is created to support training and evaluation. A dual-UAV collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, is proposed with one UAV integrating a language model for target reasoning and the other using a policy for navigation. The UAVs work collaboratively with minimal coordination exchange. This approach leverages the mobility of UAVs to provide multi-grained perspectives while maintaining manageable learning spaces, enhancing performance in VLN tasks.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning, and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising 13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets. To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, skipped-step sampling, generation tasks, DDIM, accelerated sampling

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new approach called skipped-step sampling to accelerate the generation process in diffusion models. The traditional step-by-step generation process in diffusion models can be time-consuming, and existing methods like DDIM have attempted to reduce the number of sampling steps. The authors argue that the original diffusion process can achieve efficiency without non-Markovian processes. By introducing skipped-step sampling, multiple intermediate denoising steps can be bypassed, resulting in accelerated sampling in a Markovian way. The research shows that this mechanism is derived from the same training objective as the standard diffusion model, suggesting that it is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. The proposed method, which integrates skipped-step sampling with DDIM, achieves high-quality generation with significantly fewer sampling steps. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models validate the effectiveness of the approach. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods, such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective. However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially, we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models, including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling steps.

Summary: <br />
Comp-X is a new image compression paradigm that utilizes a large language model agent to intelligently interact with users. The paradigm addresses limitations of traditional image codecs by incorporating a multi-functional coding framework that can adapt to different coding modes based on user requirements. An interactive coding agent is employed to teach the language model agent how to understand coding requests and select appropriate modes. A dedicated benchmark, IIC-bench, is introduced for evaluation. Experimental results show that Comp-X can efficiently understand coding requests and maintain impressive compression performance. This approach opens up possibilities for artificial general intelligence in image compression. <div>
arXiv:2508.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i) multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request, mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile, it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence (AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.

Summary: 
The paper introduces RATopo, a strategy for improved lane topology reasoning in autonomous driving systems. Unlike existing methods that rely on limited one-to-one assignments for topology supervision, RATopo enables quantity-rich and diverse geometry topology supervision. By rearranging the Transformer decoder and incorporating multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with independent parameters, RATopo allows for redundant lane predictions and effective one-to-many assignments. This approach enhances the diversity of detected lanes and improves both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance. Experimental results on OpenLane-V2 show that RATopo is model-agnostic and can seamlessly integrate into existing topology reasoning frameworks, offering consistent enhancements in autonomous driving systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision. Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data. However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval, which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PATENTCLIP-4661/README.md.

<div> Keywords: Congenital heart defect, Ultrasound videos, Machine learning, Temporal modeling, Uncertainty quantification

Summary:
Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is introduced as a method for fetal congenital heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos. It addresses the challenges of image noise and probe positioning variability by leveraging temporal information and prompt-aware contrastive learning. TPA extracts features from video frames, captures heart motion with a temporal extractor, and aligns representations with class-specific text prompts using a contrastive loss. A Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module enhances calibration for clinical reliability by quantifying uncertainty in the classification. The performance of TPA was validated on both a private dataset for CHD detection and a public dataset for systolic dysfunction, achieving state-of-the-art macro F1 scores for CHD diagnosis and reducing expected calibration error and adaptive ECE. Overall, TPA offers a comprehensive framework for accurate and reliable classification of fetal CHD in ultrasound videos. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to 58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Summary: 
The paper introduces BasketLiDAR, a multimodal dataset for real-time 3D player tracking in basketball. Traditional systems struggle with the complexities of the sport, but using LiDAR point clouds and multi-view camera footage, the authors achieve improved accuracy and reduced computational cost. The dataset includes 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, synchronized across three LiDAR sensors and multi-view cameras. The proposed approach leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information, enabling real-time operation and superior tracking performance, particularly in occlusion scenarios.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience. Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball, in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field, as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking performance even under occlusion conditions.

<div> Retrieval-Augmented Generation, SAM-based segmentation, training-free paradigm, Camouflaged object detection, benchmark datasets <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel approach called RAG-SEG for camouflaged object detection, addressing the challenges of similarity between objects and backgrounds. It decouples the task into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for prompt generation and SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement without the need for extensive training. RAG-SEG utilizes unsupervised clustering to create a compact retrieval database for efficient feature retrieval. During inference, retrieved features guide mask generation using SAM2, achieving competitive performance without traditional training requirements. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate RAG-SEG's effectiveness, with results comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods. The method's computational efficiency allows for practical implementation even on personal laptops. Further analysis in the Appendix discusses limitations, potential extensions for salient object detection, and suggestions for improvement. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds. Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance. However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and possible improvements.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces VideoEraser, a training-free framework aimed at preventing text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models from generating harmful or misleading content. The framework consists of two stages: Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG).

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process: Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that. It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road crossing intents.

Summary:<br /><br />
1. The study uses attention knockouts to analyze Video Large Language Models, revealing that video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers, with lower layers focusing on perceptual encoding and higher layers on abstract reasoning.
2. In a fine-grained setting, certain intermediate layers play a crucial role in video question answering, while most other layers contribute minimally.
3. Spatial-temporal modeling in Video-LLMs relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame self-attention among video tokens.
4. Insights from the study can be used to reduce attention computation in Video-LLMs, enhancing efficiency.
5. This research is the first to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs process and understand video content, offering insights into interpretability and efficiency for future studies. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance, with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers, forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding, while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting, certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future research.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration. Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters, which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task. Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across diverse data characteristics and distributions.

<div> Keywords: 3D Gaussian Splatting, compression, archival, adaptability, scene changes

Summary: 
The study introduces Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) to improve compression efficiency and adaptability in 3D scene rendering. It addresses limitations of current compression methods by efficiently quantizing scenes to the kilobyte range and accommodating post-archival scene changes. This is achieved by leveraging inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and using shared codebooks across scenes. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, enabling effective conditional decoding based on captured images. ICGS-Quantizer outperforms existing methods in both compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes. The approach offers a practical solution for compressing and managing large-scale scenes or extensive scene collections while preserving visual fidelity. The code, model, and data are made publicly available on GitHub for further research and development. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks. This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating. Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Summary: 
The article introduces DriveSplat, a novel method for high-quality reconstruction of driving scenarios using neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. By partitioning the scene into near, middle, and far regions, the method enhances close-range detail representation, particularly suited for linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints. Deformable neural Gaussians model non-rigid dynamic actors, with parameters adjusted by a learnable deformation network. The framework is supervised by depth and normal priors from pre-trained models to improve geometric accuracy. DriveSplat has been evaluated on Waymo and KITTI datasets, showing superior performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios. <div>

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles, pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near, middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation. Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors, whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network. The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Summary: Despite the effective performance of current deep learning models, abstract reasoning remains a challenge. This paper focuses on solving Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems to enhance machine intelligence in this area. It analyzes the complete causal chain in RPM tasks and designs a network architecture based on this analysis. However, the baseline model DIO falls short in acquiring human reasoning logic due to limitations in the optimization objective. Three improvement methods are then proposed to overcome these limitations. The tightness of the lower bound affects mutual information maximization, which does not capture the causal relationship between subjects and objects. These improvements aim to address these limitations and improve the abstract reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. <div>

To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms, with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a ``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes $\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency $\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option, fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However, existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Summary: 
This study explores the relationship between hyperparameters and performance in Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) for vision models. The focus is on how MAEs learn spatial correlations in input images. Analytical derivation of linear MAE features reveals that masking ratio and patch size influence the capture of short- and long-range spatial correlations. Non-linear MAEs adapt to dataset spatial correlations beyond second-order statistics. The findings suggest that hyperparameters can be selected to affect the types of spatial features learned by MAEs, offering insights for practical implementation. <div>

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE hyper-parameters in practice.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel method, BIRD, for moving infrared small target detection. Traditional methods use sliding window approaches, which do not optimize the entire video clip and overlook global temporal information, leading to suboptimal results. BIRD utilizes bidirectional temporal information propagation, combining local and global temporal information in a recursive manner. The proposed method consists of Local Temporal Motion Fusion and Global Temporal Motion Fusion modules to model spatio-temporal dependencies and aggregate propagation features. Additionally, the video clip is jointly optimized with a Spatio-Temporal Fusion loss. Experimental results demonstrate that BIRD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fast inference speed, surpassing existing approaches in moving infrared small target detection. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion. Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference speed.

Summary:
Machine learning-based techniques using the YOLOv8 object recognition framework provide a solution for automatically detecting tiny surface flaws, like microscopic dents, on car exteriors. Traditional manual car damage inspection methods are time-consuming and often unreliable in detecting small imperfections. A custom dataset with annotated car surface photos was created for training the YOLOv8m model and its variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and YOLOv8m-t42, with real-time data augmentation techniques. Experimental results showed high detection accuracy and low inference latency, making the model suitable for real-time applications such as automated insurance evaluations. YOLOv8m-t42 outperformed YOLOv8m-t4 in identifying microscopic surface defects, with higher precision, recall, and F1-score. Although YOLOv8m-t42 exhibits slower convergence, it offers greater accuracy and consistency for practical dent detection applications. The model's performance was validated using evaluation parameters such as mAP, precision, recall, and F1-score. <br /><br /> Summary: <div>

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual, and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents. Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual, time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches. Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of 0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4 model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82). YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Summary: 
MATR is a transformer-based model for Video-to-video moment retrieval, focusing on semantic alignment and complex dependencies between query and target videos. It utilizes dual-stage sequence alignment to encode correlations and dependencies, enabling precise moment localization. The model employs foreground/background classification and boundary prediction heads to accurately identify moments in the target video. Additionally, a self-supervised pre-training technique helps provide task-specific initialization for MATR, improving performance significantly on ActivityNet-VRL and SportsMoments datasets. Experimental results show notable increases in Recall@1 and mIoU compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating MATR's effectiveness in accurately localizing unseen events or moments in target videos using a query video. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset, SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an absolute scale over strong baselines.

Summary:
A new method is proposed for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that tackles the challenge of reconstructing 3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs without relying on Structure-from-Motion (SfM). The approach combines a dense stereo module for pose estimation and point cloud reconstruction, along with a view interpolation module that generates consistent content for improved supervision during training. Additional regularization techniques are introduced to enhance geometrical structures and rendered content quality. Experimental results show a significant performance improvement over existing methods, with a 2.75dB increase in PSNR under extremely sparse-view conditions using only 2 training views. The synthesized images demonstrate minimal distortion and rich high-frequency details, showcasing superior visual quality compared to current techniques. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse, the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes, resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs 3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches, achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details, resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

<div> Keyword: Medical image segmentation, Lightweight model, Attention mechanism, Channel redundancy, LGMSNet <br />
Summary: <br />
Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning in resource-constrained clinical settings. Existing lightweight models often sacrifice performance for efficiency, lacking global contextual perception capabilities due to the absence of attention mechanisms. The channel redundancy issue under the same convolutional kernels in medical imaging also poses a challenge for effective feature extraction. To address these issues, LGMSNet, a novel lightweight framework, combines local and global dual multiscale approaches to achieve high performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet utilizes heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency information and mitigate channel redundancy, while incorporating sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing methods, particularly excelling in zero-shot generalization tests on unseen datasets, showcasing its potential for deployment in resource-limited medical settings. <div>

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However, existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally, current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning. AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high- and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes, enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components, AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features, reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF) -- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG) representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF) design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups, and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving high fidelity along the original trajectory.

Built upon the encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9) that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths, D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding. These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

<div> Keywords: Test-time adaptation, zero-shot robustness, Gaussian probabilistic inference, class-conditional likelihoods, scalability

Summary:
ADAPT is a novel method for test-time adaptation that improves zero-shot robustness by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This approach reframes the task as Gaussian probabilistic inference, enabling closed-form, training-free inference without the need for backpropagation or iterative optimization. To address potential bias, ADAPT introduces regularization guided by CLIP priors and historical knowledge. Importantly, this method requires no source data, gradient updates, or full access to target data, supporting online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate ADAPT's state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, showcasing superior scalability and robustness under various distribution shifts. <div>

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

<div> Keywords: Implicit Neural Representations, spectral bias, high-frequency details, two-stage training, neighbor-aware soft mask

Summary:<br />
Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) represent images as continuous functions over spatial coordinates, offering an alternative to pixel-based formats. However, neural networks tend to favor low-frequency components, leading to difficulty in capturing high-frequency details such as sharp edges and textures. To address this, a two-stage training strategy is proposed, where a neighbor-aware soft mask assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations in the first stage, focusing on fine details before transitioning to full-image training. Experimental results demonstrate improved reconstruction quality and complement existing INR methods. This approach introduces frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR, providing a promising solution to mitigate the spectral bias problem.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations, encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR, our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

<div> Keywords: point cloud registration, outlier rates, truncated least squares, convex relaxation, Branch and Bound <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a new approach for robust point cloud registration, particularly focusing on dealing with high outlier rates. By utilizing a truncated least squares formulation, the proposed method can handle up to 95% outliers. The key innovation lies in a novel linear time convex relaxation and a contractor method to accelerate the Branch and Bound algorithm. This approach achieves provably global optimal results in a significantly reduced time frame compared to existing methods. While currently limited to solving rotation-only TLS problems, the solver showcases impressive speed improvements, outperforming state-of-the-art SDP solvers. Formal proofs for global optimality are provided, along with empirical evidence demonstrating efficacy even in cases with local minima near the global minimum.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems. Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning. Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions. Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of 96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape management.

<title>When and What: Diffusion-Grounded VideoLLM with Entity Aware Segmentation for Long Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity, and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks.

<title>Weakly-Supervised Learning for Tree Instances Segmentation in Airborne Lidar Point Clouds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is reduced.

<title>Towards a 3D Transfer-based Black-box Attack via Critical Feature Guidance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15650</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

<title>MapKD: Unlocking Prior Knowledge with Cross-Modal Distillation for Efficient Online HD Map Construction</title>

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS) paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally, we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously accelerating inference speed.

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins, and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2 building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution, CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis. Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling.

arXiv:2508.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs' pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks, including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios. Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware compression approaches.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge. Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model (SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods: prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V), image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single, integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably, it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. We hope this technical report will help the community more efficiently train high-quality video generation models and accelerate progress in video generation technologies.

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity, fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation, potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code and model will be publicly available at: https://mengmouxu.github.io/SceneGen.

<title>Visual Autoregressive Modeling for Instruction-Guided Image Editing</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer. VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a $512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at https://github.com/HiDream-ai/VAREdit.

<title>Scaling Group Inference for Diverse and High-Quality Generation</title>

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity (binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning, and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated video samples are available at our website: https://eyeline-labs.github.io/CineScale/.

Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data, minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum, with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline <-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers. Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299 patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG. Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive, highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease progression.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras, these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the \textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes and applications in-the-loop. The MIT-licensed software is available from a centralized repository at \href{https://github.com/ac-freeman/adder-codec-rs}{https://github.com/ac-freeman/adder-codec-rs}.

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC protocol draft.

Abstract: Wildlife field operations demand efficient parallel deployment methods to identify and interact with specific individuals, enabling simultaneous collective behavioral analysis, and health and safety interventions. Previous robotics solutions approach the problem from the herd perspective, or are manually operated and limited in scale. We propose a decentralized vision-based multi-quadrotor system for wildlife monitoring that is scalable, low-bandwidth, and sensor-minimal (single onboard RGB camera). Our approach enables robust identification and tracking of large species in their natural habitat. We develop novel vision-based coordination and tracking algorithms designed for dynamic, unstructured environments without reliance on centralized communication or control. We validate our system through real-world experiments, demonstrating reliable deployment in diverse field conditions.

<title>Side Effects of Erasing Concepts from Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy, copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques (CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired ``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on robust concept erasure.

<title>Zero-shot Volumetric CT Super-Resolution using 3D Gaussian Splatting with Upsampled 2D X-ray Projection Priors</title>

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these, we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows) without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The codebase is open-sourced at https://github.com/hantaoZhangrichard/see_it_say_it_sorted.git.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis. While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process, facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology. Code: https://github.com/QuIIL/AnoPILaD.

Abstract: This study comprehensively explores knowledge distillation frameworks for COVID-19 and lung cancer classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images. We employ high-capacity teacher models, including VGG19 and lightweight Vision Transformers (Visformer-S and AutoFormer-V2-T), to guide the training of a compact, hardware-aware student model derived from the OFA-595 supernet. Our approach leverages hybrid supervision, combining ground-truth labels with teacher models' soft targets to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. We validate our models on two benchmark datasets: COVID-QU-Ex and LCS25000, covering multiple classes, including COVID-19, healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, lung, and colon cancer. To interpret the spatial focus of the models, we employ Score-CAM-based visualizations, which provide insight into the reasoning process of both teacher and student networks. The results demonstrate that the distilled student model maintains high classification performance with significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it an optimal choice in resource-constrained clinical environments. Our work underscores the importance of combining model efficiency with explainability for practical, trustworthy medical AI solutions.

Abstract: Clinical cystoscopy, the current standard for bladder cancer diagnosis, suffers from significant reliance on physician expertise, leading to variability and subjectivity in diagnostic outcomes. There is an urgent need for objective, accurate, and efficient computational approaches to improve bladder cancer diagnostics.
  Leveraging recent advancements in deep learning, this study proposes an integrated multi-task deep learning framework specifically designed for bladder cancer diagnosis from cystoscopic images. Our framework includes a robust classification model using EfficientNet-B0 enhanced with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), an advanced segmentation model based on ResNet34-UNet++ architecture with self-attention mechanisms and attention gating, and molecular subtyping using ConvNeXt-Tiny to classify molecular markers such as HER-2 and Ki-67. Additionally, we introduce a Gradio-based online diagnostic platform integrating all developed models, providing intuitive features including multi-format image uploads, bilingual interfaces, and dynamic threshold adjustments.
  Extensive experimentation demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods, achieving outstanding accuracy (93.28%), F1-score (82.05%), and AUC (96.41%) for classification tasks, and exceptional segmentation performance indicated by a Dice coefficient of 0.9091. The online platform significantly improved the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of clinical bladder cancer diagnostics, enabling practical and user-friendly deployment. The code is publicly available.
  Our multi-task framework and integrated online tool collectively advance the field of intelligent bladder cancer diagnosis by improving clinical reliability, supporting early tumor detection, and enabling real-time diagnostic feedback. These contributions mark a significant step toward AI-assisted decision-making in urology.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment in operational logistics and construction environments.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications, recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster further research.

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their performance often declines when applied to data from different domains, primarily due to domain shift - the variation in data distributions between source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets - including HCTP, a newly introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset - we conduct a systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme, yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and generalizable mammography classification systems.

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando (tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach, as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and absorption information.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Are Virtual DES Images a Valid Alternative to the Real Ones?</title>

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial, potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes clinically viable.

<title>Label Uncertainty for Ultrasound Segmentation</title>

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically, estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%) confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI in medical imaging.

<title>Hessian-based lightweight neural network for brain vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset</title>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter, which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset (annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the most complex important cases. The dataset is available at https://git.scinalytics.com/terilat/VesselDatasetPartly.

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule. Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized. Interactive visualizations of the dynamics studied in this work are available at https://memorynca.github.io/2D.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work. However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

Abstract: Interactive digital maps have revolutionized how people travel and learn about the world; however, they rely on pre-existing structured data in GIS databases (e.g., road networks, POI indices), limiting their ability to address geo-visual questions related to what the world looks like. We introduce our vision for Geo-Visual Agents--multimodal AI agents capable of understanding and responding to nuanced visual-spatial inquiries about the world by analyzing large-scale repositories of geospatial images, including streetscapes (e.g., Google Street View), place-based photos (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp), and aerial imagery (e.g., satellite photos) combined with traditional GIS data sources. We define our vision, describe sensing and interaction approaches, provide three exemplars, and enumerate key challenges and opportunities for future work.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged, achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters, continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic stabilities for crystals.

Abstract: The extraction of road network is essential for the generation of high-definition maps since it enables the precise localization of road landmarks and their interconnections. However, generating road network poses a significant challenge due to the conflicting underlying combination of Euclidean (e.g., road landmarks location) and non-Euclidean (e.g., road topological connectivity) structures. Existing methods struggle to merge the two types of data domains effectively, but few of them address it properly. Instead, our work establishes a unified representation of both types of data domain by projecting both Euclidean and non-Euclidean data into an integer series called RoadNet Sequence. Further than modeling an auto-regressive sequence-to-sequence Transformer model to understand RoadNet Sequence, we decouple the dependency of RoadNet Sequence into a mixture of auto-regressive and non-autoregressive dependency. Building on this, our proposed non-autoregressive sequence-to-sequence approach leverages non-autoregressive dependencies while fixing the gap towards auto-regressive dependencies, resulting in success in both efficiency and accuracy. We further identify two main bottlenecks in the current RoadNetTransformer on a non-overfitting split of the dataset: poor landmark detection limited by the BEV Encoder and error propagation to topology reasoning. Therefore, we propose Topology-Inherited Training to inherit better topology knowledge into RoadNetTransformer. Additionally, we collect SD-Maps from open-source map datasets and use this prior information to significantly improve landmark detection and reachability. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the superiority of RoadNet Sequence representation and the non-autoregressive approach compared to existing state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Multiview Structure from Motion is a fundamental and challenging computer vision problem. A recent deep-based approach utilized matrix equivariant architectures for simultaneous recovery of camera pose and 3D scene structure from large image collections. That work, however, made the unrealistic assumption that the point tracks given as input are almost clean of outliers. Here, we propose an architecture suited to dealing with outliers by adding a multiview inlier/outlier classification module that respects the model equivariance and by utilizing a robust bundle adjustment step. Experiments demonstrate that our method can be applied successfully in realistic settings that include large image collections and point tracks extracted with common heuristics that include many outliers, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies in almost all runs, superior to existing deep-based methods and on-par with leading classical (non-deep) sequential and global methods.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation aims to segment objects from previously unseen classes using only a limited number of labeled examples. In this paper, we introduce Label Anything, a novel transformer-based architecture designed for multi-prompt, multi-way few-shot semantic segmentation. Our approach leverages diverse visual prompts -- points, bounding boxes, and masks -- to create a highly flexible and generalizable framework that significantly reduces annotation burden while maintaining high accuracy. Label Anything makes three key contributions: ($\textit{i}$) we introduce a new task formulation that relaxes conventional few-shot segmentation constraints by supporting various types of prompts, multi-class classification, and enabling multiple prompts within a single image; ($\textit{ii}$) we propose a novel architecture based on transformers and attention mechanisms; and ($\textit{iii}$) we design a versatile training procedure allowing our model to operate seamlessly across different $N$-way $K$-shot and prompt-type configurations with a single trained model. Our extensive experimental evaluation on the widely used COCO-$20^i$ benchmark demonstrates that Label Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing multi-way few-shot segmentation methods, while significantly outperforming leading single-class models when evaluated in multi-class settings. Code and trained models are available at https://github.com/pasqualedem/LabelAnything.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking is critical for applications like surveillance, search-and-rescue, and autonomous navigation. However, the high-speed movement of UAVs and targets introduces unique challenges, including real-time processing demands and severe motion blur, which degrade the performance of existing generic trackers. While single-stream vision transformer (ViT) architectures have shown promise in visual tracking, their computational inefficiency and lack of UAV-specific optimizations limit their practicality in this domain. In this paper, we boost the efficiency of this framework by tailoring it into an adaptive computation framework that dynamically exits Transformer blocks for real-time UAV tracking. The motivation behind this is that tracking tasks with fewer challenges can be adequately addressed using low-level feature representations. Simpler tasks can often be handled with less demanding, lower-level features. This approach allows the model use computational resources more efficiently by focusing on complex tasks and conserving resources for easier ones. Another significant enhancement introduced in this paper is the improved effectiveness of ViTs in handling motion blur, a common issue in UAV tracking caused by the fast movements of either the UAV, the tracked objects, or both. This is achieved by acquiring motion blur robust representations through enforcing invariance in the feature representation of the target with respect to simulated motion blur. We refer to our proposed approach as BDTrack. Extensive experiments conducted on four tracking benchmarks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach, demonstrating its potential as a practical and effective approach for real-time UAV tracking. Code is released at: https://github.com/wuyou3474/BDTrack.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image synthesis, particularly with the advent of GAN and Diffusion models, have amplified public concerns regarding the dissemination of disinformation. To address such concerns, numerous AI-generated Image (AIGI) Detectors have been proposed and achieved promising performance in identifying fake images. However, there still lacks a systematic understanding of the adversarial robustness of AIGI detectors. In this paper, we examine the vulnerability of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors against adversarial attack under white-box and black-box settings, which has been rarely investigated so far. To this end, we propose a new method to attack AIGI detectors. First, inspired by the obvious difference between real images and fake images in the frequency domain, we add perturbations under the frequency domain to push the image away from its original frequency distribution. Second, we explore the full posterior distribution of the surrogate model to further narrow this gap between heterogeneous AIGI detectors, e.g. transferring adversarial examples across CNNs and ViTs. This is achieved by introducing a novel post-train Bayesian strategy that turns a single surrogate into a Bayesian one, capable of simulating diverse victim models using one pre-trained surrogate, without the need for re-training. We name our method as Frequency-based Post-train Bayesian Attack, or FPBA. Through FPBA, we show that adversarial attack is truly a real threat to AIGI detectors, because FPBA can deliver successful black-box attacks across models, generators, defense methods, and even evade cross-generator detection, which is a crucial real-world detection scenario. The code will be shared upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multiple object tracking (MOT) depends heavily on selection of true positive detected bounding boxes. However, this aspect of the problem is mostly overlooked or mitigated by employing two-stage association and utilizing low confidence detections in the second stage. Recently proposed BoostTrack attempts to avoid the drawbacks of multiple stage association approach and use low-confidence detections by applying detection confidence boosting. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the confidence boost used in BoostTrack and propose a method to improve its performance. To construct a richer similarity measure and enable a better selection of true positive detections, we propose to use a combination of shape, Mahalanobis distance and novel soft BIoU similarity. We propose a soft detection confidence boost technique which calculates new confidence scores based on the similarity measure and the previous confidence scores, and we introduce varying similarity threshold to account for lower similarity measure between detections and tracklets which are not regularly updated. The proposed additions are mutually independent and can be used in any MOT algorithm.
  Combined with the BoostTrack+ baseline, our method achieves near state of the art results on the MOT17 dataset and new state of the art HOTA and IDF1 scores on the MOT20 dataset.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as snow, fog, and rain pose significant challenges to LiDAR-based perception models by introducing noise and corrupting point cloud measurements. To address this issue, we propose TripleMixer, a robust and efficient point cloud denoising network that integrates spatial, frequency, and channel-wise processing through three specialized mixer modules. TripleMixer effectively suppresses high-frequency noise while preserving essential geometric structures and can be seamlessly deployed as a plug-and-play module within existing LiDAR perception pipelines. To support the development and evaluation of denoising methods, we construct two large-scale simulated datasets, Weather-KITTI and Weather-NuScenes, covering diverse weather scenarios with dense point-wise semantic and noise annotations. Based on these datasets, we establish four benchmarks: Denoising, Semantic Segmentation (SS), Place Recognition (PR), and Object Detection (OD). These benchmarks enable systematic evaluation of denoising generalization, transferability, and downstream impact under both simulated and real-world adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TripleMixer achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance and yields substantial improvements across all downstream tasks without requiring retraining. Our results highlight the potential of denoising as a task-agnostic preprocessing strategy to enhance LiDAR robustness in real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: We present 3DGS-LM, a new method that accelerates the reconstruction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by replacing its ADAM optimizer with a tailored Levenberg-Marquardt (LM). Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 20% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in coarse-grained video understanding, however, they struggle with fine-grained temporal grounding. In this paper, we introduce Grounded-VideoLLM, a novel Video-LLM adept at perceiving and reasoning over specific video moments in a fine-grained manner. We identify that current Video-LLMs have limitations for fine-grained video understanding since they lack effective temporal modeling and timestamp representation. In light of this, we sharpen our model by incorporating (1) an additional temporal stream to encode the relationships between frames and (2) discrete temporal tokens enriched with specific time knowledge to represent timestamps. To optimize the training of Grounded-VideoLLM, we employ a multi-stage training scheme, beginning with simple video-captioning tasks and progressively introducing video temporal grounding tasks of increasing complexity. To further enhance Grounded-VideoLLM's temporal reasoning capability, we also curate a grounded VideoQA dataset by an automatic annotation pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grounded-VideoLLM not only excels in fine-grained grounding tasks such as temporal sentence grounding, dense video captioning, and grounded VideoQA, but also shows great potential as a versatile video assistant for general video understanding.

Abstract: Large text-to-image models demonstrate impressive generation capabilities; however, their substantial size necessitates expensive cloud servers for deployment. Conversely, light-weight models can be deployed on edge devices at lower cost but often with inferior generation quality for complex user prompts. To strike a balance between performance and cost, we propose a routing framework, called RouteT2I, which dynamically selects either the large cloud model or the light-weight edge model for each user prompt. Since generated image quality is challenging to measure and compare directly, RouteT2I establishes multi-dimensional quality metrics, particularly, by evaluating the similarity between the generated images and both positive and negative texts that describe each specific quality metric. RouteT2I then predicts the expected quality of the generated images by identifying key tokens in the prompt and comparing their impact on the quality. RouteT2I further introduces the Pareto relative superiority to compare the multi-metric quality of the generated images. Based on this comparison and predefined cost constraints, RouteT2I allocates prompts to either the edge or the cloud. Evaluation reveals that RouteT2I significantly reduces the number of requesting large cloud model while maintaining high-quality image generation.

<title>Evaluation Agent: Efficient and Promptable Evaluation Framework for Visual Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in visual generative models have enabled high-quality image and video generation, opening diverse applications. However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.

Abstract: Constrained by the low-rank bottleneck inherent in attention mechanisms, current stereo matching transformers suffer from limited nonlinear expressivity, which renders their feature representations sensitive to challenging conditions such as reflections. To overcome this difficulty, we present the Hadamard Attention Recurrent Stereo Transformer (HART). HART includes a novel attention mechanism that incorporates the following components: 1) The Dense Attention Kernel (DAK) maps the attention weight distribution into a high-dimensional space over (0, +$\infty$). By removing the upper bound constraint on attention weights, DAK enables more flexible modeling of complex feature interactions. This reduces feature collinearity. 2) The Multi Kernel & Order Interaction (MKOI) module extends the attention mechanism by unifying semantic and spatial knowledge learning. This integration improves the ability of HART to learn features in binocular images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our HART. In reflective area, HART ranked 1st on the KITTI 2012 benchmark among all published methods at the time of submission. Code is available at https://github.com/ZYangChen/HART.

Abstract: Visual embedding models excel at zero-shot tasks like visual retrieval and classification. However, these models cannot be used for tasks that contain ambiguity or require user instruction. These tasks necessitate an embedding model which outputs can use a natural language instruction to control the representation of a visual embedding. Existing CLIP-based approaches embed images and text independently, and fuse the result. We find that this results in weak interactions between modalities, and poor user control over the representation. We introduce ABC, an open-source multimodal embedding model that uses a vision-language model backbone to deeply integrate image features with natural language instructions. ABC achieves best-for-size performance on MSCOCO image-to-text retrieval and is the top performing model on classification and VQA tasks in the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark. With a strongly unified vision-language representation, ABC can use natural language to solve subtle and potentially ambiguous visual retrieval problems. To evaluate this capability, we design CtrlBench, a benchmark that requires interleaving textual instructions with image content for correct retrieval. ABC advances the state of visual embeddings, outputting high-quality visual representations with natural language control. Our model and datasets are available at our project page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/ABC/

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) inputs pose a persistent challenge to deep learning models, often triggering overconfident predictions on non-target objects. While prior work has primarily focused on refining scoring functions and adjusting test-time thresholds, such algorithmic improvements offer only incremental gains. We argue that a rethinking of the entire development lifecycle is needed to mitigate these risks effectively. This work addresses two overlooked dimensions of OoD detection in object detection. First, we reveal fundamental flaws in widely used evaluation benchmarks: contrary to their design intent, up to 13% of objects in the OoD test sets actually belong to in-distribution classes, and vice versa. These quality issues severely distort the reported performance of existing methods and contribute to their high false positive rates. Second, we introduce a novel training-time mitigation paradigm that operates independently of external OoD detectors. Instead of relying solely on post-hoc scoring, we fine-tune the detector using a carefully synthesized OoD dataset that semantically resembles in-distribution objects. This process shapes a defensive decision boundary by suppressing objectness on OoD objects, leading to a 91% reduction in hallucination error of a YOLO model on BDD-100K. Our methodology generalizes across detection paradigms such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR, and supports few-shot adaptation. Together, these contributions offer a principled and effective way to reduce OoD-induced hallucination in object detectors.

Abstract: Advertising banners are critical for capturing user attention and enhancing advertising campaign effectiveness. Creating aesthetically pleasing banner designs while conveying the campaign messages is challenging due to the large search space involving multiple design elements. Additionally, advertisers need multiple sizes for different displays and various versions to target different sectors of audiences. Since design is intrinsically an iterative and subjective process, flexible editability is also in high demand for practical usage. While current models have served as assistants to human designers in various design tasks, they typically handle only segments of the creative design process or produce pixel-based outputs that limit editability. This paper introduces a training-free framework for fully automated banner ad design creation, enabling frontier multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to streamline the production of effective banners with minimal manual effort across diverse marketing contexts. We present BannerAgency, an MLLM agent system that collaborates with advertisers to understand their brand identity and banner objectives, generates matching background images, creates blueprints for foreground design elements, and renders the final creatives as editable components in Figma or SVG formats rather than static pixels. To facilitate evaluation and future research, we introduce BannerRequest400, a benchmark featuring 100 unique logos paired with 400 diverse banner requests. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, emphasizing the quality of the generated banner designs, their adaptability to various banner requests, and their strong editability enabled by this component-based approach.

Abstract: We introduce \dataset (Procedural Knowledge Reasoning Question Answering), a new benchmark for question answering over procedural tasks that require structured reasoning. PKR-QA is constructed semi-automatically using a procedural knowledge graph (PKG), which encodes task-specific knowledge across diverse domains. The PKG is built by curating and linking information from the COIN instructional video dataset and the ontology, enriched with commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet and structured outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), followed by manual verification. To generate question-answer pairs, we design graph traversal templates where each template is applied systematically over PKG. To enable interpretable reasoning, we propose a neurosymbolic approach called Knowledge Module Learning (KML), which learns procedural relations via neural modules and composes them for structured reasoning with LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that this paradigm improves reasoning performance on our dataset and enables step-by-step reasoning traces that facilitate interpretability. Our theoretical analysis on KML learning shows that our trained models satisfy near optimal conditions for learning KG relations as neural network mapping models. Code and dataset will be released soon.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking, player identification, and pose estimation are fundamental components of sports analytics, essential for analyzing player movements, performance, and tactical strategies. However, existing datasets and methodologies primarily target mainstream team sports such as soccer and conventional 5-on-5 basketball, often overlooking scenarios involving fixed-camera setups commonly used at amateur levels, less mainstream sports, or datasets that explicitly incorporate pose annotations. In this paper, we propose the TrackID3x3 dataset, the first publicly available comprehensive dataset specifically designed for multi-player tracking, player identification, and pose estimation in 3x3 basketball scenarios. The dataset comprises three distinct subsets (Indoor fixed-camera, Outdoor fixed-camera, and Drone camera footage), capturing diverse full-court camera perspectives and environments. We also introduce the Track-ID task, a simplified variant of the game state reconstruction task that excludes field detection and focuses exclusively on fixed-camera scenarios. To evaluate performance, we propose a baseline algorithm called Track-ID algorithm, tailored to assess tracking and identification quality. Furthermore, our benchmark experiments, utilizing recent multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., BoT-SORT-ReID) and top-down pose estimation methods (HRNet, RTMPose, and SwinPose), demonstrate robust results and highlight remaining challenges. Our dataset and evaluation benchmarks provide a solid foundation for advancing automated analytics in 3x3 basketball. Dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/open-starlab/TrackID3x3.

Abstract: Co-speech gestures play a vital role in non-verbal communication. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for co-speech gesture understanding in the wild. Specifically, we propose three new tasks and benchmarks to evaluate a model's capability to comprehend gesture-speech-text associations: (i) gesture based retrieval, (ii) gesture word spotting, and (iii) active speaker detection using gestures. We present a new approach that learns a tri-modal video-gesture-speech-text representation to solve these tasks. By leveraging a combination of global phrase contrastive loss and local gesture-word coupling loss, we demonstrate that a strong gesture representation can be learned in a weakly supervised manner from videos in the wild. Our learned representations outperform previous methods, including large vision-language models (VLMs). Further analysis reveals that speech and text modalities capture distinct gesture related signals, underscoring the advantages of learning a shared tri-modal embedding space. The dataset, model, and code are available at: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/jegal.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generalizable Gaussian Splatting have enabled robust 3D reconstruction from sparse input views by utilizing feed-forward Gaussian Splatting models, achieving superior cross-scene generalization. However, while many methods focus on geometric consistency, they often neglect the potential of text-driven guidance to enhance semantic understanding, which is crucial for accurately reconstructing fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose TextSplat--the first text-driven Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework. By employing a text-guided fusion of diverse semantic cues, our framework learns robust cross-modal feature representations that improve the alignment of geometric and semantic information, producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Specifically, our framework employs three parallel modules to obtain complementary representations: the Diffusion Prior Depth Estimator for accurate depth information, the Semantic Aware Segmentation Network for detailed semantic information, and the Multi-View Interaction Network for refined cross-view features. Then, in the Text-Guided Semantic Fusion Module, these representations are integrated via the text-guided and attention-based feature aggregation mechanism, resulting in enhanced 3D Gaussian parameters enriched with detailed semantic cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: $360^{\circ}$ omnidirectional images (ODIs) have gained considerable attention recently, and are widely used in various virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications. However, capturing such images is expensive and requires specialized equipment, making ODI synthesis increasingly important. While common 2D image generation and editing methods are rapidly advancing, these models struggle to deliver satisfactory results when generating or editing ODIs due to the unique format and broad 360$^{\circ}$ Field-of-View (FoV) of ODIs. To bridge this gap, we construct \textbf{\textit{Any2Omni}}, the first comprehensive ODI generation-editing dataset comprises 60,000+ training data covering diverse input conditions and up to 9 ODI generation and editing tasks. Built upon Any2Omni, we propose an \textbf{\underline{Omni}} model for \textbf{\underline{Omni}}-directional image generation and editing (\textbf{\textit{Omni$^2$}}), with the capability of handling various ODI generation and editing tasks under diverse input conditions using one model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed Omni$^2$ model for both the ODI generation and editing tasks. Both the Any2Omni dataset and the Omni$^2$ model are publicly available at: https://github.com/IntMeGroup/Omni2.

Abstract: We propose FastMap, a new global structure from motion method focused on speed and simplicity. Previous methods like COLMAP and GLOMAP are able to estimate high-precision camera poses, but suffer from poor scalability when the number of matched keypoint pairs becomes large, mainly due to the time-consuming process of second-order Gauss-Newton optimization. Instead, we design our method solely based on first-order optimizers. To obtain maximal speedup, we identify and eliminate two key performance bottlenecks: computational complexity and the kernel implementation of each optimization step. Through extensive experiments, we show that FastMap is up to 10 times faster than COLMAP and GLOMAP with GPU acceleration and achieves comparable pose accuracy.

Abstract: Imitation learning for manipulation has a well-known data scarcity problem. Unlike natural language and 2D computer vision, there is no Internet-scale corpus of data for dexterous manipulation. One appealing option is egocentric human video, a passively scalable data source. However, existing large-scale datasets such as Ego4D do not have native hand pose annotations and do not focus on object manipulation. To this end, we use Apple Vision Pro to collect EgoDex: the largest and most diverse dataset of dexterous human manipulation to date. EgoDex has 829 hours of egocentric video with paired 3D hand and finger tracking data collected at the time of recording, where multiple calibrated cameras and on-device SLAM can be used to precisely track the pose of every joint of each hand. The dataset covers a wide range of diverse manipulation behaviors with everyday household objects in 194 different tabletop tasks ranging from tying shoelaces to folding laundry. Furthermore, we train and systematically evaluate imitation learning policies for hand trajectory prediction on the dataset, introducing metrics and benchmarks for measuring progress in this increasingly important area. By releasing this large-scale dataset, we hope to push the frontier of robotics, computer vision, and foundation models. EgoDex is publicly available for download at https://github.com/apple/ml-egodex.

Abstract: This article presents a large-scale effort to create a structured dataset of internal migration in Finland between 1800 and 1920 using digitized church moving records. These records, maintained by Evangelical-Lutheran parishes, document the migration of individuals and families and offer a valuable source for studying historical demographic patterns. The dataset includes over six million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten migration records.
  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a structured dataset suitable for research.
  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland. A case study from the Elim\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be reconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival material can be transformed into structured data to support historical and demographic research.

Abstract: Using natural language to query visual information is a fundamental need in real-world applications. Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves a target image from a gallery based on an image-level description, while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes a target object within a given image using an instance-level description. However, real-world applications often present more complex demands. Users typically query an instance-level description across a large gallery and expect to receive both relevant image and the corresponding instance location. In such scenarios, TIR struggles with fine-grained descriptions and object-level localization, while REC is limited in its ability to efficiently search large galleries and lacks an effective ranking mechanism. In this paper, we introduce a new task called \textbf{Referring Expression Instance Retrieval (REIR)}, which supports both instance-level retrieval and localization based on fine-grained referring expressions. First, we propose a large-scale benchmark for REIR, named REIRCOCO, constructed by prompting advanced vision-language models to generate high-quality referring expressions for instances in the MSCOCO and RefCOCO datasets. Second, we present a baseline method, Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment with Relation Experts (CLARE), which employs a dual-stream architecture to address REIR in an end-to-end manner. Given a referring expression, the textual branch encodes it into a query embedding. The visual branch detects candidate objects and extracts their instance-level visual features. The most similar candidate to the query is selected for bounding box prediction. CLARE is first trained on object detection and REC datasets to establish initial grounding capabilities, then optimized via Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for improved retrieval across images. We will release our code and benchmark publicly.

Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) video acquisition using the alternating exposure (AE) paradigm has garnered significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness with a single consumer camera. However, despite progress driven by deep neural networks, these methods remain prone to temporal flicker in real-world applications due to inter-frame exposure inconsistencies. To address this challenge while maintaining the cost-effectiveness of the AE paradigm, we propose a novel learning-based HDR video generation solution. Specifically, we propose a dual-stream HDR video generation paradigm that decouples temporal luminance anchoring from exposure-variant detail reconstruction, overcoming the inherent limitations of the AE paradigm. To support this, we design an asynchronous dual-camera system (DCS), which enables independent exposure control across two cameras, eliminating the need for synchronization typically required in traditional multi-camera setups. Furthermore, an exposure-adaptive fusion network (EAFNet) is formulated for the DCS system. EAFNet integrates a pre-alignment subnetwork that aligns features across varying exposures, ensuring robust feature extraction for subsequent fusion, an asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork that emphasizes reference-based attention to effectively merge these features across exposures, and a reconstruction subnetwork to mitigate ghosting artifacts and preserve fine details. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, showing the remarkable potential of our solution in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured by DCS will be available at https://zqqqyu.github.io/DCS-HDR/.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions. Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process. Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in radiology report generation.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting 3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for prognostic models in this context.

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it, we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming efficiency.

<title>Synthesizing Near-Boundary OOD Samples for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space, can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced, boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score, effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly surpasses existing methods, and the code is available at https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Abstract: Image captioning, situated at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic, iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. This paper presents a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic attention mechanism. The experiments chart the impact of architectural enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, the final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several foundational benchmarks and validating the iterative design process. This work provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

<title>The Devil is in the EOS: Sequence Training for Detailed Image Captioning</title>

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose image editing. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/oyly16/LORE.

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections, and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally, we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at https://github.com/PWonjung/LV_Shape_Modeling.

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references, combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However, current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs -- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references. We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990 synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33 reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

Abstract: Murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, face continuous deterioration from environmental factors and human activities. Digital restoration of murals faces unique challenges due to their complex degradation patterns and the critical need to preserve artistic authenticity. Existing learning-based methods struggle with maintaining consistent mask guidance throughout their networks, leading to insufficient focus on damaged regions and compromised restoration quality. We propose CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network that addresses these limitations through comprehensive mask guidance and multi-scale feature extraction. Our framework introduces two key components: (1) the Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS), which ensures consistent mask sensitivity across resolution scales through dedicated channel-wise feature selection and mask-guided feature fusion; and (2) the Co-Feature Aggregator (CFA), operating at both the highest and lowest resolutions to extract complementary features for capturing fine textures and global structures in degraded regions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively preserving both structural integrity and artistic details in restored murals.

Abstract: Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy, overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks), their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for more robust multimodal evaluation.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation, these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA), which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in). Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible, well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a topdown approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models.

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slides. Existing methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts, HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by 5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved unprecedented success in computer vision. However, they remain underutilized in medical imaging, a field crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. This is primarily due to the high computational cost associated with (1) the use of large number of time steps (e.g., 1,000) in diffusion processes and (2) the increased dimensionality of medical images, which are often 3D or 4D. Training a diffusion model on medical images typically takes days to weeks, while sampling each image volume takes minutes to hours. To address this challenge, we introduce Fast-DDPM, a simple yet effective approach capable of improving training speed, sampling speed, and generation quality simultaneously. Unlike DDPM, which trains the image denoiser across 1,000 time steps, Fast-DDPM trains and samples using only 10 time steps. The key to our method lies in aligning the training and sampling procedures to optimize time-step utilization. Specifically, we introduced two efficient noise schedulers with 10 time steps: one with uniform time step sampling and another with non-uniform sampling. We evaluated Fast-DDPM across three medical image-to-image generation tasks: multi-image super-resolution, image denoising, and image-to-image translation. Fast-DDPM outperformed DDPM and current state-of-the-art methods based on convolutional networks and generative adversarial networks in all tasks. Additionally, Fast-DDPM reduced the training time to 0.2x and the sampling time to 0.01x compared to DDPM. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/Fast-DDPM.

Abstract: Intelligent agents must autonomously interact with the environments to perform daily tasks based on human-level instructions. They need a foundational understanding of the world to accurately interpret these instructions, along with precise low-level movement and interaction skills to execute the derived actions. In this work, we propose the first complete system for synthesizing physically plausible, long-horizon human-object interactions for object manipulation in contextual environments, driven by human-level instructions. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to interpret the input instructions into detailed execution plans. Unlike prior work, our system is capable of generating detailed finger-object interactions, in seamless coordination with full-body movements. We also train a policy to track generated motions in physics simulation via reinforcement learning (RL) to ensure physical plausibility of the motion. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in synthesizing realistic interactions with diverse objects in complex environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: We express parallel transport for several common matrix Lie groups with a family of pseudo-Riemannian metrics in terms of matrix exponential and exponential actions. The metrics are constructed from a deformation of a bi-invariant metric and are naturally reductive. There is a similar picture for homogeneous spaces when taking quotients satisfying a general condition. In particular, for a Stiefel manifold of orthogonal matrices of size $n\times d$, we give an expression for parallel transport along a geodesic from time zero to $t$, that could be computed with time complexity of $O(n d^2)$ for small $t$, and of $O(td^3)$ for large $t$, contributing a step in a long-standing open problem in matrix manifolds. A similar result holds for {\it flag manifolds} with the canonical metric. We also show the parallel transport formulas for the {\it general linear group} and the {\it special orthogonal group} under these metrics.

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is a promising approach for teaching robots new skills. However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur. We provide all the code and data required to reproduce our experiments at imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/ilesia.

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation is an essential task in pathology image analysis, serving as the foundation for many downstream applications. The release of several public datasets has significantly advanced research in this area, yet many existing methods struggle with data imbalance issues. To address this challenge, this study introduces a data augmentation method, called NucleiMix, which is designed to balance the distribution of nuclei types by increasing the number of rare-type nuclei within datasets. NucleiMix operates in two phases. In the first phase, it identifies candidate locations similar to the surroundings of rare-type nuclei and inserts rare-type nuclei into the candidate locations. In the second phase, it employs a progressive inpainting strategy using a pre-trained diffusion model to seamlessly integrate rare-type nuclei into their new environments in replacement of major-type nuclei or background locations. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of NucleiMix on three public datasets using two popular nuclei instance segmentation models. The results demonstrate the superior ability of NucleiMix to synthesize realistic rare-type nuclei and to enhance the quality of nuclei segmentation and classification in an accurate and robust manner.

Abstract: Medical image reconstruction from undersampled acquisitions is an ill-posed inverse problem requiring accurate recovery of anatomical structures from incomplete measurements. Physics-driven (PD) network models have gained prominence for this task by integrating data-consistency mechanisms with learned priors, enabling improved performance over purely data-driven approaches. However, reconstruction quality still hinges on the network's ability to disentangle artifacts from true anatomical signals-both of which exhibit complex, multi-scale contextual structure. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture local correlations but often struggle with non-local dependencies. While transformers aim to alleviate this limitation, practical implementations involve design compromises to reduce computational cost by balancing local and non-local sensitivity, occasionally resulting in performance comparable to CNNs. To address these challenges, we propose MambaRoll, a novel physics-driven autoregressive state space model (SSM) for high-fidelity and efficient image reconstruction. MambaRoll employs an unrolled architecture where each cascade autoregressively predicts finer-scale feature maps conditioned on coarser-scale representations, enabling consistent multi-scale context propagation. Each stage is built on a hierarchy of scale-specific PD-SSM modules that capture spatial dependencies while enforcing data consistency through residual correction. To further improve scale-aware learning, we introduce a Deep Multi-Scale Decoding (DMSD) loss, which provides supervision at intermediate spatial scales in alignment with the autoregressive design. Demonstrations on accelerated MRI and sparse-view CT reconstructions show that MambaRoll consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-, transformer-, and SSM-based methods.

Abstract: In image processing, solving inverse problems is the task of finding plausible reconstructions of an image that was corrupted by some (usually known) degradation operator. Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We name our method LD-SMC. We define a generative model for the data using additional auxiliary observations and perform posterior inference with SMC sampling based on a reverse diffusion process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of LD-SMC over competing methods in various inverse problem tasks and especially in challenging inpainting tasks.

<title>MaskSDM with Shapley values to improve flexibility, robustness, and explainability in species distribution modeling</title>

Abstract: Species Distribution Models (SDMs) play a vital role in biodiversity research, conservation planning, and ecological niche modeling by predicting species distributions based on environmental conditions. The selection of predictors is crucial, strongly impacting both model accuracy and how well the predictions reflect ecological patterns. To ensure meaningful insights, input variables must be carefully chosen to match the study objectives and the ecological requirements of the target species. However, existing SDMs, including both traditional and deep learning-based approaches, often lack key capabilities for variable selection: (i) flexibility to choose relevant predictors at inference without retraining; (ii) robustness to handle missing predictor values without compromising accuracy; and (iii) explainability to interpret and accurately quantify each predictor's contribution. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MaskSDM, a novel deep learning-based SDM that enables flexible predictor selection by employing a masked training strategy. This approach allows the model to make predictions with arbitrary subsets of input variables while remaining robust to missing data. It also provides a clearer understanding of how adding or removing a given predictor affects model performance and predictions. Additionally, MaskSDM leverages Shapley values for precise predictor contribution assessments, improving upon traditional approximations. We evaluate MaskSDM on the global sPlotOpen dataset, modeling the distributions of 12,738 plant species. Our results show that MaskSDM outperforms imputation-based methods and approximates models trained on specific subsets of variables. These findings underscore MaskSDM's potential to increase the applicability and adoption of SDMs, laying the groundwork for developing foundation models in SDMs that can be readily applied to diverse ecological applications.

<title>CaLiV: LiDAR-to-Vehicle Calibration of Arbitrary Sensor Setups</title>

Abstract: In autonomous systems, sensor calibration is essential for safe and efficient navigation in dynamic environments. Accurate calibration is a prerequisite for reliable perception and planning tasks such as object detection and obstacle avoidance. Many existing LiDAR calibration methods require overlapping fields of view, while others use external sensing devices or postulate a feature-rich environment. In addition, Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration is not supported by the vast majority of calibration algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel target-based technique for extrinsic Sensor-to-Sensor and Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration of multi-LiDAR systems called CaLiV. This algorithm works for non-overlapping fields of view and does not require any external sensing devices. First, we apply motion to produce field of view overlaps and utilize a simple Unscented Kalman Filter to obtain vehicle poses. Then, we use the Gaussian mixture model-based registration framework GMMCalib to align the point clouds in a common calibration frame. Finally, we reduce the task of recovering the sensor extrinsics to a minimization problem. We show that both translational and rotational Sensor-to-Sensor errors can be solved accurately by our method. In addition, all Sensor-to-Vehicle rotation angles can also be calibrated with high accuracy. We validate the simulation results in real-world experiments. The code is open-source and available on https://github.com/TUMFTM/CaLiV.

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free, handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh deformations.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Summary:
This research focuses on studying positive sampling Kantorovich operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. Various operators such as SK, Gaussian, Bilateral, and wavelet-based operators are analyzed for their local and global approximation properties. The study evaluates mathematical parameters like mean square error, speckle index, speckle suppression index, and speckle mean preservation index at different resolution levels. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the significance of these operators in image processing, particularly on 2D image features under non-ideal conditions. The research highlights the importance of selecting appropriate operators based on specific image characteristics for effective image analysis and feature extraction.

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations we observe that the various operators have their own significance while studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a federated learning framework for pose-based human activity recognition in smart manufacturing environments. The framework utilizes a custom skeletal dataset of upper-body gestures and trains two temporal backbones – LSTM and Transformer encoder. Four training paradigms are evaluated: centralized, local, federated learning with weighted federated averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). The results show that the federated learning approach significantly improves accuracy over centralized training, with FedEnsemble delivering the highest gains. Additionally, the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning allows for better cross-user generalization, making it a practical solution for scalable and privacy-aware human activity recognition in diverse industrial environments.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4 percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain. On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by +52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable, privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces LENS, a reinforcement learning framework for text-prompted image segmentation that incorporates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. LENS optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation simultaneously, using unified reinforcement-learning rewards at sentence, box, and segment levels. Through this approach, LENS achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on benchmark datasets, outperforming traditional fine-tuning methods like GLaMM. The results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust prior for text-prompted segmentation and enhances the generalizability of Segment Anything models. The code for LENS is available on GitHub for further exploration and experimentation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available 3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to 5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more generalizable Segment Anything models.

Summary:
Scale variation poses a significant challenge in computer vision tasks, where objects of the same class can appear in different sizes. The perceived size is also influenced by the distance from the camera, leading to local scale variations within an image. To address this issue, a new approach called deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) has been introduced. DEC enhances the local scale equivariance of a model and can be easily integrated into existing network architectures or adapted to pre-trained models. In experiments on the ImageNet benchmark, DEC demonstrated improvements in both model performance and local scale consistency across various deep-nets like ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. The code for DEC implementation is available on GitHub at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance. <div>

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT.

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision, and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant decoder, and the SAPG technique.

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data. In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the regular GCN.

Summary: 
In this paper, a novel learning mechanism is proposed to enhance the alignment between visual and textual features in large multimodal models (LMMs) by addressing shuffling problems. This approach introduces tasks of reconstructing image and text order during pre-training and fine-tuning phases, improving reasoning capability and cross-modality alignment. A directed-token approach captures visual and textual knowledge to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Additionally, an Image-to-Response Guided loss is introduced to enhance the LMM's visual understanding in responses.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures -- ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms, CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis, using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance, and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic, localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data augmentation in dental AI workflows.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity, yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings. This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

<div> Keywords: Explainable object recognition, Vision-language models, CLIP, Multirationale benchmark, Contrastive conditional inference

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper introduces a new benchmark for explainable object recognition that includes multiple ground-truth rationales per image and proposes a contrastive conditional inference (CCI) framework to improve the accuracy of object category predictions. Unlike previous methods that rely on prompt-based conditioning, the CCI framework explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image embeddings, category labels, and rationales, leading to more effective conditioning. The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-rationale benchmark, demonstrating strong zero-shot performance. It sets a new standard for classification accuracy and rationale quality in explainable object recognition tasks. In addition to presenting the benchmark and framework, the paper also promises to release the code online, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating future models in this field. <div>

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally, prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI) framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training, our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object recognition. The code will be made available online.

Summary:
OccluNet is a spatio-temporal deep learning model designed to automate the detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke. Integrating YOLOX and transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms, OccluNet outperformed baseline models trained on individual DSA frames. Two spatio-temporal variants were explored, with both demonstrating similar high performance in capturing temporally consistent features. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN Registry showed OccluNet achieving a precision of 89.02% and a recall of 74.87%. This automated approach could significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of detecting vascular occlusions in complex DSA sequences, providing critical information for medical interventions in acute ischemic stroke cases.

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively. OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at https://github.com/anushka-kore/OccluNet.git

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs, personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles, ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods.

<div> Keywords: intersection over union, object detection, gradient update, relational loss, license plate detection

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel solution to improve gradient updates for small objects in one-stage multi-object detection tasks. Current IoU-based losses struggle to update the gradient of small objects effectively due to their flat nature. To address this, the authors propose an inter-class relational loss that leverages spatial relationships between objects. By penalizing predicted bounding boxes that do not align with their related objects, the proposed loss enhances the learning of small objects without compromising efficiency for larger ones. The study includes the creation of a new dataset for small vehicle multi-license plate detection and the introduction of the inter-class relational loss function. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in mean Average Precision, with gains of 10.3% and 1.6% for different models without additional tuning. The code and dataset will be made available for further research. <div>
arXiv:2508.14343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union (IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper, we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study: (1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance. We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6% in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research. However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive, labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN, which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research in vision-based biomedical analysis.

Summary: 
This paper introduces HRC-Pose, a new depth-only framework for category-level object pose estimation. It utilizes contrastive learning to preserve the continuity of poses by decoupling object pose components into rotation and translation. The proposed hierarchical ranking scheme contrasts point clouds from multiple categories based on 6D pose-aware information, resulting in continuous feature spaces. The method outperforms existing depth-only state-of-the-art methods on REAL275 and CAMERA25 benchmarks and operates in real-time, showcasing its efficiency for real-world applications. HRC-Pose's code is available at https://github.com/zhujunli1993/HRC-Pose.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25 benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications.

This paper introduces a novel method for emotion-controllable talking face generation. The method involves disentangling audio components, quantizing videos into visual tokens, and integrating emotional information using the emotion-anchor representation. An autoregressive transformer is then used to model the distribution of visual tokens and predict index sequences for synthesizing manipulated videos. Experiments conducted on the MEAD dataset showcase the method's superior performance in generating emotion-controllable talking face videos, both qualitatively and quantitatively. <div>
arXiv:2508.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA) representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens. Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization results.

Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) with piecewise quadratic activation functions, known as QuadINR, offer improved performance with reduced hardware consumption. The quadratic functions present rich harmonic content, enhancing expressivity for high-frequency signals. A unified pipeline framework allows efficient hardware implementation of various activation functions in INRs. FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process validate the approach. QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over previous methods while significantly reducing resource and power consumption (up to 97%) and enhancing latency by up to 93% compared to existing baselines. This novel hardware-efficient approach showcases the potential for improving performance in image and video processing while minimizing hardware overhead.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR, a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series, delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW, reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by up to 93\% vs existing baselines.

<div> Keywords: multi-modal AI, spatial transcriptomics, histology images, Img2ST-Net, high-resolution ST prediction

Summary:
Img2ST-Net is a novel framework designed for efficient and parallel prediction of high-resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly from routine histology images. Unlike traditional spot-by-spot methods, Img2ST-Net uses a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense gene expression maps in a parallelized manner, improving computational efficiency and preserving spatial organization. The framework models high-resolution ST data as super-pixel representations, transforming the inference task into a super-content image generation problem with multiple output channels. To address sparse expression patterns, SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for high-resolution ST analysis, is introduced. This scalable and biologically coherent framework provides a principled solution for accurate high-resolution ST inference and sets the foundation for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and resolution-aware. The source code for Img2ST-Net is publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/Img2ST-Net.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges. Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/Img2ST-Net.

<div> adaptation method, Chinese Text Adapter-Flux, text-to-image generative model, Chinese semantics, image generation quality <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux), a method to adapt the Flux text-to-image generative model for Chinese text inputs. Flux, originally trained on English, struggles with non-English prompts due to linguistic and cultural biases. Existing methods like translation or finetuning are limited in addressing cultural specific semantics. CTA-Flux bridges Chinese semantic understanding with English-centric TTI models by leveraging MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to control the Flux backbone directly, improving image generation quality and cultural authenticity. This integration enhances model understanding of Chinese semantics without extensive retraining, maintaining compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins. Empirical evaluations show CTA-Flux supports Chinese and English prompts, achieving superior image generation quality, visual realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics. <div>
arXiv:2508.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets. Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities. Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new approach called Moiré Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive Transformer (MoCHA-former) to address issues with demoiréing in camera-based screen captures. The MoCHA-former consists of two components: Decoupled Moiré Adaptive Demoiréing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoiréing (STAD). DMAD separates moiré and content within frames, producing moiré-adaptive features for restoration. STAD includes a Spatial Fusion Block and Feature Channel Attention to capture large-scale structures and model channel dependence in RAW frames. MoCHA-former also ensures temporal consistency without explicit alignment modules. The approach is evaluated on two video datasets, outperforming prior methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. This new technique offers significant improvements in addressing issues related to moiré patterns in camera-based screen captures. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii) channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing (STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB) and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

Summary:
 
Monocular 3D human pose estimation faces challenges like depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process. Traditional methods may not effectively utilize multi-scale skeleton features, leading to lower accuracy in pose estimation. To tackle these issues, the proposed method, HyperDiff, combines diffusion models with HyperGCN. The diffusion model captures data uncertainty, addressing depth ambiguity and occlusion. HyperGCN acts as a denoiser, utilizing multi-granularity structures to model high-order correlations between joints and improving denoising capability for complex poses. Experimental results show that HyperDiff outperforms existing methods in performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. Moreover, the method can adapt to varying computational resources to balance performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process. Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty, alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance performance and efficiency.

Summary:
The paper introduces FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework, that aims to balance preserving knowledge and adapting to domain shifts. FOCUS utilizes a trained Frequency Prediction Network to disentangle high and low frequency information from noisy images, minimizing computational costs. The approach is trained with a data augmentation method called FrequencyMix to improve robustness to diverse corruptions. FOCUS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation across various corruption types and datasets. It also complements existing model adaptation methods by providing pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional supervision. Even with limited supervision using these pseudo labels, FOCUS mitigates catastrophic forgetting in model adaptation methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However, balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network (Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images. This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands, which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets, achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

Summary: 
Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel in generating images from textual prompts, but struggle with layout control for multi-subject synthesis. The proposed MUSE framework addresses this challenge by integrating layout specifications and textual guidance using concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to align spatial constraints with textual descriptions effectively. MUSE also employs a progressive two-stage training strategy to optimize the task of layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS). Extensive experiments demonstrate MUSE's ability to achieve zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing methods. This advancement in controllable image synthesis is valuable for various applications in computer vision and artificial intelligence. The code and model for MUSE are available on GitHub for further exploration and development.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts. However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the frontier of controllable image synthesis.

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony, the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM) states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45 in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at MultiMediate'25.

arXiv:2508.14449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore, we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization with limited training data.

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently, leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods. We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided, subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

<div> Keywords: egocentric video, head poses prediction, active information-gathering behavior, 3D latent features, Aria Navigation Dataset

Summary:
The article introduces the problem of predicting future 6D head poses from egocentric videos, focusing on head translations and rotations to capture active information-gathering behaviors like head-turning events. A framework is proposed that leverages temporally aggregated 3D latent features to model both static and dynamic environment constraints. To address the lack of training data, a data collection pipeline using Project Aria glasses is presented, resulting in the creation of the Aria Navigation Dataset (AND) containing 4 hours of real-world navigation recordings. The dataset captures diverse navigation scenarios and behaviors, serving as a valuable resource for learning egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's ability to learn human-like navigation behaviors and generalize to unseen environments. More information about the project can be found on the project webpage at https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/lookout.

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4 hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing down, rerouting, and looking around for traffic while generalizing to unseen environments.

<div> Keywords: Vivid-VR, generative video restoration, T2V foundation model, control architecture, texture realism

Summary: 
Vivid-VR is a new method for generative video restoration that leverages a T2V foundation model and ControlNet for content consistency. To address distribution drift and improve texture realism and temporal coherence, a concept distillation training strategy is proposed. This strategy uses a pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual concepts. The control architecture is redesigned with a control feature projector and a new ControlNet connector for enhanced generation controllability. The ControlNet connector combines MLP-based feature mapping with a cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control feature retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid-VR outperforms existing approaches on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness, and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints for Vivid-VR are available on GitHub at https://github.com/csbhr/Vivid-VR.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge, we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness, and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/csbhr/Vivid-VR.

Summary:
SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for Unified Rendering Networks) introduces a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that translates a scene graph into a token sequence for improved interpretation of graph structure. By fine-tuning only the VAR transformer, SATURN significantly reduces FID and increases the Inception Score on the Visual Genome dataset, outperforming prior methods like SG2IM and SGDiff. The approach combines structural awareness with autoregressive fidelity, enhancing object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy without additional modules or multi-stage training. <div>
arXiv:2508.14502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from 56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78, outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art autoregressive fidelity.

Summary: 
The paper introduces PB-IAD, a novel framework utilizing foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. It addresses data sparsity, adaptability, and user-centricity in dynamic production environments. PB-IAD incorporates a prompt template for domain-specific knowledge implementation and a pre-processing module for user inputs translation. This user-friendly approach enables domain experts to customize the system without data science expertise. Evaluation using GPT-4.1 across various manufacturing scenarios and data modalities shows superior performance, especially in data-sparse and low-shot settings, solely through semantic instructions. PB-IAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods like PatchCore in detecting anomalies in manufacturing processes. Overall, the framework demonstrates the potential of leveraging foundation models for efficient and effective anomaly detection in industrial settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions. Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions. Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance, particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely through semantic instructions.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new framework called ScenGE, aimed at generating diverse and challenging safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicles in simulation environments. ScenGE utilizes a Meta-Scenario Generation step to infer adversarial agents and then specifies these scenarios in executable code. The framework also incorporates Complex Scenario Evolution to amplify threats by manipulating background vehicles to create critical occlusions. Experimental results demonstrate that ScenGE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in uncovering severe collision cases. Furthermore, applying adversarial training on ScenGE-generated scenarios enhances the robustness of autonomous vehicle models. Real-world vehicle tests and human evaluations validate the plausibility and critical nature of the generated scenarios, emphasizing the importance of such frameworks in building trust and ensuring safe deployment of autonomous vehicles. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows. Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently, Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

Summary: 
The article introduces WISE-FUSE, a novel framework for adaptive Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) encoding in computational pathology. WSI processing poses a significant computational challenge due to its gigapixel scale, resulting in long processing times and high costs. WISE-FUSE addresses this bottleneck by selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions, utilizing similarity scores and knowledge distillation mechanisms. This framework quickly eliminates irrelevant patches at a coarse level and selectively encodes high-resolution patches fused with textual embeddings to enhance diagnostic context. Through extensive experiments, WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while maintaining or surpassing diagnostic performance compared to exhaustive patch processing. It offers a scalable and practical solution for computational pathology applications. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

Summary:
This article presents a new unsupervised method for improving OCR performance on low-quality printed documents by leveraging the redundancy of character shapes within each document. By utilizing an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with an EM algorithm, intra-cluster realignment, and statistical testing, the proposed approach corrects imperfect OCR outputs and enhances clustering. The method shows promising results in various degraded document datasets, including Uruguayan military archives and European newspapers spanning several centuries. This novel approach addresses the limitations of current OCR systems, particularly in scenarios with high inter-domain data variability. <div>
arXiv:2508.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

Abstract: Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel and Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis, including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1) traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest, decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and tendency.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation (CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance (FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510. Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

Summary:
The article introduces Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM) as a framework to enhance the performance of label-free concept bottleneck models. These models rely on foundation models to determine concepts in images but often struggle with accurate localization. LCBM addresses this issue by using prototypes to represent prototypical image features of concepts, optimizing their learning to encode similar local regions. The prototypes help in identifying the relevant local regions for predicting concepts, improving concept localization in images. Experimental results show that LCBM effectively identifies and localizes concepts while maintaining classification performance. This approach enhances the interpretability of concept bottleneck models and provides a more accurate understanding of visual cues in images. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework, coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called GOGS for inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery. GOGS addresses the limitations of existing methods by using 2D Gaussian surfels in a two-stage process. In the first stage, robust surface reconstruction is achieved through physics-based rendering with split-sum approximation and geometric priors. The second stage involves material decomposition using Monte Carlo importance sampling and differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing to capture indirect illumination and refine specular details. The framework outperforms existing approaches in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic relighting under novel illuminations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GOGS in achieving high-fidelity reconstructions with plausible relighting results. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties, leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models. Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering approaches.

It contains ten sequences of vehicle crashes at high-speed driving with 294,924 labeled 2D and 93,012 labeled 3D boxes and track IDs within 48,144 labeled frames recorded from four roadside cameras and LiDARs at 10 Hz. The dataset contains ten object classes and is provided in the OpenLABEL format. We propose Accid3nD, an accident detection model that combines a rule-based approach with a learning-based one. Experiments and ablation studies on our dataset show the robustness of our proposed method. The dataset, model, and code are available on our project website: https://tum-traffic-dataset.github.io/tumtraf-a.

<div> Keywords: Whole slide image analysis, Digital pathology, Multiple Instance Learning, Image augmentation, HistAug

Summary:
HistAug introduces a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations, HistAug can generate realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. This method allows for the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass effectively, leading to improved performance of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models. Experiments across various slide-level tasks and organs demonstrate HistAug's superiority over existing methods, especially in low-data scenarios. Ablation studies reinforce the benefits of learned transformations and emphasize the significance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. The code for HistAug is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

Summary: 
An information-fusion framework is proposed for robust and reliable smoke detection in early fire warning systems. The framework integrates smoke feature representations extracted from monocular imagery using a Two-Phase Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer. A novel smoke segmentation dataset is constructed via optical flow-based motion encoding to address the challenges of smoke plumes' complex spatiotemporal dynamics. A dual-phase level-set fractional-order variational model is utilized for optical flow estimation to capture motion discontinuities. The color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues using a Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke regions. The Shifted-Windows Transformer is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head and trained under a two-phase learning regimen to optimize smoke detection accuracy and estimate plausibility confidence in predictions by jointly modeling uncertainties. Extensive experiments validate the framework's superior generalization and robustness, making it a reliable solution for early fire detection in various applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure, necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and autonomous monitoring applications.

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based IL in IOD.

<title>UST-SSM: Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Models for Point Cloud Video Modeling</title>

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/wangzy01/UST-SSM.

<title>SMTrack: End-to-End Trained Spiking Neural Networks for Multi-Object Tracking in RGB Videos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss (Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and temporal stability.

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps (DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

<title>GeMS: Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Extreme Motion Blur</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14682</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and (3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results, inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this, we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events: (4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from severely blurred inputs.

<title>Seeing Further on the Shoulders of Giants: Knowledge Inheritance for Vision Foundation Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14707</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module. By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data. Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation.

<title>GSFix3D: Diffusion-Guided Repair of Novel Views in Gaussian Splatting</title>

arXiv:2508.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile, diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available. Project page: https://gsfix3d.github.io.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical robotics.

<title>Improved Mapping Between Illuminations and Sensors for RAW Images</title>

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras, and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of training a neural ISP. Link to project page: https://github.com/SamsungLabs/illum-sensor-mapping.

<title>Fusing Monocular RGB Images with AIS Data to Create a 6D Pose Estimation Dataset for Marine Vessels</title>

arXiv:2508.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods (homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation. Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for ship detection from the same scene.

arXiv:2508.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range, that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features, posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement, crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework, MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR (RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments, MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms significantly contribute to these improvements.

arXiv:2508.14809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks, the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general solution for clinical registration without additional training.

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing. Project webpage: https://aim-uofa.github.io/Tinker

<title>Repeating Words for Video-Language Retrieval with Coarse-to-Fine Objectives</title>

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs, including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

<title>TransLight: Image-Guided Customized Lighting Control with Generative Decoupling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14814</link>

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets, injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal. The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination harmonization and editing.

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce. To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning, eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and addresses the lack of labeled events.

<title>Lifespan Pancreas Morphology for Control vs Type 2 Diabetes using AI on Largescale Clinical Imaging</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14878</link>

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution, segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends. Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2 diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13 morphological features were significantly different between patients with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and 675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a clinical setting.

<title>MS-CLR: Multi-Skeleton Contrastive Learning for Human Action Recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14889</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention, which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme. Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance, setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

<title>GaussianArt: Unified Modeling of Geometry and Motion for Articulated Objects</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14891</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization. To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots, and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these, Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world environments.

Abstract: Visual Storytelling is a challenging multimodal task between Vision & Language, where the purpose is to generate a story for a stream of images. Its difficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image sequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance between these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image Captioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant studies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for obtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are transformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our multifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling under a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced stories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach accelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and reproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named ideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle model, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.

<title>Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection for Electroencephalogram: A Task-Independent Approach</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive, low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97% improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse EEG-based applications.

Abstract: Live cell culture is crucial in biomedical studies for analyzing cell properties and dynamics in vitro. This study focuses on segmenting unstained live cells imaged with bright-field microscopy. While many segmentation approaches exist for microscopic images, none consistently address the challenges of bright-field live-cell imaging with high throughput, where temporal phenotype changes, low contrast, noise, and motion-induced blur from cellular movement remain major obstacles. We developed a low-cost CNN-based pipeline incorporating comparative analysis of frozen encoders within a unified U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, instance-aware systems, adaptive loss functions, hard instance retraining, dynamic learning rates, progressive mechanisms to mitigate overfitting, and an ensemble technique. The model was validated on a public dataset featuring diverse live cell variants, showing consistent competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods, achieving 93% test accuracy and an average F1-score of 89% (std. 0.07) on low-contrast, noisy, and blurry images. Notably, the model was trained primarily on bright-field images with limited exposure to phase-contrast microscopy (<10%), yet it generalized effectively to the phase-contrast LIVECell dataset, demonstrating modality, robustness and strong performance. This highlights its potential for real-world laboratory deployment across imaging conditions. The model requires minimal compute power and is adaptable using basic deep learning setups such as Google Colab, making it practical for training on other cell variants. Our pipeline outperforms existing methods in robustness and precision for bright-field microscopy segmentation. The code and dataset are available for reproducibility

Abstract: Computer methods in medical devices are frequently imperfect and are known to produce errors in clinical or diagnostic tasks. However, when deep learning and data-based approaches yield output that exhibit errors, the devices are frequently said to hallucinate. Drawing from theoretical developments and empirical studies in multiple medical device areas, we introduce a practical and universal definition that denotes hallucinations as a type of error that is plausible and can be either impactful or benign to the task at hand. The definition aims at facilitating the evaluation of medical devices that suffer from hallucinations across product areas. Using examples from imaging and non-imaging applications, we explore how the proposed definition relates to evaluation methodologies and discuss existing approaches for minimizing the prevalence of hallucinations.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained immense interest for their generative capabilities, specifically the high quality and diversity of the synthesized data. However, examples of their applications in 3D medical imaging are still scarce, especially in cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac anatomies is crucial for applications such as in silico trials, electromechanical computer simulations, or data augmentations for machine learning models. In this work, we investigate the application of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. To this end, we propose a novel LDM architecture -- MeshLDM. We apply the proposed model on a dataset of 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate its performance in terms of both qualitative and quantitative clinical and 3D mesh reconstruction metrics. The proposed MeshLDM successfully captures characteristics of the cardiac shapes at end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction) cardiac phases, generating meshes with a 2.4% difference in population mean compared to the gold standard.

<title>Fracture Detection and Localisation in Wrist and Hand Radiographs using Detection Transformer Variants</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14129</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Accurate diagnosis of wrist and hand fractures using radiographs is essential in emergency care, but manual interpretation is slow and prone to errors. Transformer-based models show promise in improving medical image analysis, but their application to extremity fractures is limited. This study addresses this gap by applying object detection transformers to wrist and hand X-rays.
  Methods: We fine-tuned the RT-DETR and Co-DETR models, pre-trained on COCO, using over 26,000 annotated X-rays from a proprietary clinical dataset. Each image was labeled for fracture presence with bounding boxes. A ResNet-50 classifier was trained on cropped regions to refine abnormality classification. Supervised contrastive learning was used to enhance embedding quality. Performance was evaluated using AP@50, precision, and recall metrics, with additional testing on real-world X-rays.
  Results: RT-DETR showed moderate results (AP@50 = 0.39), while Co-DETR outperformed it with an AP@50 of 0.615 and faster convergence. The integrated pipeline achieved 83.1% accuracy, 85.1% precision, and 96.4% recall on real-world X-rays, demonstrating strong generalization across 13 fracture types. Visual inspection confirmed accurate localization.
  Conclusion: Our Co-DETR-based pipeline demonstrated high accuracy and clinical relevance in wrist and hand fracture detection, offering reliable localization and differentiation of fracture types. It is scalable, efficient, and suitable for real-time deployment in hospital workflows, improving diagnostic speed and reliability in musculoskeletal radiology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a deep learning-based automated segmentation method for hepatic anatomy (i.e., parenchyma, tumors, portal vein, hepatic vein and biliary tree) from the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. This method should ease the clinical workflow of preoperative planning.
  Methods: Manual segmentation was performed on hepatobiliary phase MRI scans from 90 consecutive patients who underwent liver surgery between January 2020 and October 2023. A deep learning network (nnU-Net v1) was trained on 72 patients with an extra focus on thin structures and topography preservation. Performance was evaluated on an 18-patient test set by comparing automated and manual segmentations using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Following clinical integration, 10 segmentations (assessment dataset) were generated using the network and manually refined for clinical use to quantify required adjustments using DSC.
  Results: In the test set, DSCs were 0.97+/-0.01 for liver parenchyma, 0.80+/-0.04 for hepatic vein, 0.79+/-0.07 for biliary tree, 0.77+/-0.17 for tumors, and 0.74+/-0.06 for portal vein. Average tumor detection rate was 76.6+/-24.1%, with a median of one false-positive per patient. The assessment dataset showed minor adjustments were required for clinical use of the 3D models, with high DSCs for parenchyma (1.00+/-0.00), portal vein (0.98+/-0.01) and hepatic vein (0.95+/-0.07). Tumor segmentation exhibited greater variability (DSC 0.80+/-0.27). During prospective clinical use, the model detected three additional tumors initially missed by radiologists.
  Conclusions: The proposed nnU-Net-based segmentation method enables accurate and automated delineation of hepatic anatomy. This enables 3D planning to be applied efficiently as a standard-of-care for every patient undergoing liver surgery.

<title>STAS: Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Computation Time for Spiking Transformers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an essential diagnostic tool for assessing knee injuries. However, manual interpretation of MRI slices remains time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. This study presents a systematic evaluation of various deep learning architectures combined with explainable AI (xAI) techniques for automated region of interest (ROI) detection in knee MRI scans. We investigate both supervised and self-supervised approaches, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformers (ViT), and multiple U-Net variants augmented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers. To enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, we integrate xAI methods such as Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps. Model performance is assessed using AUC for classification and PSNR/SSIM for reconstruction quality, along with qualitative ROI visualizations. Our results demonstrate that ResNet50 consistently excels in classification and ROI identification, outperforming transformer-based models under the constraints of the MRNet dataset. While hybrid U-Net + MLP approaches show potential for leveraging spatial features in reconstruction and interpretability, their classification performance remains lower. Grad-CAM consistently provided the most clinically meaningful explanations across architectures. Overall, CNN-based transfer learning emerges as the most effective approach for this dataset, while future work with larger-scale pretraining may better unlock the potential of transformer models.

Abstract: With the reduced hardware costs of omnidirectional cameras and the proliferation of various extended reality applications, more and more $360^\circ$ videos are being captured. To fully unleash their potential, advanced video analytics is expected to extract actionable insights and situational knowledge without blind spots from the videos. In this paper, we present OmniSense, a novel edge-assisted framework for online immersive video analytics. OmniSense achieves both low latency and high accuracy, combating the significant computation and network resource challenges of analyzing $360^\circ$ videos. Motivated by our measurement insights into $360^\circ$ videos, OmniSense introduces a lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI) prediction algorithm to prune redundant information in $360^\circ$ frames. Incorporating the video content and network dynamics, it then smartly scales vision models to analyze the predicted SRoIs with optimized resource utilization. We implement a prototype of OmniSense with commodity devices and evaluate it on diverse real-world collected $360^\circ$ videos. Extensive evaluation results show that compared to resource-agnostic baselines, it improves the accuracy by $19.8\%$ -- $114.6\%$ with similar end-to-end latencies. Meanwhile, it hits $2.0\times$ -- $2.4\times$ speedups while keeping the accuracy on par with the highest accuracy of baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.

Abstract: Deep learning-based reconstruction of positron emission tomography(PET) data has gained increasing attention in recent years. While these methods achieve fast reconstruction,concerns remain regarding quantitative accuracy and the presence of artifacts,stemming from limited model interpretability,data driven dependence, and overfitting risks.These challenges have hindered clinical adoption.To address them,we propose a conditional diffusion model with posterior physical correction (PET-DPC) for PET image reconstruction. An innovative normalization procedure generates the input Geometric TOF Probabilistic Image (GTP-image),while physical information is incorporated during the diffusion sampling process to perform posterior scatter,attenuation,and random corrections. The model was trained and validated on 300 brain and 50 whole-body PET datasets,a physical phantom,and 20 simulated brain datasets. PET-DPC produced reconstructions closely aligned with fully corrected OSEM images,outperforming end-to-end deep learning models in quantitative metrics and,in some cases, surpassing traditional iterative methods. The model also generalized well to out-of-distribution(OOD) data. Compared to iterative methods,PET-DPC reduced reconstruction time by 50% for brain scans and 85% for whole-body scans. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of posterior correction in implementing scatter and attenuation corrections,enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experiments with physical phantoms further demonstrated PET-DPC's ability to preserve background uniformity and accurately reproduce tumor-to-background intensity ratios. Overall,these results highlight PET-DPC as a promising approach for rapid, quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction,with strong potential to improve clinical imaging workflows.

Abstract: Inverse rendering aims to reconstruct geometry and reflectance from captured images. Display-camera imaging systems offer unique advantages for this task: each pixel can easily function as a programmable point light source, and the polarized light emitted by LCD displays facilitates diffuse-specular separation. Despite these benefits, there is currently no public real-world dataset captured using display-camera systems, unlike other setups such as light stages. This absence hinders the development and evaluation of display-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we construct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo polarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse geometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We also provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the synthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different noise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing photometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet effective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods. Code and dataset are available on our project page at https://michaelcsj.github.io/DIR/

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models. We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on two different datasets.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and model weights have been released in https://pxf0429.github.io/FGResQ/

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-precision semantic segmentation method based on an improved TransUNet architecture to address the challenges of complex lesion structures, blurred boundaries, and significant scale variations in skin lesion images. The method integrates a transformer module into the traditional encoder-decoder framework to model global semantic information, while retaining a convolutional branch to preserve local texture and edge features. This enhances the model's ability to perceive fine-grained structures. A boundary-guided attention mechanism and multi-scale upsampling path are also designed to improve lesion boundary localization and segmentation consistency. To verify the effectiveness of the approach, a series of experiments were conducted, including comparative studies, hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, data augmentation effects, input resolution variation, and training data split ratio tests. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing representative methods in mIoU, mDice, and mAcc, demonstrating stronger lesion recognition accuracy and robustness. In particular, the model achieves better boundary reconstruction and structural recovery in complex scenarios, making it well-suited for the key demands of automated segmentation tasks in skin lesion analysis.

Abstract: Volumetric ultrasound has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making, yet its widespread adoption remains limited by dependence on specialized hardware and restrictive acquisition protocols. In this work, we present a novel unsupervised framework for reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from freehand 2D transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) sweeps, without requiring external tracking or learned pose estimators. Our method adapts the principles of Gaussian Splatting to the domain of ultrasound, introducing a slice-aware, differentiable rasterizer tailored to the unique physics and geometry of ultrasound imaging. We model anatomy as a collection of anisotropic 3D Gaussians and optimize their parameters directly from image-level supervision, leveraging sensorless probe motion estimation and domain-specific geometric priors. The result is a compact, flexible, and memory-efficient volumetric representation that captures anatomical detail with high spatial fidelity. This work demonstrates that accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D ultrasound images can be achieved through purely computational means, offering a scalable alternative to conventional 3D systems and enabling new opportunities for AI-assisted analysis and diagnosis.

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization. However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex. These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data points and outperforms strong baselines.

<title>Virtual Multiplex Staining for Histological Images using a Marker-wise Conditioned Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large repositories of H&amp;E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling complex data distributions utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate multiplex images from H&amp;E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers. To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches. This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&amp;E and multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale analyses of existing H&amp;E image repositories.

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2) the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking, listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

Abstract: Digital twins offer a powerful framework for subject-specific simulation and clinical decision support, yet their development often hinges on accurate, individualized anatomical modeling. In this work, we present a rule-based approach for subpixel-accurate key-point extraction from MRI, adapted from prior CT-based methods. Our approach incorporates robust image alignment and vertebra-specific orientation estimation to generate anatomically meaningful landmarks that serve as boundary conditions and force application points, like muscle and ligament insertions in biomechanical models. These models enable the simulation of spinal mechanics considering the subject's individual anatomy, and thus support the development of tailored approaches in clinical diagnostics and treatment planning. By leveraging MR imaging, our method is radiation-free and well-suited for large-scale studies and use in underrepresented populations. This work contributes to the digital twin ecosystem by bridging the gap between precise medical image analysis with biomechanical simulation, and aligns with key themes in personalized modeling for healthcare.

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64, mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis - consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets, restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D human bodies from sparse views has been an appealing topic, which is crucial to broader the related applications. In this paper, we propose a quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only two images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier for users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the difficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from the highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on foundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input images have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an enhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information, and then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are directly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain datasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with images captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data collection.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning framework for enhancing 3D perception in autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, our approach, namely NCLR, focuses on 2D-3D neural calibration, a novel pretext task that estimates the rigid pose aligning camera and LiDAR coordinate systems. First, we propose the learnable transformation alignment to bridge the domain gap between image and point cloud data, converting features into a unified representation space for effective comparison and matching. Second, we identify the overlapping area between the image and point cloud with the fused features. Third, we establish dense 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the rigid pose. The framework not only learns fine-grained matching from points to pixels but also achieves alignment of the image and point cloud at a holistic level, understanding the LiDAR-to-camera extrinsic parameters. We demonstrate the efficacy of NCLR by applying the pre-trained backbone to downstream tasks, such as LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation, object detection, and panoptic segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets illustrate the superiority of NCLR over existing self-supervised methods. The results confirm that joint learning from different modalities significantly enhances the network's understanding abilities and effectiveness of learned representation. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Eaphan/NCLR.

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used in image generation because they can generate high-quality and realistic samples. This is in contrast to generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), which have some limitations in terms of image quality.We introduce the diffusion model to the precipitation forecasting task and propose a short-term precipitation nowcasting with condition diffusion model based on historical observational data, which is referred to as SRNDiff. By incorporating an additional conditional decoder module in the denoising process, SRNDiff achieves end-to-end conditional rainfall prediction. SRNDiff is composed of two networks: a denoising network and a conditional Encoder network. The conditional network is composed of multiple independent UNet networks. These networks extract conditional feature maps at different resolutions, providing accurate conditional information that guides the diffusion model for conditional generation.SRNDiff surpasses GANs in terms of prediction accuracy, although it requires more computational resources.The SRNDiff model exhibits higher stability and efficiency during training than GANs-based approaches, and generates high-quality precipitation distribution samples that better reflect future actual precipitation conditions. This fully validates the advantages and potential of diffusion models in precipitation forecasting, providing new insights for enhancing rainfall prediction.

Abstract: Given 2D point correspondences between an image pair, inferring the camera motion is a fundamental issue in the computer vision community. The existing works generally set out from the epipolar constraint and estimate the essential matrix, which is not optimal in the maximum likelihood (ML) sense. In this paper, we dive into the original measurement model with respect to the rotation matrix and normalized translation vector and formulate the ML problem. We then propose a two-step algorithm to solve it: In the first step, we estimate the variance of measurement noises and devise a consistent estimator based on bias elimination; In the second step, we execute a one-step Gauss-Newton iteration on manifold to refine the consistent estimate. We prove that the proposed estimate owns the same asymptotic statistical properties as the ML estimate: The first is consistency, i.e., the estimate converges to the ground truth as the point number increases; The second is asymptotic efficiency, i.e., the mean squared error of the estimate converges to the theoretical lower bound -- Cramer-Rao bound. In addition, we show that our algorithm has linear time complexity. These appealing characteristics endow our estimator with a great advantage in the case of dense point correspondences. Experiments on both synthetic data and real images demonstrate that when the point number reaches the order of hundreds, our estimator outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of estimation accuracy and CPU time.

Abstract: Deepfakes have recently raised significant trust issues and security concerns among the public. Compared to CNN face forgery detectors, ViT-based methods take advantage of the expressivity of transformers, achieving superior detection performance. However, these approaches still exhibit the following limitations: (1) Fully fine-tuning ViT-based models from ImageNet weights demands substantial computational and storage resources; (2) ViT-based methods struggle to capture local forgery clues, leading to model bias; (3) These methods limit their scope on only one or few face forgery features, resulting in limited generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this work introduces Mixture-of-Experts modules for Face Forgery Detection (MoE-FFD), a generalized yet parameter-efficient ViT-based approach. MoE-FFD only updates lightweight Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Adapter layers while keeping the ViT backbone frozen, thereby achieving parameter-efficient training. Moreover, MoE-FFD leverages the expressivity of transformers and local priors of CNNs to simultaneously extract global and local forgery clues. Additionally, novel MoE modules are designed to scale the model's capacity and smartly select optimal forgery experts, further enhancing forgery detection performance. Our proposed learning scheme can be seamlessly adapted to various transformer backbones in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art face forgery detection performance with significantly reduced parameter overhead.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal information-theoretic framework for image captioning, conceptualizing captions as compressed linguistic representations that selectively encode semantic units in images. Our framework posits that good image captions should balance three key aspects: informationally sufficient, minimally redundant, and readily comprehensible by humans. By formulating these aspects as quantitative measures with adjustable weights, our framework provides a flexible foundation for analyzing and optimizing image captioning systems across diverse task requirements. To demonstrate its applicability, we introduce the Pyramid of Captions (PoCa) method, which generates enriched captions by integrating local and global visual information. We present both theoretical proof that PoCa improves caption quality under certain assumptions, and empirical validation of its effectiveness across various image captioning models and datasets.

Abstract: Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and most existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in generating images that closely correspond to textual prompts. However, the advancement of T2I diffusion models presents significant risks, as the models could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as generating images with violence or nudity, or creating unauthorized portraits of public figures in inappropriate contexts. To mitigate these risks, concept removal methods have been proposed. These methods aim to modify diffusion models to prevent the generation of malicious and unwanted concepts. Despite these efforts, existing research faces several challenges: (1) a lack of consistent comparisons on a comprehensive dataset, (2) ineffective prompts in harmful and nudity concepts, (3) overlooked evaluation of the ability to generate the benign part within prompts containing malicious concepts. To address these gaps, we propose to benchmark the concept removal methods by introducing a new dataset, Six-CD, along with a novel evaluation metric. In this benchmark, we conduct a thorough evaluation of concept removals, with the experimental observations and discussions offering valuable insights in the field.

<title>MMAD: Multi-label Micro-Action Detection in Videos</title>

Abstract: Human body actions are an important form of non-verbal communication in social interactions. This paper specifically focuses on a subset of body actions known as micro-actions, which are subtle, low-intensity body movements with promising applications in human emotion analysis. In real-world scenarios, human micro-actions often temporally co-occur, with multiple micro-actions overlapping in time, such as concurrent head and hand movements. However, current research primarily focuses on recognizing individual micro-actions while overlooking their co-occurring nature. To address this gap, we propose a new task named Multi-label Micro-Action Detection (MMAD), which involves identifying all micro-actions in a given short video, determining their start and end times, and categorizing them. Accomplishing this requires a model capable of accurately capturing both long-term and short-term action relationships to detect multiple overlapping micro-actions. To facilitate the MMAD task, we introduce a new dataset named Multi-label Micro-Action-52 (MMA-52) and propose a baseline method equipped with a dual-path spatial-temporal adapter to address the challenges of subtle visual change in MMAD. We hope that MMA-52 can stimulate research on micro-action analysis in videos and prompt the development of spatio-temporal modeling in human-centric video understanding. The proposed MMA-52 dataset is available at: https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Micro-Action.

Abstract: This paper presents VisioPhysioENet, a novel multimodal system that leverages visual and physiological signals to detect learner engagement. It employs a two-level approach for extracting both visual and physiological features. For visual feature extraction, Dlib is used to detect facial landmarks, while OpenCV provides additional estimations. The face recognition library, built on Dlib, is used to identify the facial region of interest specifically for physiological signal extraction. Physiological signals are then extracted using the plane-orthogonal-toskin method to assess cardiovascular activity. These features are integrated using advanced machine learning classifiers, enhancing the detection of various levels of engagement. We thoroughly tested VisioPhysioENet on the DAiSEE dataset. It achieved an accuracy of 63.09%. This shows it can better identify different levels of engagement compared to many existing methods. It performed 8.6% better than the only other model that uses both physiological and visual features.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have been demonstrated with undesired generation due to unfiltered large-scale training data, such as sexual images and copyrights, necessitating the erasure of undesired concepts. Most existing methods focus on modifying the generation probabilities conditioned on the texts containing target concepts. However, they fail to guarantee the desired generation of texts unseen in the training phase, especially for the adversarial texts from malicious attacks. In this paper, we analyze the erasure task and point out that existing methods cannot guarantee the minimization of the total probabilities of undesired generation. To tackle this problem, we propose Dark Miner. It entails a recurring three-stage process that comprises mining, verifying, and circumventing. This method greedily mines embeddings with maximum generation probabilities of target concepts and more effectively reduces their generation. In the experiments, we evaluate its performance on the inappropriateness, object, and style concepts. Compared with the previous methods, our method achieves better erasure and defense results, especially under multiple adversarial attacks, while preserving the native generation capability of the models. Our code will be available on GitHub.

<title>Identity Preserving 3D Head Stylization with Multiview Score Distillation</title>

Abstract: 3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

Abstract: Long-duration talking video synthesis faces persistent challenges in simultaneously achieving high video quality, portrait and temporal consistency, and computational efficiency. As video length increases, issues such as visual degradation, loss of identity consistency, temporal incoherence, and error accumulation become increasingly prominent, severely impacting the realism and reliability of generated results. To address these issues, we present LetsTalk, a diffusion transformer framework that incorporates multimodal guidance and a novel memory bank mechanism, explicitly maintaining contextual continuity and enabling robust, high-quality, and efficient long-duration talking video generation. Specifically, LetsTalk introduces a memory bank combined with a noise-regularized training strategy to mitigate error accumulation and sampling artifacts during long video generation. To further enhance efficiency and spatiotemporal consistency, LetsTalk employs a deep compression autoencoder and a spatiotemporal-aware transformer with linear attention for effective multimodal fusion. Furthermore, we systematically analyze three multimodal fusion schemes, adopting deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait features to ensure visual consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to synchronize animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LetsTalk achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic talking videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency with 8 fewer parameters than previous approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces UnZipLoRA, a method for decomposing an image into its constituent subject and style, represented as two distinct LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations). Unlike existing personalization techniques that focus on either subject or style in isolation, or require separate training sets for each, UnZipLoRA disentangles these elements from a single image by training both the LoRAs simultaneously. UnZipLoRA ensures that the resulting LoRAs are compatible, i.e., they can be seamlessly combined using direct addition. UnZipLoRA enables independent manipulation and recontextualization of subject and style, including generating variations of each, applying the extracted style to new subjects, and recombining them to reconstruct the original image or create novel variations. To address the challenge of subject and style entanglement, UnZipLoRA employs a novel prompt separation technique, as well as column and block separation strategies to accurately preserve the characteristics of subject and style, and ensure compatibility between the learned LoRAs. Evaluation with human studies and quantitative metrics demonstrates UnZipLoRA's effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art methods, including DreamBooth-LoRA, Inspiration Tree, and B-LoRA.

Abstract: Cross-modal contrastive distillation has recently been explored for learning effective 3D representations. However, existing methods focus primarily on modality-shared features, neglecting the modality-specific features during the pre-training process, which leads to suboptimal representations. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the limitations of current contrastive methods for 3D representation learning and propose a new framework, namely CMCR, to address these shortcomings. Our approach improves upon traditional methods by better integrating both modality-shared and modality-specific features. Specifically, we introduce masked image modeling and occupancy estimation tasks to guide the network in learning more comprehensive modality-specific features. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal unified codebook that learns an embedding space shared across different modalities. Besides, we introduce geometry-enhanced masked image modeling to further boost 3D representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method mitigates the challenges faced by traditional approaches and consistently outperforms existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/Eaphan/CMCR.

Abstract: Identifying individual animals within large wildlife populations is essential for effective wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts. Recent advancements in computer vision have shown promise in animal re-identification (Animal ReID) by leveraging data from camera traps. However, existing Animal ReID datasets rely exclusively on visual data, overlooking environmental metadata that ecologists have identified as highly correlated with animal behavior and identity, such as temperature and circadian rhythms. Moreover, the emergence of multimodal models capable of jointly processing visual and textual data presents new opportunities for Animal ReID, but existing datasets fail to leverage these models' text-processing capabilities, limiting their full potential. Additionally, to facilitate the use of metadata in existing ReID methods, we propose the Meta-Feature Adapter (MFA), a lightweight module that can be incorporated into existing vision-language model (VLM)-based Animal ReID methods, allowing ReID models to leverage both environmental metadata and visual information to improve ReID performance. Experiments on MetaWild show that combining baseline ReID models with MFA to incorporate metadata consistently improves performance compared to using visual information alone, validating the effectiveness of incorporating metadata in re-identification. We hope that our proposed dataset can inspire further exploration of multimodal approaches for Animal ReID.

Abstract: High-fidelity text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but their widespread use raises significant ethical concerns, including intellectual property protection and the misuse of synthetic media. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-stage watermarking framework for diffusion models, designed to establish copyright and trace generated images back to their source. Our multi-stage watermarking technique involves embedding: (i) a fixed watermark that is localized in the diffusion model's learned noise distribution and, (ii) a human-imperceptible, dynamic watermark in generates images, leveraging a fine-tuned decoder. By leveraging the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and cosine similarity, we adapt the watermark's shape and color to the generated content while maintaining robustness. We demonstrate that our method enables reliable source verification through watermark classification, even when the dynamic watermark is adjusted for content-specific variations. Source model verification is enabled through watermark classification. o support further research, we generate a dataset of watermarked images and introduce a methodology to evaluate the statistical impact of watermarking on generated content.Additionally, we rigorously test our framework against various attack scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and minimal impact on image quality. Our work advances the field of AI-generated content security by providing a scalable solution for model ownership verification and misuse prevention.

Abstract: Static LiDAR scanners produce accurate, dense, colored point clouds, but often contain obtrusive artifacts which makes them ill-suited for direct display. We propose an efficient method to render photorealistic images of such scans without any expensive preprocessing or training of a scene-specific model. A naive projection of the point cloud to the output view using 1x1 pixels is fast and retains the available detail, but also results in unintelligible renderings as background points leak in between the foreground pixels. The key insight is that these projections can be transformed into a realistic result using a deep convolutional model in the form of a U-Net, and a depth-based heuristic that prefilters the data. The U-Net also handles LiDAR-specific problems such as missing parts due to occlusion, color inconsistencies and varying point densities. We also describe a method to generate synthetic training data to deal with imperfectly-aligned ground truth images. Our method achieves real-time rendering rates using an off-the-shelf GPU and outperforms the state-of-the-art in both speed and quality.

Abstract: We introduce DuCos, a novel depth super-resolution framework grounded in Lagrangian duality theory, offering a flexible integration of multiple constraints and reconstruction objectives to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our DuCos is the first to significantly improve generalization across diverse scenarios with foundation models as prompts. The prompt design consists of two key components: Correlative Fusion (CF) and Gradient Regulation (GR). CF facilitates precise geometric alignment and effective fusion between prompt and depth features, while GR refines depth predictions by enforcing consistency with sharp-edged depth maps derived from foundation models. Crucially, these prompts are seamlessly embedded into the Lagrangian constraint term, forming a synergistic and principled framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DuCos outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

Abstract: Accurate depth and camera pose estimation is essential for achieving high-quality 3D visualisations in robotic-assisted surgery. Despite recent advancements in foundation model adaptation to monocular depth estimation of endoscopic scenes via self-supervised learning (SSL), no prior work has explored their use for pose estimation. These methods rely on low rank-based adaptation approaches, which constrain model updates to a low-rank space. We propose Endo-FASt3r, the first monocular SSL depth and pose estimation framework that uses foundation models for both tasks. We extend the Reloc3r relative pose estimation foundation model by designing Reloc3rX, introducing modifications necessary for convergence in SSL. We also present DoMoRA, a novel adaptation technique that enables higher-rank updates and faster convergence. Experiments on the SCARED dataset show that Endo-FASt3r achieves a substantial $10\%$ improvement in pose estimation and a $2\%$ improvement in depth estimation over prior work. Similar performance gains on the Hamlyn and StereoMIS datasets reinforce the generalisability of Endo-FASt3r across different datasets.

Abstract: Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and temporally coherent. To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored to individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as SOTA VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive human annotations to ensure evaluation alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-view collaborative matching strategy for reliable track construction in complex scenarios. We observe that the pairwise matching paradigms applied to image set matching often result in ambiguous estimation when the selected independent pairs exhibit significant occlusions or extreme viewpoint changes. This challenge primarily stems from the inherent uncertainty in interpreting intricate 3D structures based on limited two-view observations, as the 3D-to-2D projection leads to significant information loss. To address this, we introduce CoMatcher, a deep multi-view matcher to (i) leverage complementary context cues from different views to form a holistic 3D scene understanding and (ii) utilize cross-view projection consistency to infer a reliable global solution. Building on CoMatcher, we develop a groupwise framework that fully exploits cross-view relationships for large-scale matching tasks. Extensive experiments on various complex scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over the mainstream two-view matching paradigm.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success, recent reconstruction-based anomaly detection (AD) methods via diffusion modeling still involve fine-grained noise-strength tuning and computationally expensive multi-step denoising, leading to a fundamental tension between fidelity and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel inversion-based AD approach - detection via noising in latent space - which circumvents explicit reconstruction. Importantly, we contend that the limitations in prior reconstruction-based methods originate from the prevailing detection via denoising in RGB space paradigm. To address this, we model AD under a reconstruction-free formulation, which directly infers the final latent variable corresponding to the input image via DDIM inversion, and then measures the deviation based on the known prior distribution for anomaly scoring. Specifically, in approximating the original probability flow ODE using the Euler method, we only enforce very few inversion steps to noise the clean image to pursue inference efficiency. As the added noise is adaptively derived with the learned diffusion model, the original features for the clean testing image can still be leveraged to yield high detection accuracy. We perform extensive experiments and detailed analysis across three widely used image AD datasets under the unsupervised unified setting to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, regarding state-of-the-art AD performance, and about 2 times inference time speedup without diffusion distillation.

Abstract: Capsule endoscopy is a method to capture images of the gastrointestinal tract and screen for diseases which might remain hidden if investigated with standard endoscopes. Due to the limited size of a video capsule, embedding AI models directly into the capsule demands careful consideration of the model size and thus complicates anomaly detection in this field. Furthermore, the scarcity of available data in this domain poses an ongoing challenge to achieving effective anomaly detection. Thus, this work introduces an ensemble strategy to address this challenge in anomaly detection tasks in video capsule endoscopies, requiring only a small number of individual neural networks during both the training and inference phases. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of multiple independently trained neural networks. This has shown to be highly effective in enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models. However, this comes at the cost of higher memory usage and increased computational effort, which quickly becomes prohibitive in many real-world applications. Instead of applying the same training algorithm to each individual network, we propose using various loss functions, drawn from the anomaly detection field, to train each network. The methods are validated on the two largest publicly available datasets for video capsule endoscopy images, the Galar and the Kvasir-Capsule dataset. We achieve an AUC score of 76.86% on the Kvasir-Capsule and an AUC score of 76.98% on the Galar dataset. Our approach outperforms current baselines with significantly fewer parameters across all models, which is a crucial step towards incorporating artificial intelligence into capsule endoscopies.

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2, and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings, while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly, while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality, yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how multimodal meaning is constructed.

Abstract: The preservation of early visual arts, particularly color photographs, is challenged by deterioration caused by aging and improper storage, leading to issues like blurring, scratches, color bleeding, and fading defects. Despite great advances in image restoration and enhancement in recent years, such systematic defects often cannot be restored by current state-of-the-art software features as available e.g. in Adobe Photoshop, but would require the incorporation of defect-aware priors into the underlying machine learning techniques. However, there are no publicly available datasets of autochromes with defect annotations. In this paper, we address these limitations and present the first approach that allows the automatic removal of greening color defects in digitized autochrome photographs. For this purpose, we introduce an approach for accurately simulating respective defects and use the respectively obtained synthesized data with its ground truth defect annotations to train a generative AI model with a carefully designed loss function that accounts for color imbalances between defected and non-defected areas. As demonstrated in our evaluation, our approach allows for the efficient and effective restoration of the considered defects, thereby overcoming limitations of alternative techniques that struggle with accurately reproducing original colors and may require significant manual effort.

Abstract: We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways. First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens, we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

Abstract: Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle: (1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset, offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in complex driving environments.

Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation, facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL) from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

Abstract: Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}: Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline, guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available at https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/RSTrack.

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation by enabling intelligent real-time decision-making, thereby reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a significant advance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves an accuracy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters while surpassing the current baselines.

<title>Bench2ADVLM: A Closed-Loop Benchmark for Vision-language Models in Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience, and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design, heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution. Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop conditions.

<title>Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens</title>

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion) parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of tokens for both.

The best performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision. We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the dataset with different labels.

<title>A Novel Image Similarity Metric for Scene Composition Structure</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc. Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal, neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM), a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely, it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of scene composition.

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet 50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs. FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19) with a 400% compression ratio. Furthermore, our highest compression model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768, outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution (target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution. We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'', or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors.

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6% / +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

Abstract: In this study, a radiomics approach was extended to optical fluorescence molecular imaging data for tissue classification, termed 'optomics'. Fluorescence molecular imaging is emerging for precise surgical guidance during head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) resection. However, the tumor-to-normal tissue contrast is confounded by intrinsic physiological limitations of heterogeneous expression of the target molecule, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Optomics seek to improve tumor identification by probing textural pattern differences in EGFR expression conveyed by fluorescence. A total of 1,472 standardized optomic features were extracted from fluorescence image samples. A supervised machine learning pipeline involving a support vector machine classifier was trained with 25 top-ranked features selected by minimum redundancy maximum relevance criterion. Model predictive performance was compared to fluorescence intensity thresholding method by classifying testing set image patches of resected tissue with histologically confirmed malignancy status. The optomics approach provided consistent improvement in prediction accuracy on all test set samples, irrespective of dose, compared to fluorescence intensity thresholding method (mean accuracies of 89% vs. 81%; P = 0.0072). The improved performance demonstrates that extending the radiomics approach to fluorescence molecular imaging data offers a promising image analysis technique for cancer detection in fluorescence-guided surgery.

Abstract: \hspace{2mm} Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) of the brain offers unique capabilities including noninvasive probing of tissue microstructure and structural connectivity. It is widely used for clinical assessment of disease and injury, and for neuroscience research. Analyzing the dMRI data to extract useful information for medical and scientific purposes can be challenging. The dMRI measurements may suffer from strong noise and artifacts, and may exhibit high inter-session and inter-scanner variability in the data, as well as inter-subject heterogeneity in brain structure. Moreover, the relationship between measurements and the phenomena of interest can be highly complex. Recent years have witnessed increasing use of machine learning methods for dMRI analysis. This manuscript aims to assess these efforts, with a focus on methods that have addressed data preprocessing and harmonization, microstructure mapping, tractography, and white matter tract analysis. We study the main findings, strengths, and weaknesses of the existing methods and suggest topics for future research. We find that machine learning may be exceptionally suited to tackle some of the difficult tasks in dMRI analysis. However, for this to happen, several shortcomings of existing methods and critical unresolved issues need to be addressed. There is a pressing need to improve evaluation practices, to increase the availability of rich training datasets and validation benchmarks, as well as model generalizability, reliability, and explainability concerns.

Abstract: Accurate patient positioning is critical for precise radiotherapy dose delivery, as positioning errors can significantly affect treatment outcomes. This study introduces a novel method for tracking loco-regional tissue deformation through Cherenkov image analysis during fractionated breast cancer radiotherapy. The primary goal was to develop and test an algorithm for Cherenkov-based regional position accuracy quantification, specifically for loco-regional deformations, which lack ideal quantification methods in radiotherapy. Blood vessel detection and segmentation were developed in Cherenkov images using a tissue phantom with incremental movements, and later applied to images from fractionated whole breast radiotherapy in human patients (n=10). A combined rigid and non-rigid registration technique was used to detect inter- and intra-fractional positioning variations. This approach quantified positioning variations in two parts: a global shift from rigid registration and a two-dimensional variation map of loco-regional deformation from non-rigid registration. The methodology was validated using an anthropomorphic chest phantom experiment, where known treatment couch translations and respiratory motion were simulated to assess inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, yielding an average accuracy of 0.83 mm for couch translations up to 20 mm. Analysis of clinical Cherenkov data from ten breast cancer patients showed an inter-fraction setup variation of 3.7 plus minus 2.4 mm relative to the first fraction and loco-regional deformations (95th percentile) of up to 3.3 plus minus 1.9 mm. This study presents a Cherenkov-based approach to quantify global and local positioning variations, demonstrating feasibility in addressing loco-regional deformations that conventional imaging techniques fail to capture.

Abstract: In recent years, a substantial body of work in visually grounded natural language processing has focused on real-life multimodal scenarios such as describing content depicted in images or videos. However, comparatively less attention has been devoted to study the nature and degree of interaction between the different modalities in these scenarios. In this paper, we argue that any task dealing with natural language generation from sequences of images or frames is an instance of the broader, more general problem of modeling the intricate relationships between visual events unfolding over time and the features of the language used to interpret, describe, or narrate them. Therefore, solving these tasks requires models to be capable of identifying and managing such intricacies. We consider five seemingly different tasks, which we argue are compelling instances of this broader multimodal problem. Subsequently, we survey the modeling and evaluation approaches adopted for these tasks in recent years and examine the common set of challenges these tasks pose. Building on this perspective, we identify key open questions and propose several research directions for future investigation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.

Abstract: Despite large-scale pretraining endowing models with language and vision reasoning capabilities, improving their spatial reasoning capability remains challenging due to the lack of data grounded in the 3D world. While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm, which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon, goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.

Summary:
Driver fatigue detection is crucial for preventing road accidents, with vision-based techniques offering a non-intrusive solution. However, challenges like poor object detection and limited feature modeling persist. To address this, YOLO11-CR, a lightweight object detection model, introduces the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM) and Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM). CAFM enhances feature expressiveness by combining local CNN features with global Transformer-based context, while RCM improves spatial localization for profile faces and small objects like mobile phones. YOLO11-CR achieves high precision, recall, and mAP scores on the DSM dataset, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of CAFM and RCM in enhancing sensitivity and localization accuracy. The model shows promise for real-time fatigue detection in vehicles, with potential for future enhancements like temporal modeling and multi-modal data integration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of 55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and embedded optimization.

<div> Benchmark, AI-generated images, detection, Mirage-R1, in-the-wild scenarios

Summary:
The article addresses the challenge of detecting AI-generated images (AIGI) in real-world scenarios, where existing detectors struggle to generalize. The authors introduce Mirage, a benchmark dataset that emulates the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI, sourced from both the internet and synthesized datasets. They propose Mirage-R1, a vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, trained through a two-stage process including supervised-fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Mirage-R1 also utilizes an adaptive thinking strategy at inference time for faster and more accurate detection. Experimental results show that Mirage-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art detectors on both Mirage and public benchmarks. The article emphasizes the importance of addressing the threat of AIGI in ensuring information security and public trust. The benchmark dataset and code will be made publicly available for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust. Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage. By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10% on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial. Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians' ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis, physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information. We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a 10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

<div> Keywords: large vision-language models, Optical Character Recognition, expert models, reasoning-enhanced framework, hallucinations

Summary: 
DianJin-OCR-R1 is a framework designed to improve document image parsing by combining large vision-language models with expert OCR models through a reasoning-enhanced approach. This model addresses the issue of hallucinations in LVLMs by leveraging the specialized capabilities of expert models for OCR tasks. By integrating the results of expert models as references, DianJin-OCR-R1 enhances the accuracy and reliability of OCR recognition. The reasoning process within the framework allows for a comprehensive analysis of the input image content, leading to more accurate recognition outcomes. Experimental evaluation on ReST and OmniDocBench datasets demonstrates the superior performance of DianJin-OCR-R1 compared to non-reasoning LVLMs and expert OCR models. This approach showcases the effectiveness of combining the strengths of large vision-language models with domain-specific expertise to achieve enhanced document image parsing capabilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However, generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images. Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction, our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our method.

Summary: 
Urdu, a cursive script language with complexities in its geometrical and morphological structure, poses challenges for traditional optical character recognition systems. This study proposes an approach using convolutional neural networks (CNN) for component-based classification in Urdu OCR. By training the CNN on a dataset generated through character permutation and employing a hierarchical neural network with two levels, the model achieved a high accuracy of 99% for component classification. The system addresses the context sensitivity of Urdu text through efficient segmentation techniques and automatic feature learning. By applying connected component techniques and discarding unnecessary images, the model focuses on ligatures, improving recognition accuracy. Overall, this innovative approach offers a promising solution for accurate and efficient Urdu optical character recognition.

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of character permutations and component classification Our model successfully achieved 0.99% for component classification.

<div> Keywords: disease severity estimation, ulcerative colitis, endoscopic images, curriculum learning, ordinal classification

Summary: 
CLoE is a curriculum learning framework designed to estimate disease severity from endoscopic images, focusing on grading inflammation in ulcerative colitis using the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES). This framework considers label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the MES score. By implementing a curriculum based on image quality and incorporating ResizeMix augmentation, CLoE aims to improve performance in ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Experiments conducted on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets demonstrate consistent enhancements in performance compared to strong supervised and self-supervised baselines, with ConvNeXt-Tiny achieving 82.5% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC. This highlights the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies in improving disease severity estimation from endoscopic images, offering a promising approach for enhancing clinical assessments in ulcerative colitis. Code for CLoE will be available at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness. Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches 82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

Summary: 
Gait recognition is a biometric task that identifies individuals based on their walking patterns from a distance. GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based framework, generates realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain by training a video diffusion model exclusively on gait silhouette data. The generated sequences are temporally consistent, identity-preserving, and controllable. Synthetic samples from GaitCrafter improve gait recognition performance, especially in challenging conditions. The framework also allows the generation of novel identities by interpolating identity embeddings, maintaining the privacy of real subjects.

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain. Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch, exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions. Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects. Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

<div> Vision-Language Models, Autonomous Driving, Efficient Inference, Token Pruning, Multi-view Images <br />
<br />
Summary: 
Prune2Drive is introduced as a visual token pruning framework for efficient inference in multi-view Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The framework leverages diversity-aware token selection inspired by farthest point sampling to prioritize semantic and spatial coverage across views. Additionally, a view-adaptive pruning controller learns optimal ratios for pruning visual tokens from each camera view based on their importance for driving tasks. Prune2Drive does not require retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible with efficient attention implementations. Experimental results on DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1 benchmarks demonstrate significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining or improving task performance. With only 10% of the original visual tokens retained, Prune2Drive achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes 13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM benchmark. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception, reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras. This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling, which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens, our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes 13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM benchmark.

<div> framework, adversarial examples, Lp-norm, perceptual alignment, meta-attack <br />
Summary: DAASH is a new framework for generating adversarial examples that are both effective and perceptually aligned. It strategically combines existing Lp-based attack methods in a multi-stage process, dynamically adjusting their contributions to minimize misclassification loss and perceptual distortion. DAASH outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks like AdvAD on models across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, achieving higher attack success rates and better visual quality. It also generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical baseline for evaluating robustness without the need for customized attacks for each defense. <div>
arXiv:2508.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion, enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates (e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM, LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively). Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date, encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients, 96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001) occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3% exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age (p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Summary:
Small language models (SLMs) are examined for their efficacy in a medical imaging classification task, specifically differentiating between chest X-ray positions. The study compares various SLMs and prompt designs to determine the optimal combination for accuracy and usability in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Results indicate that certain SLMs can achieve competitive accuracy when paired with well-crafted prompts. This suggests that prompt engineering plays a significant role in enhancing SLM performance in healthcare applications, even without requiring extensive AI expertise from end users.<br /><br />Summary: Small language models are evaluated for their performance in a medical imaging classification task focusing on chest X-ray positions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

<div> Keywords: Easy-Options Bias, Visual Question Answering, VLMs, GroundAttack, NExT-QA

Summary: 
In this study, researchers identify an issue of Easy-Options Bias (EOB) in certain multiple-choice Visual Question Answering benchmarks. This bias allows models to select the correct answer without needing the question, making evaluations inaccurate. Through experiments, they found the bias stems from an imbalance in visual relevance, where the correct answer aligns more closely with visual contents than negative options. To address this bias, the researchers introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that generates hard negative options to create EOB-free annotations. Application of GroundAttack to specific datasets results in more realistic evaluations of VLMs, showing significantly decreased accuracy under certain settings. The release of codes and new annotations is planned to further contribute to improving VQA benchmarks. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar, RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question (Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O) settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings, providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new annotations will be released soon.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework called VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis) that utilizes Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and structured prompting to improve highway scene understanding and traffic risk inference. By combining large models like GPT-4o and o3-mini with a smaller student VLM through knowledge distillation, VISTA produces high-quality traffic scene annotations and risk assessments. Despite its reduced parameter count, VISTA performs well in captioning metrics and demonstrates the effectiveness of knowledge distillation for lightweight VLMs on complex reasoning tasks. The compact architecture enables VISTA to be deployed on edge devices for real-time risk monitoring without the need for extensive infrastructure upgrades.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models (VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

- Enables individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional expression.
- Decomposes facial dynamics into distinct latent spaces for mouth, pose, eye, and expression.

arXiv:2508.13442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge. The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50 baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved 95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50. In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Summary:
MINR is introduced to efficiently encode multiple images using shared intermediate layers and input-specific input and output layers. By analyzing weight distributions of trained INRs, it is found that intermediate layers exhibit similar patterns, leading to the sharing proposal. A unique projection layer is designed for each image to capture its distinct features. Experimental results show MINR can save up to 60% parameters while maintaining performance, even with 100 images. The approach scales effectively, achieving an average PSNR of 34 dB. Various backbone analyses demonstrate the robustness of MINR.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to 60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

DHQ is a distribution-aware Hadamard quantization scheme that targets both weights and activations in Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). This approach standardizes diverse weight and activation distributions using the Hadamard transformation before applying a standard quantizer. Experimental results show that DHQ outperforms previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7%, energy consumption by 40.1%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3% compared to full-precision counterparts. The proposed FPGA implementation of DHQ demonstrates its hardware efficiency in various image reconstruction tasks. DHQ addresses the limitations of previous INR quantization approaches by considering weight and activation quantization simultaneously, leading to improved performance and significant hardware savings.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency. Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision counterparts.

Summary:
Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a continuous manner through neural networks. However, their vulnerability to perturbations poses a challenge for real-world applications. This study explores the robustness of INRs and identifies that minor perturbations can significantly impact signal reconstruction quality. To address this, a robustness problem is formulated, minimizing the difference in loss with and without weight perturbations. A novel robust loss function is derived to enhance robustness by regulating the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights. Experimental results across various modalities demonstrate a notable improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values, with up to a 7.5 dB gain compared to original INRs in noisy conditions. This approach shows promising potential for enhancing the robustness of INRs in multimedia applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights, thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original INRs under noisy conditions.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new method for Micro-expressions recognition (MER) using multi-task learning and hierarchical attention. The approach combines 2D and 3D CNNs, AMNet2D and AMNet3D, with shared backbone network Resnet18 and attention modules. The model, named FAMNet, trains on MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD) simultaneously using different data loading methods for each network. Parameter hard sharing enhances information association. Experimental results show significant performance improvements, with FAMNet achieving 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1) on the SAMM, CASME II, and MMEW datasets, and 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1) on the CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset. The proposed FAMNet method effectively extracts MEs' fine-grained and spatiotemporal features, addressing the challenges posed by the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions. <div>
arXiv:2508.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs) bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs' fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data. Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to existing mainstream approaches.

<div> Keywords: multi-view clustering, representation learning, decoupling, consistency learning, contrastive learning

Summary:<br />
Multi-view clustering aims to find patterns in multi-view data by learning the consistency and complementarity between features. However, the role of cluster-oriented representation learning is often overlooked. This paper presents a novel framework called Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning (BDCL) to enhance inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness in multi-view clustering. The framework consists of three modules: a multi-view instance learning module, a bi-level decoupling module, and a consistency learning module. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that BDCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

<div> Keywords: HDR imaging, reinforcement learning, motion blur, noise simulation, exposure optimization

Summary:
AdaptiveAE is a new method for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging in dynamic environments. It uses reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to improve HDR reconstruction quality. By considering the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO, AdaptiveAE addresses issues such as motion blur and noise in dynamic scenes. It integrates an image synthesis pipeline that includes motion blur and noise simulation during training, utilizing semantic information and exposure histograms. The method can adaptively select optimal shutter speed and ISO sequences within a user-defined exposure time budget, outperforming traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that AdaptiveAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in HDR imaging. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Summary:
This study introduces a novel approach to analyze doubles badminton matches using pose-based shot recognition. By transferring singles-trained models to doubles analysis, the researchers extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet dataset using ViT-Pose and employed a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To enhance tracking stability, a custom multi-object tracking algorithm was implemented to address ID switching issues resulting from fast player movements. A Transformer-based classifier was then utilized to identify shot occurrences based on the learned embeddings. The findings showcase the feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, thereby expanding analytics capabilities in the sport. This work lays the groundwork for the development of doubles-specific datasets to advance understanding of this prevalent yet underexplored format of one of the fastest racket sports in the world. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles, previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format of the fast racket sport.

<div> tokenizer, AR image generation, visual information, geometric structures, Visual Gaussian Quantization 

Summary:
The article introduces Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a new framework for image tokenization in AR image generation. VGQ enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D Gaussians into traditional visual quantization frameworks, capturing geometric and spatial structures. This novel approach addresses limitations of existing tokenizers like VQ-GAN, which focus on texture and color, neglecting geometric details. By encoding image latents as 2D Gaussians, VGQ improves reconstruction fidelity and richness in visual content. Increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in reconstruction quality. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Increasing the density of 2D Gaussians further boosts reconstruction capability, surpassing existing methods with an rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93. Codes for VGQ will be released soon. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Summary:
Geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration addresses the gap between observed training samples and the true distribution in deep learning. Leveraging off-the-shelf foundation models for feature extraction demonstrates transferability of geometric shapes across domains. In the federated learning setting, a technique acquires global geometric shape under privacy constraints to bridge local and global observations. For long-tailed recognition, geometric knowledge from sample-rich categories aids in recovering true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Experimental results show improved performance in overcoming data heterogeneity and sample imbalance challenges with the proposed calibration framework. <div>

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc. In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf (vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs), including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models, particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment. This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a novel framework called EAvatar for high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction in AR/VR and multimedia content creation. The framework is based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and addresses the limitations of existing methods in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity in deformable regions. EAvatar incorporates a sparse expression control mechanism that accurately models local deformations and fine-scale texture transitions. Additionally, the framework leverages 3D priors from pretrained generative models to provide reliable facial geometry, improving convergence stability and shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that EAvatar produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with improved expression controllability and detail fidelity. <div>

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR, gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism, where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

Through the use of DWT and energy scores, frequency information is explicitly guided to the network, resulting in improved accuracy and efficiency in neural representations. This novel approach enhances the capabilities of INRs, demonstrating significant advancements in various vision tasks and showcasing the potential for more efficient and effective signal processing techniques.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems, limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Summary:
In this work, a lightweight Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) framework is proposed to address the challenges of large model parameters and high computational costs. The framework combines architectural redesign and operational refinement through dual-mode optimization. Architecturally, slimmer and more efficient layers replace traditional convolutions to reduce complexity while maintaining feature expressiveness.

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC framework that introduces dual-mode optimization - combining architectural redesign and operational refinement - to reduce complexity whilst preserving reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3 convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9% computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Summary: The article introduces a novel Neuron-like Encoding approach in the field of neuromorphic computing, specifically focusing on improving the performance of spiking neural networks (SNNs). The traditional limitation of SNNs in comparison to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is addressed through the development of a method that generates spike data based on biological neuron functions. By incorporating an artificial photoreceptor layer, the spike data can carry color and luminance information, creating a complete visual spike signal. Experimentation using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron model validates the effectiveness of this biologically inspired approach, enhancing the information content of spike signals and subsequently improving SNN performance. The proposed method aligns with the core principles of neuromorphic computing while offering promising potential for future advancements in the field, potentially overcoming current limitations and expanding the applications of SNNs.

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data. Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader applications of SNNs.

Summary: 
DictAS is a novel framework for detecting visual anomalies in unseen object categories without retraining on the target data. It leverages self-supervised learning to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the few-shot anomaly segmentation task. The framework consists of three key components: the construction of a dictionary using features from normal reference images, the retrieval of queried region features via sparse lookup from the dictionary, and query discrimination regularization to enhance anomaly discrimination. This regularization includes Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint to make abnormal features harder to retrieve. Experimental results on seven public industrial and medical datasets show that DictAS outperforms current state-of-the-art FSAS methods consistently.<br /><br />Summary: DictAS is a framework for few-shot anomaly segmentation that utilizes self-supervised learning to detect anomalies in unseen object categories without retraining.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation (FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes. However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically, DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** - to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

<div> framework, neural, SMPLify, human pose, shape estimation
Summary:
Learnable SMPLify introduces a neural framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a single-pass regression model. The framework addresses challenges in data construction and generalization through a temporal sampling strategy and human-centric normalization scheme. It achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify and generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH datasets. The method supports sequential inference and can be used as a plug-in tool for refining existing image-based estimators in a model-agnostic manner. The code for Learnable SMPLify is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Learnable-SMPLify. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space. Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify, generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Learnable-SMPLify.

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving, which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is available at https://github.com/Generative-Feature-Model/GAF.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel Temporal-Conditional Referring Video Object Segmentation model that focuses on improving the segmentation head design for more accurate boundary segmentation. This model integrates existing segmentation methods and utilizes a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. By eliminating the noise prediction module to prevent degradation of segmentation accuracy, the model is simplified while performance is enhanced. A Temporal Context Mask Refinement (TCMR) module is designed to address the limited feature extraction capability of the VAE, significantly boosting segmentation quality without complex designs.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore, our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement (TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation. The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain, snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based, and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62 percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

<div> Keywords: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, autonomous driving, robotic navigation, FoundationSSC, Axis-Aware Fusion.

Summary:
FoundationSSC introduces a novel approach to camera-based 3D semantic scene completion by dual decoupling at the source and pathway levels. By utilizing a foundation encoder to provide rich semantic features and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes, the model can better handle the conflicting demands of semantic and geometric priors. Decoupled pathways refine these priors, leading to improved semantic context and depth distributions for enhanced performance. A hybrid view transformation generates complementary 3D features using disentangled inputs. The Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module addresses the challenge of anisotropically merging features for unified representation. Extensive experiments show FoundationSSC's superiority, achieving notable advancements in both semantic and geometric metrics on benchmark datasets like SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. This new framework sets a state-of-the-art performance standard in 3D semantic scene completion. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However, existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised, decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions. Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by +0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61 IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and high personalization.

This framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results, thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for future use in the user acceptance test.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language, and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality, and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets, exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for future research.

arXiv:2508.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally, we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Summary:
Diffusion models have shown significant potential in generating high-quality samples and improving performance in various domains through Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the effectiveness of generated samples is highly dependent on the selection of the guidance weight. This study identifies a crucial "training-inference gap" that affects conditional generation performance and makes outputs sensitive to the guidance weight. By quantifying and reducing this gap using the proposed DiffIER method, which optimizes errors during inference through iterative error minimization, the quality of generated samples can be significantly improved. Empirical results across tasks such as text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation confirm the effectiveness and versatility of DiffIER in enhancing generation quality and advancing research in various applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap. Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks. Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

This paper presents OmniTry, a unified framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects, e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e., portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage, the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects, with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at https://omnitry.github.io/.

<div> efficiency, topology fidelity, spatial consistency, graph generation, road network

Summary:
DeH4R is a novel hybrid model designed to address challenges in extracting road networks from remote sensing imagery. It combines efficiency and dynamics by decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex prediction, initial graph construction, and graph expansion. This allows for dynamic vertex and edge insertions while maintaining fast inference speed. The model outperforms the prior state-of-the-art method RNGDet++ on CityScale benchmarks by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU, while also being approximately 10 times faster. DeH4R achieves enhanced topology fidelity and spatial consistency, making it a promising solution for road network extraction in geospatial computer vision tasks. The code for DeH4R will be publicly available on GitHub to facilitate further research and application in this field.

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping. Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

<title>HumanPCR: Probing MLLM Capabilities in Diverse Human-Centric Scenes</title>

arXiv:2508.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C, and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000 human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9 dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise. Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over 30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric application of multimodal models.

<title>Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13712</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently, advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g., yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20% labeled data.

<title>Hierarchical Vision-Language Retrieval of Educational Metaverse Content in Agriculture</title>

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\% MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/aliabdari/Agricultural_Metaverse_Retrieval .

<title>Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However, current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage, without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.

<title>Mitigating Cross-Image Information Leakage in LVLMs for Multi-Image Tasks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13744</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13744</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural modifications.

<title>MR6D: Benchmarking 6D Pose Estimation for Mobile Robots</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators, interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/anas-gouda/mr6d.

arXiv:2508.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to 2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template (SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together, these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

<title>VisionLaw: Inferring Interpretable Intrinsic Dynamics from Visual Observations via Bilevel Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13792</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level, we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel scenarios.

<title>A Fully Transformer Based Multimodal Framework for Explainable Cancer Image Segmentation Using Radiology Reports</title>

arXiv:2508.13796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion. Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps, and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

<title>Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications. This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse (A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable attack success rate.

<title>Unsupervised Urban Tree Biodiversity Mapping from Street-Level Imagery Using Spatially-Aware Visual Clustering</title>

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities, the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity, achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain. Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities -- such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/grimalPaul/gsn-factory.

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of our system compared to the foundational model.

arXiv:2508.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

<title>In-hoc Concept Representations to Regularise Deep Learning in Medical Imaging</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13880</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept supervision.

<title>Forecasting Smog Events Using ConvLSTM: A Spatio-Temporal Approach for Aerosol Index Prediction in South Asia</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13891</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of ~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM), the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress, current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image, enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets, annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments, significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image. By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex illumination conditions.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2) the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

<title>RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image Rotation</title>

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information -- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images, while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets, such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density, creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags, points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets, significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of packages transportation. With rising demands in the logistics sector, the development of automated systems utilizing advanced technologies has become increasingly crucial. Moreover, the widespread use of plastic wrapping has motivated researchers to investigate eco-friendly alternatives that still adhere to safety standards. We present a fully controllable and accurate physical simulation system capable of replicating the behavior of moving pallets. It features a 3D graphics-based virtual environment that supports a wide range of configurations, including variable package layouts, different wrapping materials, and diverse dynamic conditions. This innovative approach reduces the need for physical testing, cutting costs and environmental impact while improving measurement accuracy for analyzing pallet dynamics. Additionally, we train a deep neural network to evaluate the rendered videos generated by our simulator, as a crash-test predictor for pallet configurations, further enhancing the system's utility in safety analysis.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100 km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks, which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of 30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods, reaching distances up to 250 meters.

Abstract: We introduce ResPlan, a large-scale dataset of 17,000 detailed, structurally rich, and realistic residential floor plans, created to advance spatial AI research. Each plan includes precise annotations of architectural elements (walls, doors, windows, balconies) and functional spaces (such as kitchens, bedrooms, and bathrooms). ResPlan addresses key limitations of existing datasets such as RPLAN (Wu et al., 2019) and MSD (van Engelenburg et al., 2024) by offering enhanced visual fidelity and greater structural diversity, reflecting realistic and non-idealized residential layouts. Designed as a versatile, general-purpose resource, ResPlan supports a wide range of applications including robotics, reinforcement learning, generative AI, virtual and augmented reality, simulations, and game development. Plans are provided in both geometric and graph-based formats, enabling direct integration into simulation engines and fast 3D conversion. A key contribution is an open-source pipeline for geometry cleaning, alignment, and annotation refinement. Additionally, ResPlan includes structured representations of room connectivity, supporting graph-based spatial reasoning tasks. Finally, we present comparative analyses with existing benchmarks and outline several open benchmark tasks enabled by ResPlan. Ultimately, ResPlan offers a significant advance in scale, realism, and usability, providing a robust foundation for developing and benchmarking next-generation spatial intelligence systems.

<title>Online 3D Gaussian Splatting Modeling with Novel View Selection</title>

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction. However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage. However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in 3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs, however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA), a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images. Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism, formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs, while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at https://github.com/jsrdcht/Noisy-Alignment.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models. We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches, from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while maintaining efficiency in training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians, resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS, noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles, achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense modification text that is around seven times more than its existing counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder, enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense modification texts.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED) is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77\% successful rate, which is 34.62\%-45.19\% higher than previous works. Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is 62.1\%-69.6\% lower than state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this problem.

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising 224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents' multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question, enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\% accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of native multimodal reasoning in current models.

Abstract: Colon polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This study investigates the application of deep learning-based object detection for early polyp identification using colonoscopy images. We utilize the Kvasir-SEG dataset, applying extensive data augmentation and splitting the data into training (80\%), validation (20\% of training), and testing (20\%) sets. Three variants of the YOLOv5 architecture (YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l) are evaluated. Experimental results show that YOLOv5l outperforms the other variants, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 85.1\%, with the highest average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.86. These findings demonstrate that YOLOv5l provides superior detection performance for colon polyp localization, offering a promising tool for enhancing colorectal cancer screening accuracy.

Abstract: Radiology, radiation oncology, and medical physics require decision-making that integrates medical images, textual reports, and quantitative data under high-stakes conditions. With the introduction of GPT-5, it is critical to assess whether recent advances in large multimodal models translate into measurable gains in these safety-critical domains. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks: (1) VQA-RAD, a benchmark for visual question answering in radiology; (2) SLAKE, a semantically annotated, multilingual VQA dataset testing cross-modal grounding; and (3) a curated Medical Physics Board Examination-style dataset of 150 multiple-choice questions spanning treatment planning, dosimetry, imaging, and quality assurance. Across all datasets, GPT-5 achieved the highest accuracy, with substantial gains over GPT-4o up to +20.00% in challenging anatomical regions such as the chest-mediastinal, +13.60% in lung-focused questions, and +11.44% in brain-tissue interpretation. On the board-style physics questions, GPT-5 attained 90.7% accuracy (136/150), exceeding the estimated human passing threshold, while GPT-4o trailed at 78.0%. These results demonstrate that GPT-5 delivers consistent and often pronounced performance improvements over GPT-4o in both image-grounded reasoning and domain-specific numerical problem-solving, highlighting its potential to augment expert workflows in medical imaging and therapeutic physics.

<title>PreSem-Surf: RGB-D Surface Reconstruction with Progressive Semantic Modeling and SG-MLP Pre-Rendering Mechanism</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB, depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance. Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP (Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering, allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding. Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

<title>RISE: Enhancing VLM Image Annotation with Self-Supervised Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.

Abstract: Demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system may have multiple causes, the most common are infections, autoimmune responses, genetic or vascular etiology. Demyelination lesions are characterized by areas were the myelin sheath of the nerve fibers are broken or destroyed. Among autoimmune disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known Among these disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known and aggressive form. Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is another type of demyelinating disease, typically with a better prognosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression by detecting lesions. While both adults and children can be affected, there is a significant lack of publicly available datasets for pediatric cases and demyelinating disorders beyond MS. This study introduces, for the first time, a publicly available pediatric dataset for demyelinating lesion segmentation. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients diagnosed with demyelinating disorders, including 3 with ADEM. In addition to lesion segmentation masks, the dataset includes extensive patient metadata, such as diagnosis, treatment, personal medical background, and laboratory results. To assess the quality of the dataset and demonstrate its relevance, we evaluate a state-of-the-art lesion segmentation model trained on an existing MS dataset. The results underscore the importance of diverse datasets

<title>Automated Cervical Cancer Detection through Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid in Resource-Poor Settings with Lightweight Deep Learning Models Deployed on an Android Device</title>

Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2 based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs, sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity of 88.37% on the test dataset and presents itself as a promising automated low-resource screening approach.

<title>InnerGS: Internal Scenes Rendering via Factorized 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external surfaces. In this work, we target the reconstruction of internal scenes, which is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Our approach eliminates the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with any data modalities. We provide cuda implementation at: https://github.com/Shuxin-Liang/InnerGS.

<div> Algorithm, Deformation modeling, Biomechanics, Surgical navigation, Augmented reality

Summary:
The article introduces a data-driven biomechanics algorithm for accurate deformation modeling in augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation. This algorithm aims to maintain alignment between preoperative organ models and intraoperative anatomy while improving computational efficiency. By incorporating a human-in-the-loop mechanism, surgeons can interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments, enhancing collaboration between surgeons and the algorithm. Experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate a mean target registration error of 3.42 mm, which is further reduced to 2.78 mm with surgeon prompts, surpassing existing methods in volumetric accuracy. The framework presented in this study offers a solution for efficient and accurate deformation modeling in complex surgical scenarios, ultimately leading to safer and more reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments, thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

<div> domain gap, diffusion planner, imitation learning, reinforcement learning, autonomous driving

Summary:
ReCogDrive is a proposed autonomous driving system that addresses performance degradation in rare scenarios. By integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a diffusion planner, it follows a three-stage training approach. The first stage involves training VLMs with a driving question-answering dataset to bridge the domain gap between generic content and real-world driving situations. In the second stage, a diffusion-based planner is used for imitation learning, translating representations from the language space to driving actions. Finally, fine-tuning with reinforcement learning using NAVSIM non-reactive simulator enhances safety and human-like driving behavior. ReCogDrive achieves a PDMS of 89.6 on the NAVSIM benchmark, outperforming the previous vision-only state-of-the-art by 5.6 PDMS.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Although end-to-end autonomous driving has made remarkable progress, its performance degrades significantly in rare and long-tail scenarios. Recent approaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from several limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data of VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the discrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation learning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which may be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an autonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which adopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a large-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating the domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving scenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform imitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to continuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using reinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model to generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories. We evaluate our approach on the planning-oriented NAVSIM benchmark, achieving a PDMS of 89.6 and setting a new state-of-the-art that surpasses the previous vision-only SOTA by 5.6 PDMS.

<div> benchmarking, cultural representativeness, text-to-image systems, CuRe, dataset

Summary:
The article introduces CuRe, a benchmarking and scoring suite for evaluating cultural representativeness in text-to-image (T2I) systems. The CuRe benchmark dataset is built from a categorical hierarchy of 300 cultural artifacts across 32 subcategories grouped into six cultural axes. Researchers analyzed the response of various T2I systems to increasing text conditioning informativeness to assess cultural biases. The study found strong correlations between CuRe scorers and human judgments on perceptual similarity, image-text alignment, and cultural diversity. Various image encoders, vision-language models, and text-to-image systems were evaluated using CuRe, including popular models like Stable Diffusion, FLUX.1, and DALL-E. The code and dataset are open-sourced for further research and development. The study aims to address the underrepresentation of Global South cultures in T2I systems trained on predominantly Amero and Euro-centric data.

Abstract: Popular text-to-image (T2I) systems are trained on web-scraped data, which is heavily Amero and Euro-centric, underrepresenting the cultures of the Global South. To analyze these biases, we introduce CuRe, a novel and scalable benchmarking and scoring suite for cultural representativeness that leverages the marginal utility of attribute specification to T2I systems as a proxy for human judgments. Our CuRe benchmark dataset has a novel categorical hierarchy built from the crowdsourced Wikimedia knowledge graph, with 300 cultural artifacts across 32 cultural subcategories grouped into six broad cultural axes (food, art, fashion, architecture, celebrations, and people). Our dataset's categorical hierarchy enables CuRe scorers to evaluate T2I systems by analyzing their response to increasing the informativeness of text conditioning, enabling fine-grained cultural comparisons. We empirically observe much stronger correlations of our class of scorers to human judgments of perceptual similarity, image-text alignment, and cultural diversity across image encoders (SigLIP 2, AIMV2 and DINOv2), vision-language models (OpenCLIP, SigLIP 2, Gemini 2.0 Flash) and state-of-the-art text-to-image systems, including three variants of Stable Diffusion (1.5, XL, 3.5 Large), FLUX.1 [dev], Ideogram 2.0, and DALL-E 3. The code and dataset is open-sourced and available at https://aniketrege.github.io/cure/.

<br>
Summary: Accurate mapping of canal networks is crucial for water management, including planning irrigation and maintaining infrastructure. Current semantic segmentation models for infrastructure mapping rely on well-annotated datasets, but incomplete ground truth can be a challenge. This paper introduces IGraSS, a novel iterative framework that combines a semantic segmentation module with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. By leveraging graph-level properties of infrastructure networks, IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments and improves canal identification accuracy. The framework is robust for refining noisy ground truth and mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. Additionally, IGraSS demonstrates effectiveness and generalizability by completing road networks using a different graph-theoretic constraint. <div>

Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large, well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI, DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification. IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example, applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

Summary: 
The article presents SpINRv2, a neural framework for highly accurate volumetric reconstruction using FMCW radar. This version builds upon previous work by addressing challenges associated with high start frequencies, such as phase aliasing and sub-bin ambiguity. The core innovation is a differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures complex radar responses and an implicit neural representation for continuous scene modeling. Unlike traditional methods, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency spectrum, maintaining spectral fidelity while reducing computational complexity. The framework also incorporates sparsity and smoothness regularization techniques to resolve sub-bin ambiguities at fine range resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that SpINRv2 outperforms classical and learning-based approaches, particularly in high-frequency scenarios, setting a new standard for neural radar-based 3D imaging.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions. Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes, establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

<div> Keywords: surgeon-specific fingerprinting, robotic surgery, vision-language-action pipeline, privacy-aware embedding, gesture prediction

Summary: 
Surgeons have distinct operating styles influenced by their training, experience, and motor behavior. However, current AI systems often overlook this personalization signal. A new approach is proposed to model fine-grained, surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery by integrating a discrete diffusion framework with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. This method formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task, using multimodal inputs such as endoscopic video, surgical intent language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill. Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is achieved through natural language prompts from third-party language models, ensuring individual behavioral style is retained without explicit identity exposure. Evaluation on the JIGSAWS dataset demonstrates accurate gesture sequence reconstruction and meaningful motion fingerprint learning unique to each surgeon. However, the study also highlights the trade-off between improved performance with personalized embeddings and increased vulnerability to identity leakage, emphasizing the need to balance personalization with privacy risk in surgical modeling. <div>

Abstract: Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training, experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained, surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task, conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill. Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon. To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage. These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical modeling.

<div> scene-graph generation, open-world, zero-shot, pretrained VLMs, relational understanding

Summary:
Open-World Scene-Graph Generation (SGG) framework utilizes pretrained Vision Language Models (VLMs) to generate scene graphs without requiring additional training. By treating SGG as a zero-shot reasoning problem, the framework employs multimodal prompting, embedding alignment, and a pair-refinement strategy to infer relationships between objects in images. This approach allows for inference over unseen object vocabularies and relation sets, extending the application to open-world settings with novel objects and relations. An Open-World evaluation protocol is formalized to measure performance in scenarios where no SGG-specific data have been observed. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained VLMs for relational understanding, showcasing the capability to perform scene-graph generation without task-specific training. <div>

Abstract: Scene-Graph Generation (SGG) seeks to recognize objects in an image and distill their salient pairwise relationships. Most methods depend on dataset-specific supervision to learn the variety of interactions, restricting their usefulness in open-world settings, involving novel objects and/or relations. Even methods that leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically require benchmark-specific fine-tuning. We introduce Open-World SGG, a training-free, efficient, model-agnostic framework that taps directly into the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to produce scene graphs with zero additional learning. Casting SGG as a zero-shot structured-reasoning problem, our method combines multimodal prompting, embedding alignment, and a lightweight pair-refinement strategy, enabling inference over unseen object vocabularies and relation sets. To assess this setting, we formalize an Open-World evaluation protocol that measures performance when no SGG-specific data have been observed either in terms of objects and relations. Experiments on Visual Genome, Open Images V6, and the Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) dataset demonstrate the capacity of pretrained VLMs to perform relational understanding without task-level training.

Summary: <br>
This study introduces enhancements to the Disentangler of Visual Priors (DVP) autoencoder architecture, allowing it to handle multiple objects in a scene and improve training efficiency through alternative loss functions. The DVP decomposes objects into independent visual aspects represented by latent parameters, enabling better interpretability. By extending the DVP and utilizing its latent decoder for sampling and alternative training modes, reconstruction quality is improved, especially for overlapping objects. A new benchmark dataset is proposed, compared with existing baselines MONet and LIVE, showcasing the DVP's superior performance. The analysis of gradients from different loss functions highlights their impact on training efficacy, providing insights into how differentiable rendering can be optimized in autoencoders. This study sheds light on the limitations of current approaches and suggests ways to address them. <br> <div>

Abstract: This study builds on the architecture of the Disentangler of Visual Priors (DVP), a type of autoencoder that learns to interpret scenes by decomposing the perceived objects into independent visual aspects of shape, size, orientation, and color appearance. These aspects are expressed as latent parameters which control a differentiable renderer that performs image reconstruction, so that the model can be trained end-to-end with gradient using reconstruction loss. In this study, we extend the original DVP so that it can handle multiple objects in a scene. We also exploit the interpretability of its latent by using the decoder to sample additional training examples and devising alternative training modes that rely on loss functions defined not only in the image space, but also in the latent space. This significantly facilitates training, which is otherwise challenging due to the presence of extensive plateaus in the image-space reconstruction loss. To examine the performance of this approach, we propose a new benchmark featuring multiple 2D objects, which subsumes the previously proposed Multi-dSprites dataset while being more parameterizable. We compare the DVP extended in these ways with two baselines (MONet and LIVE) and demonstrate its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality and capacity to decompose overlapping objects. We also analyze the gradients induced by the considered loss functions, explain how they impact the efficacy of training, and discuss the limitations of differentiable rendering in autoencoders and the ways in which they can be addressed.

Summary: 
The article introduces GIQ, a benchmark to evaluate geometric reasoning in vision and vision-language models. GIQ includes diverse polyhedra for testing monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation, and shape classification tasks. Results show that current models struggle with accurate reconstruction of basic geometric forms, although they can detect specific 3D symmetry elements. However, they perform poorly on tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Vision-language assistants also exhibit low accuracy on complex polyhedra, misunderstanding basic properties like face geometry and compound structures. GIQ aims to highlight and address gaps in geometric intelligence to improve representation learning. <div>

Abstract: Monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet their true understanding of geometric properties remains unclear. We introduce GIQ , a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in robust, geometry-aware representation learning.

Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12 different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

Summary:
This article discusses the use of high-resolution radar satellite images and computer vision models for remote monitoring of wetland areas. Traditional models require manual annotations, which are time-consuming and costly to produce. To address this issue, the authors propose a self-supervised training method using deep clustering and negative sampling to segment radar satellite images into water and land areas without manual annotations. An ensemble version of the model is implemented to enhance performance. The ensemble of self-supervised models outperforms a single fully-supervised model by achieving a 0.02 improvement in the Intersection Over Union metric on the test dataset. This approach offers a more efficient and cost-effective way to monitor wetlands using satellite imagery.

Abstract: In recent years the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite images along with the advancement of computer vision models have enabled the remote monitoring of the surface area of wetlands. However, these models require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow and expensive to produce. To overcome this problem, self-supervised training methods have been deployed to train models without using annotated data. In this paper we use a combination of deep clustering and negative sampling to train a model to segment radar satellite images into areas that separate water from land without the use of any manual annotations. Furthermore, we implement an ensemble version of the model to reduce variance and improve performance. Compared to a single fully-supervised model using the same architecture, our ensemble of self-supervised models achieves a 0.02 improvement in the Intersection Over Union metric over our test dataset.

Summary:
Our article addresses the limitations of supervised semantic correspondence methods in generalizing beyond sparsely annotated training keypoints. We propose a novel approach that learns dense correspondences by lifting 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using monocular depth estimation. This method constructs a continuous canonical manifold capturing object geometry without the need for explicit 3D supervision or camera annotations. Additionally, we introduce SPair-U, an extension of SPair-71k with new keypoint annotations to evaluate generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints, showcasing its effectiveness in learning robust correspondences. Surprisingly, unsupervised baselines outperform supervised counterparts when generalized across different datasets, suggesting the potential of unsupervised learning in this context. This research opens up new possibilities for improving semantic correspondence methods through innovative approaches and evaluation metrics.

Our method constructs a continuous canonical manifold that captures object geometry without requiring explicit 3D supervision or camera annotations. Additionally, we introduce SPair-U, an extension of SPair-71k with novel keypoint annotations, to better assess generalization. Experiments not only demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints, highlighting its effectiveness in learning robust correspondences, but that unsupervised baselines outperform supervised counterparts when generalized across different datasets.

<div> Keywords: benchmarks, vision-language models, compositional understanding, biases, recommendations <br>
Summary:<br> 
The study examines 17 common benchmarks used to measure the compositional understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). By analyzing the design choices in benchmark construction, such as data sources and curation procedures, the researchers identify inherent biases in the benchmarks. They find that blind heuristics perform similarly to CLIP models, suggesting that the benchmarks may not effectively assess compositional understanding. The primary issue identified is a distribution imbalance between positive and negative images/captions, stemming from the benchmark construction processes. To address these challenges, the study offers recommendations for developing more robust vision-language compositional understanding benchmarks that are less susceptible to simple attacks. <br>

Abstract: We investigate 17 benchmarks (e.g. SugarCREPE, VALSE) commonly used for measuring compositional understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). We scrutinize design choices in their construction, including data source (e.g. MS-COCO) and curation procedures (e.g. constructing negative images/captions), uncovering several inherent biases across most benchmarks. We find that blind heuristics (e.g. token-length, log-likelihood under a language model) perform on par with CLIP models, indicating that these benchmarks do not effectively measure compositional understanding. We demonstrate that the underlying factor is a distribution asymmetry between positive and negative images/captions, induced by the benchmark construction procedures. To mitigate these issues, we provide a few key recommendations for constructing more robust vision-language compositional understanding benchmarks, that would be less prone to such simple attacks.

<div> tokenizer, image editing, generative capabilities, gradient-based optimization, image generation

Summary:
The study introduces a novel 1D image tokenizer that produces highly compressed one-dimensional sequences of tokens for image representation. This tokenizer enables image editing and generative capabilities through heuristic manipulation of tokens, allowing for fine-grained editing by transferring attributes between latent representations of images. The expressivity of the 1D tokenizer's latent space is leveraged to construct an image generation pipeline that uses gradient-based optimization of tokens with various loss functions like reconstruction or CLIP similarity. This approach is demonstrated in inpainting and text-guided image editing scenarios, producing diverse and realistic samples without the need for training a generative model. The study showcases the potential of 1D image tokenization for efficient and effective image manipulation and generation tasks.

Abstract: Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any generative model.

<div> audio-to-video generation, Mirage, self-attention, speech synthesis, multimodal video<br>
Summary:<br>
The article introduces Mirage, a model that generates realistic video from audio input. Mirage integrates audio and video elements to create compelling multimodal video, particularly suited for speech synthesis tasks. The model is trained on audio-video footage of people talking, resulting in believable performances matching the input audio. Mirage's technical innovation lies in a unified method for training self-attention-based audio-to-video models, ensuring high-quality outputs without audio-specific architectures. Mirage's effectiveness in audio-to-video generation is showcased through subjective quality assessments and real-world applications. Viewers are encouraged to experience Mirage's capabilities firsthand through provided links. <div>

Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

It explores the concept of dispersion in generalized attention and presents the Scalable and Efficient Mamba like Attention (SEMA) model, which uses token localization to maintain focus and avoid dispersion.

Abstract: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses, that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter sizes.

Abstract: Reflection removal technology plays a crucial role in photography and computer vision applications. However, existing techniques are hindered by the lack of high-quality in-the-wild datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for collecting reflection datasets from a fresh perspective. Our approach is convenient, cost-effective, and scalable, while ensuring that the collected data pairs are of high quality, perfectly aligned, and represent natural and diverse scenarios. Following this paradigm, we collect a Real-world, Diverse, and Pixel-aligned dataset (named OpenRR-1k dataset), which contains 1,000 high-quality transmission-reflection image pairs collected in the wild. Through the analysis of several reflection removal methods and benchmark evaluation experiments on our dataset, we demonstrate its effectiveness in improving robustness in challenging real-world environments. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-1k.

Summary: <br>
The paper introduces STNet, a novel network architecture for hyperspectral image classification. STNet addresses challenges like high-dimensionality and sparse ground object distribution by using a Spatial-Spectral Transformer module. This module decouples spatial and spectral attention to capture key information effectively. By incorporating adaptive attention fusion gating and GFFN gating mechanisms, STNet enhances feature extraction and fusion capabilities while reducing overfitting risks. The proposed method outperforms traditional convolutional neural networks on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, demonstrating superior performance in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances model representation without increasing network depth or width. <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

<div> Keywords: racket sports, ball impact, event camera, real-time location, player performance measurement

Summary: 
The article discusses a method for real-time location of the tennis ball impact on the racket using an event camera in racket sports like tennis. The importance of accurately determining the impact position for analyzing player and equipment characteristics is highlighted. High-speed cameras are typically used for this purpose but face limitations in memory consumption and time-consuming manual digitization. The proposed method overcomes these limitations by utilizing event cameras, which efficiently measure brightness changes with high accuracy and lower memory consumption, allowing for prolonged scene capture. The method involves three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact, and contours of the ball and racket. By incorporating conventional computer vision techniques and original event-based processing, the method successfully detects the timing at impact (PATS) with results aligning with measuring tennis players' performance within a permissible range. Additionally, the computations are fast enough for real-time applications. <div>

Abstract: In racket sports, such as tennis, locating the ball's position at impact is important in clarifying player and equipment characteristics, thereby aiding in personalized equipment design. High-speed cameras are used to measure the impact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged scene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming and prone to human error. These limitations make it difficult to effectively capture the entire playing scene, hindering the ability to analyze the player's performance. We propose a method for locating the tennis ball impact on the racket in real time using an event camera. Event cameras efficiently measure brightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed motion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to continuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method consists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact, and contours of ball and racket. Conventional computer vision techniques are utilized along with an original event-based processing to detect the timing at impact (PATS: the amount of polarity asymmetry in time symmetry). The results of the experiments were within the permissible range for measuring tennis players' performance. Moreover, the computation time was sufficiently short for real-time applications.

Summary:
Step AG is proposed as a universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy for text-to-vision generation diffusion models. This strategy focuses on restricting classifier-free guidance to the initial denoising steps to generate high-quality, well-conditioned images. Evaluations show an average speedup of 20-30% in image generation while maintaining image-text alignment. The method is effective across different settings and models, including video generation models. This approach addresses the issue of increased costs associated with classifier-free guidance in conditioning models, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency in generating high-quality images. <div>
arXiv:2506.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models, classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work, we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Different medical imaging modalities capture diagnostic information at varying spatial resolutions, from coarse global patterns to fine-grained localized structures. However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the medical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction, overlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a modular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically adapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type, which routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches trained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate over feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling spatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework produces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions, without requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results on diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and retrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language systems.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces a new method called Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoiréing (DCID) to address the challenge of removing moiré patterns from images captured from electronic screens. The DCID method utilizes the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist in moiré removal from the wide-angle (W) image. The motivation behind this approach is the common presence of two lenses in modern smartphones and the ability of the UW image to provide normal colors and textures even when moiré is present in the W image. The DCID method includes a lightweight UW image encoder integrated into a demoiréing network and a fast two-stage image alignment process. Additionally, a large-scale real-world dataset containing about 9,000 samples from diverse mobile phones and monitors was constructed for experiments. Results demonstrate that the DCID method outperforms existing state-of-the-art demoiréing methods. The code and dataset are publicly available for further research and development.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: When shooting electronic screens, moir\'e patterns usually appear in captured images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoir\'eing methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moir\'e. To address the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoir\'eing (DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moir\'e removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image generally can provide normal colors and textures when moir\'e exists in the W image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into an existing demoir\'eing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Mrduckk/DCID.

Summary: 
The article presents a novel approach, Radio Deep Unfolding Network (RadioDUN), for estimating dense radio maps from sparse samples. By casting the problem as sparse signal recovery and incorporating a physical propagation model, RadioDUN is able to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization sub-problems, reducing recovery complexity. The network unfolds the optimization process, allowing for adaptive parameter adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. A dynamic reweighting module (DRM) is introduced to adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map, while obstacle-related factors are integrated to account for obstacle-induced signal decay. The proposed shadowing loss further enhances performance by constraining factor prediction and acting as a supplementary supervised objective. Extensive experiments show that RadioDUN outperforms existing methods, making it a promising approach for efficient resource allocation and interference mitigation in radio networks. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network (RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Summary: <br>
The article discusses the challenges faced in improving the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to noisy alignments and ambiguous text. To address this, the authors propose SCALE, a data selection pipeline that evaluates the quality of VLM instruction tuning datasets. SCALE integrates a cross-modality assessment framework to assign tasks, generate captions, and evaluate alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each data entry. The study shows that current unimodal assessment methods are limited and that appropriately generated image captions can efficiently transfer the multimodal task into a unified text modality. This approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of VLMs by selecting high-quality data entries essential for specific tasks and improving model robustness.<br> <div>

Abstract: The application of visual instruction tuning and other post-training techniques has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in visual understanding, enriching Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with more comprehensive visual language datasets. However, the effectiveness of VLMs is highly dependent on large-scale, high-quality datasets that ensure precise recognition and accurate reasoning. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1) noisy alignments between images and the corresponding text, which leads to misinterpretation, and (2) ambiguous or misleading text, which obscures visual content. To address these challenges, we propose SCALE (Single modality data quality and Cross modality Alignment Evaluation), a novel quality-driven data selection pipeline for VLM instruction tuning datasets. Specifically, SCALE integrates a cross-modality assessment framework that first assigns each data entry to its appropriate vision-language task, generates general and task-specific captions (covering scenes, objects, style, etc.), and evaluates the alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each entry based on the generated captions. We reveal that: (1) current unimodal quality assessment methods evaluate one modality while overlooking the rest, which can underestimate samples essential for specific tasks and discard the lower-quality instances that help build model robustness; and (2) appropriately generated image captions provide an efficient way to transfer the image-text multimodal task into a unified text modality.

Summary:
The study focuses on improving the visual controllability of image-to-video (I2V) generation models by addressing the issue of static videos due to the suppression of motion dynamics. The proposed solution, adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), adjusts the frequency content of the input image to generate more dynamic videos without sacrificing image fidelity. By modulating the conditioning image with low-pass filtering at the early denoising stage, ALG significantly enhances the temporal dynamics of the generated videos while maintaining high video quality and text alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that ALG improves the dynamic degree of videos by 36% on average, particularly evident in the VBench-I2V test suite. This approach offers a simple yet effective fix to overcome the challenge of achieving dynamic video outputs in I2V models.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in producing high-quality, dynamic videos. To improve the visual controllability, recent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses motion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared to their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and identify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in the input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory that overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this, we propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model sampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising per-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency content of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early stage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly improves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image fidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG achieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant drop in video quality or image fidelity.

Summary: <br>
Pretrained models have shown success in various modalities, including imaging. This study introduces a masked autoencoder for modeling transient imaging (MARMOT) for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. MARMOT, pre-trained on diverse NLOS transient datasets, uses a scanning pattern mask (SPM) to learn features from masked transients and predict full measurements. Pretrained on a large dataset, MARMOT can adapt to downstream tasks either through feature transfer or decoder fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments and comparisons, MARMOT proves to be efficient in NLOS imaging applications. <div>

Abstract: Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of 500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces a new framework, UniCaCLF, for temporal forgery localization in audio-visual content. Unlike previous works focusing on deepfake detection as a classification task, UniCaCLF addresses the challenge of detecting small fake segments within real videos. It utilizes supervised contrastive learning to identify forged instants through anomaly detection, enabling precise temporal forgery localization. A context-aware perception layer enhances feature discriminability by contrasting genuine and forged instant features with a novel context-aware contrastive objective. An efficient contrastive coding approach further improves distinguishability by suppressing cross-sample influence. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that UniCaCLF outperforms existing algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and localizing temporal forgeries in multimedia content. <br> <div>

Abstract: Most research efforts in the multimedia forensics domain have focused on detecting forgery audio-visual content and reached sound achievements. However, these works only consider deepfake detection as a classification task and ignore the case where partial segments of the video are tampered with. Temporal forgery localization (TFL) of small fake audio-visual clips embedded in real videos is still challenging and more in line with realistic application scenarios. To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware contrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages supervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by means of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal forged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer that utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context updater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the discriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine instant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An efficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the limit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants in a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence to improve temporal forgery localization performance. Extensive experimental results over five public datasets demonstrate that our proposed UniCaCLF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.

Summary: 
MLVTG introduces a novel framework for Video Temporal Grounding that outperforms existing Transformer-based methods. The framework consists of two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses Vision Mamba blocks instead of Transformers for temporal modeling and robust video representation extraction. LLMRefiner leverages a pre-trained Large Language Model's frozen layer to enhance multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning, improving localization precision. The dual alignment strategy combines temporal modeling through structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification through textual priors. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum datasets confirm MLVTG's state-of-the-art performance. <div>

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach for visual localization in dynamic environments, where conditions such as lighting changes and moving objects make pose regression challenging. The proposed framework combines multi-scale feature learning with semantic scene understanding using a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention. This allows for the fusion of geometric details and contextual cues to maintain spatial precision while adapting to environmental changes. The architecture is further improved with semantic supervision via neural scene representation during training, guiding the network to learn view-invariant features that encode structural information and suppress environmental interference. Experimental results on the TartanAir dataset demonstrate that the approach outperforms existing pose regression methods in scenarios with dynamic objects, illumination changes, and occlusions. The integration of multi-scale processing with semantic guidance shows promise for robust visual localization in real-world dynamic environments.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Visual localization remains challenging in dynamic environments where fluctuating lighting, adverse weather, and moving objects disrupt appearance cues. Despite advances in feature representation, current absolute pose regression methods struggle to maintain consistency under varying conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that synergistically combines multi-scale feature learning with semantic scene understanding. Our approach employs a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention to fuse geometric details and contextual cues, preserving spatial precision while adapting to environmental changes. We improve the performance of this architecture with semantic supervision via neural scene representation during training, guiding the network to learn view-invariant features that encode persistent structural information while suppressing complex environmental interference. Experiments on TartanAir demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pose regression methods in challenging scenarios with dynamic objects, illumination changes, and occlusions. Our findings show that integrating multi-scale processing with semantic guidance offers a promising strategy for robust visual localization in real-world dynamic environments.

Summary:<br>
LiftVSR is a new video super-resolution framework that enhances perceptual quality while reducing computational costs. It leverages image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$ and achieves state-of-the-art results using only 4×RTX 4090 GPUs. The framework introduces a hybrid temporal modeling mechanism with Dynamic Temporal Attention for fine-grained temporal modeling and Attention Memory Cache for long-term temporal consistency. Dynamic Temporal Attention warps inter-frame contexts within short frame segments with low complexity, while Attention Memory Cache aggregates historical segment information for long-term coherence. An asymmetric sampling strategy is utilized to stabilize cache interaction during inference. LiftVSR demonstrates impressive performance on various VSR benchmarks with significantly lower computational costs. <br> <div>
arXiv:2506.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$, achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii) Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments ($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces the concept of Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH) based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), suggesting that concept-aligned directions in deep networks originate in the input space and amplify with depth. The Spectral Principal Path (SPP) framework formalizes how deep networks distill linear representations along dominant spectral directions, advancing a structured theory of representation formation. The study also demonstrates the multimodal robustness of these representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), highlighting the importance of understanding and improving AI transparency, fairness, and robustness in deep learning models. <div>

Abstract: High-level representations have become a central focus in enhancing AI transparency and control, shifting attention from individual neurons or circuits to structured semantic directions that align with human-interpretable concepts. Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP) framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI robustness, fairness, and transparency.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach to cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition that eliminates the need for subject-specific calibration data. The proposed method involves using a dual-branch adversarial neural network to disentangle EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific components. This disentanglement allows for effective pattern recognition for new users without the need for individual calibration. Additionally, the model enables the identification of individuals based on their unique EMG signals, opening up possibilities for task-invariant biometric systems. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms various baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios and demonstrates robust performance on data from unseen users. Overall, this study presents a new paradigm for EMG pattern recognition that does not require model calibration and showcases the potential for broader applications in the field.

Abstract: Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as task-independent biometric systems.

Summary: <br> 
The article introduces FCA-NIG, a framework that automatically creates navigation instructions with detailed cross-modal annotations to improve Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks. It generates the FCA-R2R dataset, which includes precise sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Training VLN agents with this dataset enhances their performance significantly. The framework divides trajectories into sub-trajectories, detects landmarks using GLIP, constructs instructions with OFA-Speaker and CLIP, and generates annotations at both sub-instruction-trajectory and entity-landmark levels. This approach improves agents' awareness, decision-making, and navigation accuracy. Experimental results show performance enhancements for various state-of-the-art VLN agents trained with FCA-R2R data. FCA-NIG proves effective in generating high-quality training data at scale without the need for manual annotation, advancing cross-modal learning in complex navigation tasks. <br> <div>
arXiv:2506.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables intelligent agents to navigate environments by integrating visual perception and natural language instructions, yet faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of fine-grained cross-modal alignment annotations. Existing datasets primarily focus on global instruction-trajectory matching, neglecting sub-instruction-level and entity-level alignments critical for accurate navigation action decision-making. To address this limitation, we propose FCA-NIG, a generative framework that automatically constructs navigation instructions with dual-level fine-grained cross-modal annotations. In this framework, an augmented trajectory is first divided into sub-trajectories, which are then processed through GLIP-based landmark detection, crafted instruction construction, OFA-Speaker based R2R-like instruction generation, and CLIP-powered entity selection, generating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs with entity-landmark annotations. Finally, these sub-pairs are aggregated to form a complete instruction-trajectory pair. The framework generates the FCA-R2R dataset, the first large-scale augmentation dataset featuring precise sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with FCA-R2R significantly improves the performance of multiple state-of-the-art VLN agents, including SF, EnvDrop, RecBERT, and HAMT. Incorporating sub-instruction-trajectory alignment enhances agents' state awareness and decision accuracy, while entity-landmark alignment further boosts navigation performance and generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness of FCA-NIG in generating high-quality, scalable training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal learning in complex navigation tasks.

Summary:<br>
This paper introduces a Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction (DGMR) method to reduce the parameters of large vision transformers significantly while maintaining performance. By pruning redundant neurons in MLP hidden layers using a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy, weight diversity is preserved for better performance recovery during distillation. Experimental results show that the pruned models achieve more than a 57.0% reduction in parameters and FLOPs in a near lossless manner. The method allows for a 71.5% reduction in parameters and FLOPs for the EVA-CLIP-E model without performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available for further exploration. <br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules take up the majority of model parameters.
To this end, we focus on the recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B), our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without performance degradation.

<br>
Summary: Transformers are increasingly used in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for learning long-range dependencies, but challenges remain in the field. A comprehensive survey of over 300 papers up to 2025 examines various stages of Transformer-based HSI classification pipelines. The study categorizes different components such as pre-processing, tokenization, feature extraction, and loss design, and highlights the unique properties of HSI data. The review identifies key challenges including the scarcity of labeled data, high spectral dimensionality, computational complexity, and limited explainability of models. To address these challenges, a research agenda is proposed focusing on public data sets, lightweight models for on-edge deployment, robustness to illumination and sensor shifts, and interpretable attention mechanisms. The goal is to assist researchers in selecting, combining, and extending Transformer components for effective next-generation HSI applications.  <br> <div>

Abstract: Transformers have become the architecture of choice for learning long-range dependencies, yet their adoption in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is still emerging. We reviewed more than 300 papers published up to 2025 and present the first end-to-end survey dedicated to Transformer-based HSI classification. The study categorizes every stage of a typical pipeline-pre-processing, patch or pixel tokenization, positional encoding, spatial-spectral feature extraction, multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles: scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead, and limited model explainability. Finally, we outline a research agenda prioritizing valuable public data sets, lightweight on-edge models, illumination and sensor shifts robustness, and intrinsically interpretable attention mechanisms. Our goal is to guide researchers in selecting, combining, or extending Transformer components that are truly fit for purpose for next-generation HSI applications.

<div> Adversarial Training, Adversarial Robustness Distillation, smoothness degree, Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation, robust fairness

Summary:
Adversarial Training (AT) and Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) are effective in enhancing the robustness of small models, but both face robust fairness issues. Models trained using AT and ARD tend to perform strongly against some classes while showing weakness against others. The smoothness degree of soft labels for different classes significantly affects robust fairness. To address this, this paper proposes Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge Distillation framework. ABSLD reduces the error risk gap between classes by adjusting the smoothness degree of teacher's soft labels, using varying temperatures for different classes. ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing both robustness and fairness. <div>

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is widely recognized as an effective approach to enhance the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. As a variant of AT, Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has shown outstanding performance in enhancing the robustness of small models. However, both AT and ARD face robust fairness issue: these models tend to display strong adversarial robustness against some classes (easy classes) while demonstrating weak adversarial robustness against others (hard classes). This paper explores the underlying factors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for different classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we propose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge Distillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness. Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between different classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness degree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment is managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes. Additionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be integrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of robustness and fairness.

Abstract: Deep Learning requires large amounts of data to train models that work well. In data-deficient settings, performance can be degraded. We investigate which Deep Learning methods benefit training models in a data-deficient setting, by organizing the "VIPriors: Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep Learning" workshop series, featuring four editions of data-impaired challenges. These challenges address the problem of training deep learning models for computer vision tasks with limited data. Participants are limited to training models from scratch using a low number of training samples and are not allowed to use any form of transfer learning. We aim to stimulate the development of novel approaches that incorporate prior knowledge to improve the data efficiency of deep learning models. Successful challenge entries make use of large model ensembles that mix Transformers and CNNs, as well as heavy data augmentation. Novel prior knowledge-based methods contribute to success in some entries.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces SAMSelect, an algorithm designed to create a three-channel visualization for multispectral images, specifically targeting marine debris analysis in Sentinel-2 imagery. SAMSelect aims to assist marine scientists in visually interpreting floating marine debris, which can be challenging due to their varied composition. This algorithm selects the most effective band or index combination for accurate segmentation results by utilizing the Segment Anything Model. By evaluating SAMSelect in various Sentinel-2 scenes, including those in Accra and Durban, it was found that new band combinations, such as a normalized difference index of B8 and B2, outperformed existing indices in literature. The algorithm's open-source code repository offers valuable tools for marine scientists engaged in visual photo interpretation, enhancing their ability to analyze and interpret marine debris imagery effectively. <br>
Summary: <div>

Abstract: This work proposes SAMSelect, an algorithm to obtain a salient three-channel visualization for multispectral images. We develop SAMSelect and show its use for marine scientists visually interpreting floating marine debris in Sentinel-2 imagery. These debris are notoriously difficult to visualize due to their compositional heterogeneity in medium-resolution imagery. Out of these difficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains a common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a case-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect selects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification accuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model. Its central assumption is that the three-channel visualization achieves the most accurate segmentation results also provide good visual information for photo-interpretation.
  We evaluate SAMSelect in three Sentinel-2 scenes containing generic marine debris in Accra, Ghana, and Durban, South Africa, and deployed plastic targets from the Plastic Litter Project. This reveals the potential of new previously unused band combinations (e.g., a normalized difference index of B8, B2), which demonstrate improved performance compared to literature-based indices. We describe the algorithm in this paper and provide an open-source code repository that will be helpful for domain scientists doing visual photo interpretation, especially in the marine field.

Abstract: Several variants of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have significantly improved the accuracy of synthesized images and surface reconstruction of 3D scenes/objects. In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can train the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every pixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability issues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D points along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the sampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage the implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a probability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more targeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved rendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for improved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image projection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space components. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into current state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering, especially for the regions of interest in any given scene.

Abstract: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation, dubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based framework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6% mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M parameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.

<div> Generative models, video synthesis, video editing, robotic learning, dataset scarcity <br>
Summary: <br>
Recent advancements in generative models have led to significant progress in video synthesis and editing, but the lack of diverse high-quality datasets hinders robotic learning. To address the challenge of swapping robotic arms between videos for cross-embodiment learning, a new framework called RoboSwap is introduced. Unlike previous methods requiring paired video demonstrations in similar environments, RoboSwap operates on unpaired data from diverse settings, reducing the need for extensive data collection. The framework combines GANs and diffusion models in a novel video editing pipeline to segment and translate robotic arms while ensuring coherence, motion realism, and object interaction. By training the GAN and diffusion stages independently, RoboSwap achieves superior performance over existing models in terms of structural coherence and motion consistency on multiple benchmarks, providing a robust solution for generating cross-embodiment data in robotic learning. <br> <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

Summary: 
The article presents a novel surface reconstruction algorithm for unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. It introduces a fast and accurate method that outperforms existing techniques in terms of speed and performance. The algorithm utilizes a lazy query approach for feature extraction, eliminating the need for query points during the early stages. Additionally, a parallel multi-scale grid representation is employed to enhance feature robustness across different noise levels and input resolutions. Furthermore, the integration of attention mechanisms across scales leads to improved reconstruction results. Overall, the proposed algorithm achieves a superior accuracy-speed trade-off compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it an efficient solution for reconstructing general 3D shapes from unorganized point clouds. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. Recent learning methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can provide improved reconstruction results.

Summary: <br>
The research introduces the concept of orientation-aligned 3D object generation, aiming to produce 3D objects with consistent orientations from single images. A dataset called Objaverse-OA is constructed with orientation-aligned 3D models across various categories to facilitate this task. Two 3D generative models are fine-tuned using this dataset, resulting in aligned objects that generalize well to unseen categories. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the method compared to post-hoc alignment techniques. The study demonstrates downstream applications of aligned object generation, including zero-shot object orientation estimation through analysis-by-synthesis and arrow-based object rotation manipulation. <div>

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive object shape and orientation from a single image, guided by strong priors about canonical poses. However, existing 3D generative models often produce misaligned results due to inconsistent training data, limiting their usability in downstream tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the task of orientation-aligned 3D object generation: producing 3D objects from single images with consistent orientations across categories. To facilitate this, we construct Objaverse-OA, a dataset of 14,832 orientation-aligned 3D models spanning 1,008 categories. Leveraging Objaverse-OA, we fine-tune two representative 3D generative models based on multi-view diffusion and 3D variational autoencoder frameworks to produce aligned objects that generalize well to unseen objects across various categories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over post-hoc alignment approaches. Furthermore, we showcase downstream applications enabled by our aligned object generation, including zero-shot object orientation estimation via analysis-by-synthesis and efficient arrow-based object rotation manipulation.

Abstract: Video memorability refers to the ability of videos to be recalled after viewing, playing a crucial role in creating content that remains memorable. Existing models typically focus on extracting multimodal features to predict video memorability scores but often fail to fully utilize motion cues. The representation of motion features is compromised during the fine-tuning phase of the motion feature extractor due to a lack of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce the Text-Motion Cross-modal Contrastive Loss (TMCCL), a multimodal video memorability prediction model designed to enhance the representation of motion features. We tackle the challenge of improving motion feature representation by leveraging text description similarities across videos to establish positive and negative motion sample sets for a given target. This enhancement allows the model to learn similar feature representations for semantically related motion content, resulting in more accurate memorability predictions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video memorability prediction datasets. Moreover, the potential applications of video memorability prediction have been underexplored. To address this gap, we present Memorability Weighted Correction for Video Summarization (MWCVS), using video memorability prediction to reduce subjectivity in video summarization labels. Experimental results on two video summarization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MWCVS, showcasing the promising applications of video memorability prediction.

Abstract: Multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5 achieve state-of-the-art visual understanding through visual instruction tuning on multitask datasets, enabling strong instruction-following and multimodal performance. However, multitask learning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment of data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic forgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising alternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing capabilities. However, current methods prioritize task-specific performance, neglecting base model degradation from overfitting to specific instructions, which undermines general capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware consolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization to prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific performance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance and preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that task-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass multitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders, preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.

Abstract: Canada experienced in 2023 one of the most severe wildfire seasons in recent history, causing damage across ecosystems, destroying communities, and emitting large quantities of CO2. This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a climate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season that affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower wildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions. Wildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the likelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future wildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data has enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models, aiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and temporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on coarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to wildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\sim 0.1${\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and baseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada, leveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite images (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and environmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two major deep learning architectures. We observe that using multi-modal temporal inputs outperforms single-modal temporal inputs across all metrics, achieving a peak performance of 60.3% in F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, a season never seen during model training. This demonstrates the potential of multi-modal deep learning models for wildfire forecasting at high-resolution and continental scale.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown exceptional performance in multimodal tasks, but their effectiveness in complex visual reasoning is still constrained, especially when employing Chain-of-Thought prompting techniques. In this paper, we propose VReST, a novel training-free approach that enhances Reasoning in LVLMs through Monte Carlo Tree Search and Self-Reward mechanisms. VReST meticulously traverses the reasoning landscape by establishing a search tree, where each node encapsulates a reasoning step, and each path delineates a comprehensive reasoning sequence. Our innovative multimodal Self-Reward mechanism assesses the quality of reasoning steps by integrating the utility of sub-questions, answer correctness, and the relevance of vision-language clues, all without the need for additional models. VReST surpasses current prompting methods and secures state-of-the-art performance across three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, it substantiates the efficacy of test-time scaling laws in multimodal tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel- and patch-level representations, but extending it to videos remains challenging due to the complexity of motion dynamics. Existing approaches struggle as they rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main

Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made public to accelerate research in generalizable 3DGS scene understanding.

<title>Geometric deep learning for local growth prediction on abdominal aortic aneurysm surfaces</title>

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24 AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of 1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93). Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

Abstract: Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood. Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior parameter and computational efficiency. The source code will be available at https://github.com/Wake1021/InceptionMamba.

<title>RS-MTDF: Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion for Remote Sensing Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale, high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization. We propose that Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets, possess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS Potsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed module.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in 2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct 3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.

Abstract: The Landsat program offers over 50 years of globally consistent Earth imagery. However, the lack of benchmarks for this data constrains progress towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet, including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and BigEarthNet-L.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a task that distinguishes normal and abnormal data, which is important for applying automation technologies of the manufacturing facilities. For MVTec dataset that is a representative AD dataset for industrial environment, many recent works have shown remarkable performances. However, the existing anomaly detection works have a limitation of showing good performance for fully-aligned datasets only, unlike real-world industrial environments. To solve this limitation, we propose HomographyAD, a novel deep anomaly detection methodology based on the ImageNet-pretrained network, which is specially designed for actual industrial dataset. Specifically, we first suggest input foreground alignment using the deep homography estimation method. In addition, we fine-tune the model by self homography learning to learn additional shape information from normal samples. Finally, we conduct anomaly detection based on the measure of how far the feature of test sample is from the distribution of the extracted normal features. By applying our proposed method to various existing AD approaches, we show performance enhancement through extensive experiments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for single-image dehazing. By integrating the atmospheric scattering model with nonlocal regularization and dark channel prior, we propose the improved PDE: \[ -\text{div}\left(D(\nabla u)\nabla u\right) + \lambda(t) G(u) = \Phi(I,t,A) \] where $D(\nabla u) = (|\nabla u| + \epsilon)^{-1}$ is the edge-preserving diffusion coefficient, $G(u)$ is the Gaussian convolution operator, and $\lambda(t)$ is the adaptive regularization parameter based on transmission map $t$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $H_0^1(\Omega)$ using Lax-Milgram theorem, and implement an efficient fixed-point iteration scheme accelerated by PyTorch GPU computation. The experimental results demonstrate that this method is a promising deghazing solution that can be generalized to the deep model paradigm.

Abstract: Recently, the rectified flow (RF) has emerged as the new state-of-the-art among flow-based diffusion models due to its high efficiency advantage in straight path sampling, especially with the amazing images generated by a series of RF models such as Flux 1.0 and SD 3.0. Although a straight-line connection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast, and easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns, which arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling space. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow only needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\bm v$ between the two distributions $\bm\pi_0$ and $\bm\pi_1$. In this work, we present Discretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow models since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random velocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path into a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'') to expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution $p_\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly superimposed on $\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\bm v$ of the sub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and multi-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several representative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by sampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse and efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.

Abstract: To address key limitations in human-object interaction (HOI) video generation -- specifically the reliance on curated motion data, limited generalization to novel objects/scenarios, and restricted accessibility -- we introduce HunyuanVideo-HOMA, a weakly conditioned multimodal-driven framework. HunyuanVideo-HOMA enhances controllability and reduces dependency on precise inputs through sparse, decoupled motion guidance. It encodes appearance and motion signals into the dual input space of a multimodal diffusion transformer (MMDiT), fusing them within a shared context space to synthesize temporally consistent and physically plausible interactions. To optimize training, we integrate a parameter-space HOI adapter initialized from pretrained MMDiT weights, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient adaptation, and a facial cross-attention adapter for anatomically accurate audio-driven lip synchronization. Extensive experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance in interaction naturalness and generalization under weak supervision. Finally, HunyuanVideo-HOMA demonstrates versatility in text-conditioned generation and interactive object manipulation, supported by a user-friendly demo interface.

Abstract: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel diffusion based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting via resolution-guided progressive inference. It progressively extracts global structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. It further incorporates frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory usage by up to 31.25% and inference time by up to 18.15%, and maintains inpainting accuracy across datasets, resolutions, and mask conditions.

Abstract: Video content comprehension is essential for various applications, ranging from video analysis to interactive systems. Despite advancements in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), these models often struggle to capture the nuanced, spatiotemporal details essential for thorough video analysis. To address this gap, we introduce Video-CoT, a groundbreaking dataset designed to enhance spatiotemporal understanding using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodologies. Video-CoT contains 192,000 fine-grained spa-tiotemporal question-answer pairs and 23,000 high-quality CoT-annotated samples, providing a solid foundation for evaluating spatiotemporal understanding in video comprehension. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video analysis capabilities. By making these resources publicly available, we aim to encourage further exploration in this critical area. Project website:https://video-cot.github.io/ .

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining superficial organs and tissues, including lymph nodes, breast, and thyroid. It employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals. Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes, highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker expression.

Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3) maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily long video streams. Code and models are available at https://github.com/nickwzk/StreamSplat.

Abstract: The parameter-efficient adaptation of the image-text pretraining model CLIP for video-text retrieval is a prominent area of research. While CLIP is focused on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment discrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous methods by 1.5% in R@1, reaching a final score of 50.5% R@1. The code is available at https://github.com/LunarShen/DsicoVLA.

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat, the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures. These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in ophthalmology training. The dataset and annotations are publicly available in Synapse https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn66401174/files.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available: https://github.com/j-morano/MIRAGE.

<title>Hyperbolic Dual Feature Augmentation for Open-Environment</title>

Abstract: Feature augmentation generates novel samples in the feature space, providing an effective way to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms with hyperbolic geometry. Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment, which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks: class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in open-environment.

<title>SkipVAR: Accelerating Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Adaptive Frequency-Aware Skipping</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08908</link>

Abstract: Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal. Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost. Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and has been publicly released.

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction. Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2 leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage 1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Abstract: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, MLLM-based virtual agents have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, existing benchmarks face significant limitations, including uncontrollable task complexity, extensive manual annotation with limited scenarios, and a lack of multidimensional evaluation. In response to these challenges, we introduce OmniBench, a self-generating, cross-platform, graph-based benchmark with an automated pipeline for synthesizing tasks of controllable complexity through subtask composition. To evaluate the diverse capabilities of virtual agents on the graph, we further present OmniEval, a multidimensional evaluation framework that includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91\% human acceptance rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it can more efficiently guide agents compared to manually annotated data. We conduct multidimensional evaluations for various open-source and closed-source models, revealing their performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future advancements. Our project is available at https://omni-bench.github.io/.

Abstract: In the era of information explosion, efficiently leveraging large-scale unlabeled data while minimizing the reliance on high-quality pixel-level annotations remains a critical challenge in the field of medical imaging. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enhances the utilization of unlabeled data by facilitating knowledge transfer, significantly improving the performance of fully supervised models and emerging as a highly promising research direction in medical image analysis. Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models (e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised SAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction capabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus effectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream "weak-to-strong" consistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative Feature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature discrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across multiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across multi-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the features, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a prompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a Sliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data, fulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical image segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably, SSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice. Code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/SSS.

<title>Cross-Spectral Body Recognition with Side Information Embedding: Benchmarks on LLCM and Analyzing Range-Induced Occlusions on IJB-MDF</title>

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of biometric tasks, including face and body recognition. In this work, we adapt a ViT model pretrained on visible (VIS) imagery to the challenging problem of cross-spectral body recognition, which involves matching images captured in the visible and infrared (IR) domains. Recent ViT architectures have explored incorporating additional embeddings beyond traditional positional embeddings. Building on this idea, we integrate Side Information Embedding (SIE) and examine the impact of encoding domain and camera information to enhance cross-spectral matching. Surprisingly, our results show that encoding only camera information - without explicitly incorporating domain information - achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LLCM dataset. While occlusion handling has been extensively studied in visible-spectrum person re-identification (Re-ID), occlusions in visible-infrared (VI) Re-ID remain largely underexplored - primarily because existing VI-ReID datasets, such as LLCM, SYSU-MM01, and RegDB, predominantly feature full-body, unoccluded images. To address this gap, we analyze the impact of range-induced occlusions using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which provides a diverse set of visible and infrared images captured at various distances, enabling cross-range, cross-spectral evaluations.

<title>Segment Concealed Objects with Incomplete Supervision</title>

Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments, utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing the performance of existing models.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance improvement on the DOTA dataset.

Abstract: Object compositing, the task of placing and harmonizing objects in images of diverse visual scenes, has become an important task in computer vision with the rise of generative models. However, existing datasets lack the diversity and scale required to comprehensively explore real-world scenarios. We introduce ORIDa (Object-centric Real-world Image Composition Dataset), a large-scale, real-captured dataset containing over 30,000 images featuring 200 unique objects, each of which is presented across varied positions and scenes. ORIDa has two types of data: factual-counterfactual sets and factual-only scenes. The factual-counterfactual sets consist of four factual images showing an object in different positions within a scene and a single counterfactual (or background) image of the scene without the object, resulting in five images per scene. The factual-only scenes include a single image containing an object in a specific context, expanding the variety of environments. To our knowledge, ORIDa is the first publicly available dataset with its scale and complexity for real-world image composition. Extensive analysis and experiments highlight the value of ORIDa as a resource for advancing further research in object compositing.

Abstract: Object detection models typically rely on predefined categories, limiting their ability to identify novel objects in open-world scenarios. To overcome this constraint, we introduce ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model, a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene. These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

<title>Rethinking Range-View LiDAR Segmentation in Adverse Weather</title>

Abstract: LiDAR segmentation has emerged as an important task to enrich multimedia experiences and analysis. Range-view-based methods have gained popularity due to their high computational efficiency and compatibility with real-time deployment. However, their generalized performance under adverse weather conditions remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world environments. In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather. To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS) module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation pipeline. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks and baseline models demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization to adverse weather with minimal inference overhead, offering a practical and effective solution for real-world LiDAR segmentation.

<title>Efficient Medical Vision-Language Alignment Through Adapting Masked Vision Models</title>

Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/DopamineLcy/ALTA.

<title>Do Concept Replacement Techniques Really Erase Unacceptable Concepts?</title>

Abstract: Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models, have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to "erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity. We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.

<title>SDTagNet: Leveraging Text-Annotated Navigation Maps for Online HD Map Construction</title>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment. This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second, we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP (+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover, pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on popular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab

<title>DIsoN: Decentralized Isolation Networks for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test samples and the training data distribution to identify differences. State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound, histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of their training data for OOD detection services.

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.

Abstract: We introduce Princeton365, a large-scale diverse dataset of 365 videos with accurate camera pose. Our dataset bridges the gap between accuracy and data diversity in current SLAM benchmarks by introducing a novel ground truth collection framework that leverages calibration boards and a 360-camera. We collect indoor, outdoor, and object scanning videos with synchronized monocular and stereo RGB video outputs as well as IMU. We further propose a new scene scale-aware evaluation metric for SLAM based on the the optical flow induced by the camera pose estimation error. In contrast to the current metrics, our new metric allows for comparison between the performance of SLAM methods across scenes as opposed to existing metrics such as Average Trajectory Error (ATE), allowing researchers to analyze the failure modes of their methods. We also propose a challenging Novel View Synthesis benchmark that covers cases not covered by current NVS benchmarks, such as fully non-Lambertian scenes with 360-degree camera trajectories.

<title>Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09040</link>

Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.

Abstract: Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity, multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.

Abstract: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts. Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache) that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.

Abstract: We present a semi-supervised approach that disaggregates refugee statistics from administrative boundaries to 0.5-degree grid cells across 25 Sub-Saharan African countries. By integrating UNHCR's ProGres registration data with satellite-derived building footprints from Google Open Buildings and location coordinates from OpenStreetMap Populated Places, our label spreading algorithm creates spatially explicit refugee statistics at high granularity.This methodology achieves 92.9% average accuracy in placing over 10 million refugee observations into appropriate grid cells, enabling the identification of localized displacement patterns previously obscured in broader regional and national statistics. The resulting high-resolution dataset provides a foundation for a deeper understanding of displacement drivers.

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level transport provides essential structure information for the class-level knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

<title>Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization of Large Multimodal Models by Adversarial Negative Mining</title>

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

Abstract: This paper aims to retrieve proteins with similar structures and semantics from large-scale protein dataset, facilitating the functional interpretation of protein structures derived by structural determination methods like cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Motivated by the recent progress of vision-language models (VLMs), we propose a CLIP-style framework for aligning 3D protein structures with functional annotations using contrastive learning. For model training, we propose a large-scale dataset of approximately 200,000 protein-caption pairs with rich functional descriptors. We evaluate our model in both in-domain and more challenging cross-database retrieval on Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) dataset, respectively. In both cases, our approach demonstrates promising zero-shot retrieval performance, highlighting the potential of multimodal foundation models for structure-function understanding in protein biology.

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of soft tissue deformation is a critical factor for surgical robotics and medical training. In this paper, we introduce a novel physics-informed neural simulator that approximates soft tissue deformations in a realistic and real-time manner. Our framework integrates Kelvinlet-based priors into neural simulators, making it the first approach to leverage Kelvinlets for residual learning and regularization in data-driven soft tissue modeling. By incorporating large-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations of both linear and nonlinear soft tissue responses, our method improves neural network predictions across diverse architectures, enhancing accuracy and physical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate surgical maneuvers that simulate the use of standard laparoscopic tissue grasping tools with high fidelity. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented learning as a powerful and efficient strategy for real-time, physics-aware soft tissue simulation in surgical applications.

Abstract: A new extended version of the altiro3D C++ Library -- initially developed to get glass-free holographic displays starting from 2D images -- is here introduced aiming to deal with 3D video streams from either 2D webcam images or flat video files. These streams are processed in real-time to synthesize light-fields (in Native format) and feed realistic 3D experiences. The core function needed to recreate multiviews consists on the use of MiDaS Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which allows to extract a depth map from a single 2D image. Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing techniques are applied to improve the overall performance of the extended altiro3D Library. Thus, altiro3D can now treat standard images, video streams or screen portions of a Desktop where other apps may be also running (like web browsers, video chats, etc) and render them into 3D. To achieve the latter, a screen region need to be selected in order to feed the output directly into a light-field 3D device such as Looking Glass (LG) Portrait. In order to simplify the acquisition of a Desktop screen area by the user, a multi-platform Graphical User Interface has been also implemented.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work, we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions, effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Research in neuroscience and vision science relies heavily on careful measurements of animal subject's gaze direction. Rodents are the most widely studied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage and hardiness. Recently, video based eye trackers that use image processing techniques have become a popular option for gaze tracking because they are easy to use and are completely noninvasive. Although significant progress has been made in improving the accuracy and robustness of eye tracking algorithms, unfortunately, almost all of the techniques have focused on human eyes, which does not account for the unique characteristics of the rodent eye images, e.g., variability in eye parameters, abundance of surrounding hair, and their small size. To overcome these unique challenges, this work presents a flexible, robust, and highly accurate model for pupil and corneal reflection identification in rodent gaze determination that can be incrementally trained to account for variability in eye parameters encountered in the field. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a highly accurate and practical biomedical image segmentation based convolutional neural network architecture for pupil and corneal reflection identification in eye images. This new method, in conjunction with our automated infrared videobased eye recording system, offers the state of the art technology in eye tracking for neuroscience and vision science research for rodents.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming medicine, with generative AI models like ChatGPT reshaping perceptions of its potential. This study examines surgeons' awareness, expectations, and involvement with AI in surgery through comparative surveys conducted in 2021 and 2024. Two cross-sectional surveys were distributed globally in 2021 and 2024, the first before an IRCAD webinar and the second during the annual EAES meeting. The surveys assessed demographics, AI awareness, expectations, involvement, and ethics (2024 only). The surveys collected a total of 671 responses from 98 countries, 522 in 2021 and 149 in 2024. Awareness of AI courses rose from 14.5% in 2021 to 44.6% in 2024, while course attendance increased from 12.9% to 23%. Despite this, familiarity with foundational AI concepts remained limited. Expectations for AI's role shifted in 2024, with hospital management gaining relevance. Ethical concerns gained prominence, with 87.2% of 2024 participants emphasizing accountability and transparency. Infrastructure limitations remained the primary obstacle to implementation. Interdisciplinary collaboration and structured training were identified as critical for successful AI adoption. Optimism about AI's transformative potential remained high, with 79.9% of respondents believing AI would positively impact surgery and 96.6% willing to integrate AI into their clinical practice. Surgeons' perceptions of AI are evolving, driven by the rise of generative AI and advancements in surgical data science. While enthusiasm for integration is strong, knowledge gaps and infrastructural challenges persist. Addressing these through education, ethical frameworks, and infrastructure development is essential.

Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity. However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

Abstract: High-quality volumetric meshing from medical images is a key bottleneck for physics-based simulations in personalized medicine. For volumetric meshing of complex medical structures, recent studies have often utilized deep learning (DL)-based template deformation approaches to enable fast test-time generation with high spatial accuracy. However, these approaches still exhibit limitations, such as limited flexibility at high-curvature areas and unrealistic inter-part distances. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective snap-and-tune strategy that sequentially applies DL and test-time optimization, which combines fast initial shape fitting with more detailed sample-specific mesh corrections. Our method provides significant improvements in both spatial accuracy and mesh quality, while being fully automated and requiring no additional training labels. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility and usefulness of our newly generated meshes via solid mechanics simulations in two different software platforms. Our code is available at https://github.com/danpak94/Deep-Cardiac-Volumetric-Mesh.

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Understanding their kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$ larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos, outperforming existing methods significantly.

Abstract: Modeling the full properties of light, including both amplitude and phase, in 3D representations is crucial for advancing physically plausible rendering, particularly in holographic displays. To support these features, we propose a novel representation that optimizes 3D scenes without relying on intensity-based intermediaries. We reformulate 3D Gaussian splatting with complex-valued Gaussian primitives, expanding support for rendering with light waves. By leveraging RGBD multi-view images, our method directly optimizes complex-valued Gaussians as a 3D holographic scene representation. This eliminates the need for computationally expensive hologram re-optimization. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 30x-10,000x speed improvements while maintaining on-par image quality, representing a first step towards geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene representations.

Abstract: We introduce AdaAct, a novel optimization algorithm that adjusts learning rates according to activation variance. Our method enhances the stability of neuron outputs by incorporating neuron-wise adaptivity during the training process, which subsequently leads to better generalization -- a complementary approach to conventional activation regularization methods. Experimental results demonstrate AdaAct's competitive performance across standard image classification benchmarks. We evaluate AdaAct on CIFAR and ImageNet, comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, AdaAct effectively bridges the gap between the convergence speed of Adam and the strong generalization capabilities of SGD, all while maintaining competitive execution times. Code is available at https://github.com/hseung88/adaact.

<title>Boosting Gradient Leakage Attacks: Data Reconstruction in Realistic FL Settings</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy, at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate, several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however, contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak, which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need for more effective defense methods.

Abstract: While current AI illustration tools can generate high-quality images from text prompts, they rarely reveal the step-by-step procedure that human artists follow. We present SakugaFlow, a four-stage pipeline that pairs diffusion-based image generation with a large-language-model tutor. At each stage, novices receive real-time feedback on anatomy, perspective, and composition, revise any step non-linearly, and branch alternative versions. By exposing intermediate outputs and embedding pedagogical dialogue, SakugaFlow turns a black-box generator into a scaffolded learning environment that supports both creative exploration and skills acquisition.

Abstract: Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models. Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment evaluation.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization, existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both centralized and federated settings.

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) has become a core component in modern computer vision models. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to input length poses a significant computational bottleneck in real-time and resource constrained environments. We propose PnP-Nystra, a Nystr\"om based linear approximation of self-attention, developed as a plug-and-play (PnP) module that can be integrated into the pre-trained image and video restoration models without retraining. As a drop-in replacement for MHSA, PnP-Nystra enables efficient acceleration in various window-based transformer architectures, including SwinIR, Uformer, and RVRT. Our experiments across diverse image and video restoration tasks, including denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution, demonstrate that PnP-Nystra achieves a 2-4x speed-up on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU and a 2-5x speed-up on CPU inference. Despite these significant gains, the method incurs a maximum PSNR drop of only 1.5 dB across all evaluated tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate a linear attention functioning as a training-free substitute for MHSA in restoration models.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber (A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise, anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module, enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal cardiac assessment.

Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions, we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

Abstract: Accurate classification of second-trimester fetal ultrasound images remains challenging due to low image quality, high intra-class variability, and significant class imbalance. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful, biologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework that-unlike prior studies focused on only a handful of anatomical targets-simultaneously distinguishes 16 fetal structures. Drawing on the hierarchical, modular organization of biological vision systems, our model stacks two complementary branches (a "shallow" path for coarse, low-resolution cues and a "detailed" path for fine, high-resolution features), concatenating their outputs for final prediction. To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large number of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture. We trained and evaluated on 5,298 routinely acquired clinical images (annotated by three experts and reconciled via Dawid-Skene), reflecting real-world noise and variability rather than a "cleaned" dataset. Despite this complexity, our ensemble (EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss) identifies 90% of organs with accuracy > 0.75 and 75% of organs with accuracy > 0.85-performance competitive with more elaborate models applied to far fewer categories. These results demonstrate that biologically inspired modular stacking can yield robust, scalable fetal anatomy recognition in challenging clinical settings.

Abstract: In this article, we present a novel multimodal feedback framework called MOSAIC-F, an acronym for a data-driven Framework that integrates Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student learning activities. This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI, synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others. Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and actionable feedback. We tested MOSAIC-F in the context of improving oral presentation skills.

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support, refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons, and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models, including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning: even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to 77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3 and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness. We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning. Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements, suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.

<title>Enhancing Synthetic CT from CBCT via Multimodal Fusion: A Study on the Impact of CBCT Quality and Alignment</title>

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for real-time intraoperative imaging due to its low radiation dose and high acquisition speed. However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.

<title>Normalized Radon Cumulative Distribution Transforms for Invariance and Robustness in Optimal Transport Based Image Classification</title>

Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute feature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the small data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and provably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from translations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine transformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this issue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only requires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary affine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the max-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against non-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its separability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance between the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance only allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a mean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the Wasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive noise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well as their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.

Abstract: Selection is the first step in many image editing processes, enabling faster and simpler modifications of all pixels sharing a common modality. In this work, we present a method for material selection in images, robust to lighting and reflectance variations, which can be used for downstream editing tasks. We rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for selection, proposing a multi-resolution processing strategy that yields finer and more stable selection results than prior methods. Furthermore, we enable selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over 800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: We present a lightweight system for stereo matching through embedded GPUs. It breaks the trade-off between accuracy and processing speed in stereo matching, enabling our embedded system to further improve the matching accuracy while ensuring real-time processing. The main idea of our method is to construct a tiny neural network based on variational auto-encoder (VAE) to upsample and refinement a small size of coarse disparity map, which is first generated by a traditional matching method. The proposed hybrid structure cannot only bring the advantage of traditional methods in terms of computational complexity, but also ensure the matching accuracy under the impact of neural network. Extensive experiments on the KITTI 2015 benchmark demonstrate that our tiny system exhibits high robustness in improving the accuracy of the coarse disparity maps generated by different algorithms, while also running in real-time on embedded GPUs.

Abstract: Viewport prediction is a crucial aspect of tile-based 360 video streaming system. However, existing trajectory based methods lack of robustness, also oversimplify the process of information construction and fusion between different modality inputs, leading to the error accumulation problem. In this paper, we propose a tile classification based viewport prediction method with Multi-modal Fusion Transformer, namely MFTR. Specifically, MFTR utilizes transformer-based networks to extract the long-range dependencies within each modality, then mine intra- and inter-modality relations to capture the combined impact of user historical inputs and video contents on future viewport selection. In addition, MFTR categorizes future tiles into two categories: user interested or not, and selects future viewport as the region that contains most user interested tiles. Comparing with predicting head trajectories, choosing future viewport based on tile's binary classification results exhibits better robustness and interpretability. To evaluate our proposed MFTR, we conduct extensive experiments on two widely used PVS-HM and Xu-Gaze dataset. MFTR shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of average prediction accuracy and overlap ratio, also presents competitive computation efficiency.

Abstract: Masked autoencoding and generative pretraining have achieved remarkable success in computer vision and natural language processing, and more recently, they have been extended to the point cloud domain. Nevertheless, existing point cloud models suffer from the issue of information leakage due to the pre-sampling of center points, which leads to trivial proxy tasks for the models. These approaches primarily focus on local feature reconstruction, limiting their ability to capture global patterns within point clouds. In this paper, we argue that the reduced difficulty of pretext tasks hampers the model's capacity to learn expressive representations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel solution called the Differentiable Center Sampling Network (DCS-Net). It tackles the information leakage problem by incorporating both global feature reconstruction and local feature reconstruction as non-trivial proxy tasks, enabling simultaneous learning of both the global and local patterns within point cloud. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the expressive capacity of existing point cloud models and effectively addresses the issue of information leakage.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task of predicting the answer to a question about the content of an image. Prior works directly evaluate the answering models by simply calculating the accuracy of predicted answers. However, the inner reasoning behind the predictions is disregarded in such a "black box" system, and we cannot ascertain the trustworthiness of the predictions. Even more concerning, in some cases, these models predict correct answers despite focusing on irrelevant visual regions or textual tokens. To develop an explainable and trustworthy answering system, we propose a novel model termed MRVQA (Multimodal Rationales for VQA), which provides visual and textual rationales to support its predicted answers. To measure the quality of generated rationales, a new metric vtS (visual-textual Similarity) score is introduced from both visual and textual perspectives. Considering the extra annotations distinct from standard VQA, MRVQA is trained and evaluated using samples synthesized from some existing datasets. Extensive experiments across three EVQA datasets demonstrate that MRVQA achieves new state-of-the-art results through additional rationale generation, enhancing the trustworthiness of the explainable VQA model. The code and the synthesized dataset are released under https://github.com/lik1996/MRVQA2025.

<title>Multimodal Unsupervised Domain Generalization by Retrieving Across the Modality Gap</title>

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) is an important problem that learns a model which generalizes to unseen test domains leveraging one or more source domains, under the assumption of shared label spaces. However, most DG methods assume access to abundant source data in the target label space, a requirement that proves overly stringent for numerous real-world applications, where acquiring the same label space as the target task is prohibitively expensive. For this setting, we tackle the multimodal version of the unsupervised domain generalization (MUDG) problem, which uses a large task-agnostic unlabeled source dataset during finetuning. Our framework does not explicitly assume any relationship between the source dataset and target task. Instead, it relies only on the premise that the source dataset can be accurately and efficiently searched in a joint vision-language space. We make three contributions in the MUDG setting. Firstly, we show theoretically that cross-modal approximate nearest neighbor search suffers from low recall due to the large distance between text queries and the image centroids used for coarse quantization. Accordingly, we propose paired k-means, a simple clustering algorithm that improves nearest neighbor recall by storing centroids in query space instead of image space. Secondly, we propose an adaptive text augmentation scheme for target labels designed to improve zero-shot accuracy and diversify retrieved image data. Lastly, we present two simple but effective components to further improve downstream target accuracy. We compare against state-of-the-art name-only transfer, source-free DG and zero-shot (ZS) methods on their respective benchmarks and show consistent improvement in accuracy on 20 diverse datasets. Code is available: https://github.com/Chris210634/mudg

Abstract: Motion style transfer is a significant research direction in the field of computer vision, enabling virtual digital humans to rapidly switch between different styles of the same motion, thereby significantly enhancing the richness and realism of movements. It has been widely applied in multimedia scenarios such as films, games, and the metaverse. However, most existing methods adopt a two-stream structure, which tends to overlook the intrinsic relationship between content and style motions, leading to information loss and poor alignment. Moreover, when handling long-range motion sequences, these methods fail to effectively learn temporal dependencies, ultimately resulting in unnatural generated motions. To address these limitations, we propose a Unified Motion Style Diffusion (UMSD) framework, which simultaneously extracts features from both content and style motions and facilitates sufficient information interaction. Additionally, we introduce the Motion Style Mamba (MSM) denoiser, the first approach in the field of motion style transfer to leverage Mamba's powerful sequence modelling capability. Better capturing temporal relationships generates more coherent stylized motion sequences. Third, we design a diffusion-based content consistency loss and a style consistency loss to constrain the framework, ensuring that it inherits the content motion while effectively learning the characteristics of the style motion. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods qualitatively and quantitatively, achieving more realistic and coherent motion style transfer.

Abstract: Current medical AI systems are often limited to narrow applications, hindering widespread adoption. We present MedVersa, a generalist foundation model trained on tens of millions of compiled medical instances. MedVersa unlocks generalist learning from multimodal inputs and outputs, representing the first example of a generalist model reaching competitive performance with leading specialized solutions across a variety of medical imaging scenarios. MedVersa achieves state-of-the-art performance in nine tasks, sometimes outperforming counterparts by over 10%. Radiologist evaluation shows MedVersa-generated reports get superior performance in 95% of normal studies, while matching or exceeding human reports in 71% of cases overall. User studies showed notable reductions in report writing time and discrepancies with the use of MedVersa. Our findings underscore the value of flexible, multimodal AI systems in advancing medical image interpretation and supporting clinical expertise.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation involves reconstructing the human skeleton by detecting the body joints. Accurate and efficient solutions are required for several real-world applications including animation, human-robot interaction, surveillance, and sports. However, challenges such as occlusions, 2D pose mismatches, random camera perspectives, and limited 3D labelled data have been hampering the models' performance and limiting their deployment in real-world scenarios. The higher availability of cameras has led researchers to explore multi-view solutions to take advantage of the different perspectives to reconstruct the pose.
  Most existing reviews have mainly focused on monocular 3D human pose estimation, so a comprehensive survey on multi-view approaches has been missing since 2012. According to the reviewed articles, the majority of the existing methods are fully-supervised approaches based on geometric constraints, which are often limited by 2D pose mismatches. To mitigate this, researchers have proposed incorporating temporal consistency or depth information. Alternatively, working directly with 3D features has been shown to completely overcome this issue, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity. Additionally, models with lower levels of supervision have been identified to help address challenges such as annotated data scarcity and generalisation to new setups. Therefore, no method currently addresses all challenges associated with 3D pose reconstruction, and a trade-off between complexity and performance exists. Further research is needed to develop approaches capable of quickly inferring a highly accurate 3D pose with bearable computation cost. Techniques such as active learning, low-supervision methods, temporal consistency, view selection, depth information estimation, and multi-modal approaches are strategies to consider when developing a new method for this task.

Abstract: Early detection of drought stress is critical for taking timely measures for reducing crop loss before the drought impact becomes irreversible. The subtle phenotypical and physiological changes in response to drought stress are captured by non-invasive imaging techniques and these imaging data serve as valuable resource for machine learning methods to identify drought stress. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are in wide use, vision transformers (ViTs) present a promising alternative in capturing long-range dependencies and intricate spatial relationships, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle indicators of drought stress. We propose an explainable deep learning pipeline that leverages the power of ViTs for drought stress detection in potato crops using aerial imagery. We applied two distinct approaches: a synergistic combination of ViT and support vector machine (SVM), where ViT extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy and an end-to-end approach using a dedicated classification layer within ViT to directly detect drought stress. Our key findings explain the ViT model's decision-making process by visualizing attention maps. These maps highlight the specific spatial features within the aerial images that the ViT model focuses as the drought stress signature. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed methods not only achieve high accuracy in drought stress identification but also shedding light on the diverse subtle plant features associated with drought stress. This offers a robust and interpretable solution for drought stress monitoring for farmers to undertake informed decisions for improved crop management.

Abstract: Reducing speckle fluctuations in multi-channel SAR images is essential in many applications of SAR imaging such as polarimetric classification or interferometric height estimation. While single-channel despeckling has widely benefited from the application of deep learning techniques, extensions to multi-channel SAR images are much more challenging. This paper introduces MuChaPro, a generic framework that exploits existing single-channel despeckling methods. The key idea is to generate numerous single-channel projections, restore these projections, and recombine them into the final multi-channel estimate. This simple approach is shown to be effective in polarimetric and/or interferometric modalities. A special appeal of MuChaPro is the possibility to apply a self-supervised training strategy to learn sensor-specific networks for single-channel despeckling.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their parameter-intensive nature and reliance on large amounts of data for effective performance have shifted the focus from traditional human-annotated labels to unsupervised learning and pretraining strategies that uncover hidden structures within the data. In response to this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm. SSL leverages inherent relationships within the data itself as a form of supervision, eliminating the need for manual labeling and offering a more scalable and resource-efficient alternative for model training. Given these advantages, it is imperative to explore the integration of SSL techniques with ViTs, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Inspired by this evolving trend, this survey aims to systematically review SSL mechanisms tailored for ViTs. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy to classify SSL techniques based on their representations and pre-training tasks. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind SSL, review prominent pre-training tasks, and highlight advancements and challenges in this field. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various SSL methods designed for ViTs, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and applicability to different scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks that evaluate complex visio-linguistic reasoning. However, are these models truly effective? In this work, we show that VLMs still struggle with natural images and questions that humans can easily answer, which we term natural adversarial samples. We also find it surprisingly easy to generate these VQA samples from natural image-text corpora using off-the-shelf models like CLIP and ChatGPT. We propose a semi-automated approach to collect a new benchmark, NaturalBench, for reliably evaluating VLMs with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples. Crucially, we adopt a $\textbf{vision-centric}$ design by pairing each question with two images that yield different answers, preventing blind solutions from answering without using the images. This makes NaturalBench more challenging than previous benchmarks that can be solved with commonsense priors. We evaluate 53 state-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench, showing that models like LLaVA-OneVision, Cambrian-1, Llama3.2-Vision, Molmo, Qwen2-VL, and even GPT-4o lag 50%-70% behind human performance (over 90%). We analyze why NaturalBench is hard from two angles: (1) Compositionality: Solving NaturalBench requires diverse visio-linguistic skills, including understanding attribute bindings, object relationships, and advanced reasoning like logic and counting. To this end, unlike prior work that uses a single tag per sample, we tag each NaturalBench sample with 1 to 8 skill tags for fine-grained evaluation. (2) Biases: NaturalBench exposes severe biases in VLMs, as models often choose the same answer regardless of the image. Lastly, we apply our benchmark curation method to diverse data sources, including long captions (over 100 words) and non-English languages like Chinese and Hindi, highlighting its potential for dynamic evaluations of VLMs.

Abstract: Video generation models have made significant progress in simulating future states, showcasing their potential as world simulators in embodied scenarios. However, existing models often lack robust understanding, limiting their ability to perform multi-step predictions or handle Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose the Reflection of Generation (RoG), a set of intermediate reasoning strategies designed to enhance video prediction. It leverages the complementary strengths of pre-trained vision-language and video generation models, enabling them to function as a world model in embodied scenarios. To support RoG, we introduce Embodied Video Anticipation Benchmark(EVA-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates embodied world models across diverse tasks and scenarios, utilizing both in-domain and OOD datasets. Building on this foundation, we devise a world model, Embodied Video Anticipator (EVA), that follows a multistage training paradigm to generate high-fidelity video frames and apply an autoregressive strategy to enable adaptive generalization for longer video sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of EVA in various downstream tasks like video generation and robotics, thereby paving the way for large-scale pre-trained models in real-world video prediction applications.

Abstract: We present xGen-MM-Vid (BLIP-3-Video): a multimodal language model for videos, particularly designed to efficiently capture temporal information over multiple frames. BLIP-3-Video takes advantage of the 'temporal encoder' in addition to the conventional visual tokenizer, which maps a sequence of tokens over multiple frames into a compact set of visual tokens. This enables BLIP3-Video to use much fewer visual tokens than its competing models (e.g., 32 vs. 4608 tokens). We explore different types of temporal encoders, including learnable spatio-temporal pooling as well as sequential models like Token Turing Machines. We experimentally confirm that BLIP-3-Video obtains video question-answering accuracies comparable to much larger state-of-the-art models (e.g., 34B), while being much smaller (i.e., 4B) and more efficient by using fewer visual tokens.

Abstract: We propose UnCLe, the first standardized benchmark for Unsupervised Continual Learning of a multimodal 3D reconstruction task: Depth completion aims to infer a dense depth map from a pair of synchronized RGB image and sparse depth map. We benchmark depth completion models under the practical scenario of unsupervised learning over continuous streams of data. While unsupervised learning of depth boasts the possibility continual learning of novel data distributions over time, existing methods are typically trained on a static, or stationary, dataset. However, when adapting to novel nonstationary distributions, they ``catastrophically forget'' previously learned information. UnCLe simulates these non-stationary distributions by adapting depth completion models to sequences of datasets containing diverse scenes captured from distinct domains using different visual and range sensors. We adopt representative methods from continual learning paradigms and translate them to enable unsupervised continual learning of depth completion. We benchmark these models across indoor and outdoor environments, and investigate the degree of catastrophic forgetting through standard quantitative metrics. We find that unsupervised continual learning of depth completion is an open problem, and we invite researchers to leverage UnCLe as a development platform.

Abstract: Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aims to discover objects in images or videos by reconstructing the input. Representative methods achieve this by reconstructing the input as its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) discrete representations, which suppress (super-)pixel noise and enhance object separability. However, these methods treat features as indivisible units, overlooking their compositional attributes, and discretize features via scalar code indexes, losing attribute-level similarities and differences. We propose Grouped Discrete Representation (GDR) for OCL. For better generalization, features are decomposed into combinatorial attributes by organized channel grouping. For better convergence, features are quantized into discrete representations via tuple code indexes. Experiments demonstrate that GDR consistently improves both mainstream and state-of-the-art OCL methods across various datasets. Visualizations further highlight GDR's superior object separability and interpretability. The source code is available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/GroupedDiscreteRepresentation.

Abstract: One of the key challenges of detecting AI-generated images is spotting images that have been created by previously unseen generative models. We argue that the limited diversity of the training data is a major obstacle to addressing this problem, and we propose a new dataset that is significantly larger and more diverse than prior work. As part of creating this dataset, we systematically download thousands of text-to-image latent diffusion models and sample images from them. We also collect images from dozens of popular open source and commercial models. The resulting dataset contains 2.7M images that have been sampled from 4803 different models. These images collectively capture a wide range of scene content, generator architectures, and image processing settings. Using this dataset, we study the generalization abilities of fake image detectors. Our experiments suggest that detection performance improves as the number of models in the training set increases, even when these models have similar architectures. We also find that detection performance improves as the diversity of the models increases, and that our trained detectors generalize better than those trained on other datasets. The dataset can be found in https://jespark.net/projects/2024/community_forensics

<title>Autonomous Imagination: Closed-Loop Decomposition of Visual-to-Textual Conversion in Visual Reasoning for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Under pure textual modality, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks by decomposing them into simpler sub-problems. However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still struggle with some seemingly straightforward visual tasks, such as counting and solving jigsaw puzzles. We argue that these tasks challenge the ability of visual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceived from the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning and generating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond the perceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversion process, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task because it repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose an approach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visual inputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediate visual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visual modification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solve tasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting that closed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing the visual reasoning task into solvable substeps.

Abstract: We have witnessed the unprecedented success of diffusion-based video generation over the past year. Recently proposed models from the community have wielded the power to generate cinematic and high-resolution videos with smooth motions from arbitrary input prompts. However, as a supertask of image generation, video generation models require more computation and are thus hosted mostly on cloud servers, limiting broader adoption among content creators. In this work, we propose a comprehensive acceleration framework to bring the power of the large-scale video diffusion model to the hands of edge users. From the network architecture scope, we initialize from a compact image backbone and search out the design and arrangement of temporal layers to maximize hardware efficiency. In addition, we propose a dedicated adversarial fine-tuning algorithm for our efficient model and reduce the denoising steps to 4. Our model, with only 0.6B parameters, can generate a 5-second video on an iPhone 16 PM within 5 seconds. Compared to server-side models that take minutes on powerful GPUs to generate a single video, we accelerate the generation by magnitudes while delivering on-par quality.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in surveillance and security. Despite progress in recent years, most existing ReID models often struggle to generalize across diverse cultural contexts, particularly in Islamic regions like Iran, where modest clothing styles are prevalent. Existing datasets predominantly feature Western and East Asian fashion, limiting their applicability in these settings. To address this gap, we introduce Iran University of Science and Technology Person Re-Identification (IUST_PersonReId), a dataset designed to reflect the unique challenges of ReID in new cultural environments, emphasizing modest attire and diverse scenarios from Iran, including markets, campuses, and mosques. Experiments on IUST_PersonReId with state-of-the-art models, such as Semantic Controllable Self-supervised Learning (SOLIDER) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining Re-Identification (CLIP-ReID), reveal significant performance drops compared to benchmarks like Market1501 and Multi-Scene MultiTime (MSMT17), specifically, SOLIDER shows a drop of 50.75% and 23.01% Mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to Market1501 and MSMT17 respectively, while CLIP-ReID exhibits a drop of 38.09% and 21.74% mAP, highlighting the challenges posed by occlusion and limited distinctive features. Sequence-based evaluations show improvements by leveraging temporal context, emphasizing the dataset's potential for advancing culturally sensitive and robust ReID systems. IUST_PersonReId offers a critical resource for addressing fairness and bias in ReID research globally.

Abstract: Video behavior recognition and scene understanding are fundamental tasks in multimodal intelligence, serving as critical building blocks for numerous real-world applications. Through large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding, most existing open-source models rely on over 7B parameters and require large-scale datasets for training, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible to many researchers. Furthermore, lightweight models face persistent challenges in effectively processing long visual sequences and temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce TinyLLaVA-Video, a lightweight yet powerful video understanding model with approximately 3.6B parameters. The cornerstone of our design is the video-level group resampler, a novel mechanism that significantly reduces and controls the number of visual tokens at the video level. Unlike traditional image-level resampler, our approach effectively mitigates redundancy while enhancing temporal comprehension, leading to improved performance on video-based tasks. In addition, TinyLLaVA-Video demonstrates exceptional efficiency, requiring only one day of training on 8 A100-40G GPUs. It surpasses several existing 7B-parameter models on multiple benchmarks. We believe this work provides a valuable foundation for future research on lightweight video understanding models. The code and weights is available at https://github.com/ZhangXJ199/TinyLLaVA-Video.

Abstract: Decoding visual images from brain activity has significant potential for advancing brain-computer interaction and enhancing the understanding of human perception. Recent approaches align the representation spaces of images and brain activity to enable visual decoding. In this paper, we introduce the use of human-aligned image encoders to map brain signals to images. We hypothesize that these models more effectively capture perceptual attributes associated with the rapid visual stimuli presentations commonly used in visual brain data recording experiments. Our empirical results support this hypothesis, demonstrating that this simple modification improves image retrieval accuracy by up to 21% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive experiments confirm consistent performance improvements across diverse EEG architectures, image encoders, alignment methods, participants, and brain imaging modalities

Abstract: In this work, we propose a modular approach for the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) task by decomposing the problem into four sub-modules that use state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in a zero-shot setting. Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches that use joint semantic maps like VLMaps on the complex R2R-Habitat instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of visual grounding on navigation performance.

Abstract: Retrieving images from the same location as a given query is an important component of multiple computer vision tasks, like Visual Place Recognition, Landmark Retrieval, Visual Localization, 3D reconstruction, and SLAM. However, existing solutions are built to specifically work for one of these tasks, and are known to fail when the requirements slightly change or when they meet out-of-distribution data. In this paper we combine a variety of existing methods, training techniques, and datasets to train a retrieval model, called MegaLoc, that is performant on multiple tasks. We find that MegaLoc (1) achieves state of the art on a large number of Visual Place Recognition datasets, (2) impressive results on common Landmark Retrieval datasets, and (3) sets a new state of the art for Visual Localization on the LaMAR datasets, where we only changed the retrieval method to the existing localization pipeline. The code for MegaLoc is available at https://github.com/gmberton/MegaLoc

Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative technique for representing multidimensional datasets using icons inspired by Chernoff faces. Our approach combines classical projection techniques with the explicit assignment of selected data dimensions to avatar (facial) features, leveraging the innate human ability to interpret facial traits. We introduce a semantic division of data dimensions into intuitive and technical categories, assigning the former to avatar features and projecting the latter into a four-dimensional (or higher) spatial embedding. The technique is implemented as a plugin for the open-source dpVision visualization platform, enabling users to interactively explore data in the form of a swarm of avatars whose spatial positions and visual features jointly encode various aspects of the dataset. Experimental results with synthetic test data and a 12-dimensional dataset of Portuguese Vinho Verde wines demonstrate that the proposed method enhances interpretability and facilitates the analysis of complex data structures.

Abstract: Reconstructing spatially and temporally coherent videos from time-varying measurements is a fundamental challenge in many scientific domains. A major difficulty arises from the sparsity of measurements, which hinders accurate recovery of temporal dynamics. Existing image diffusion-based methods rely on extracting temporal consistency directly from measurements, limiting their effectiveness on scientific tasks with high spatiotemporal uncertainty. We address this difficulty by proposing a plug-and-play framework that incorporates a learned spatiotemporal diffusion prior. Due to its plug-and-play nature, our framework can be flexibly applied to different video inverse problems without the need for task-specific design and temporal heuristics. We further demonstrate that a spatiotemporal diffusion model can be trained efficiently with limited video data. We validate our approach on two challenging scientific video reconstruction tasks: black hole video reconstruction and dynamic MRI. While baseline methods struggle to provide temporally coherent reconstructions, our approach achieves significantly improved recovery of the spatiotemporal structure of the underlying ground truth videos.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling unified modeling of static infrastructure and dynamic agents. In practice, autonomous vehicles may repeatedly traverse identical geographic locations under varying environmental conditions, such as weather fluctuations and illumination changes. Existing methods in 3D occupancy prediction predominantly integrate adjacent temporal contexts. However, these works neglect to leverage perceptual information, which is acquired from historical traversals of identical geographic locations. In this paper, we propose Longterm Memory Prior Occupancy (LMPOcc), the first 3D occupancy prediction methodology that exploits long-term memory priors derived from historical traversal perceptual outputs. We introduce a plug-and-play architecture that integrates long-term memory priors to enhance local perception while simultaneously constructing global occupancy representations. To adaptively aggregate prior features and current features, we develop an efficient lightweight Current-Prior Fusion module. Moreover, we propose a model-agnostic prior format to ensure compatibility across diverse occupancy prediction baselines. LMPOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance validated on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, especially on static semantic categories. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate LMPOcc's ability to construct global occupancy through multi-vehicle crowdsourcing.

Abstract: The field of monocular depth estimation is continually evolving with the advent of numerous innovative models and extensions. However, research on monocular depth estimation methods specifically for underwater scenes remains limited, compounded by a scarcity of relevant data and methodological support. This paper proposes a novel approach to address the existing challenges in current monocular depth estimation methods for underwater environments. We construct an economically efficient dataset suitable for underwater scenarios by employing multi-view depth estimation to generate supervisory signals and corresponding enhanced underwater images. we introduces a texture-depth fusion module, designed according to the underwater optical imaging principles, which aims to effectively exploit and integrate depth information from texture cues. Experimental results on the FLSea dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of models in underwater settings. This work offers a cost-effective solution for monocular underwater depth estimation and holds considerable promise for practical applications.

Abstract: Despite recent advances on multi-modal models, 3D spatial reasoning remains a challenging task for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models. Recent studies explore data-driven approaches and achieve enhanced spatial reasoning performance by fine-tuning models on 3D-related visual question-answering data. However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit manner and often fail on questions that are trivial to humans, even with long chain-of-thought reasoning. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that addresses 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between multiple stages--3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and improves the generalization ability to novel question types. Furthermore, by analyzing the explicit 3D representations in multi-step reasoning traces of SpatialReasoner, we study the factual errors and identify key shortcomings of current LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieves improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks, outperforming Gemini 2.0 by 9.2% on 3DSRBench, and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Humans naturally understand 3D spatial relationships, enabling complex reasoning like predicting collisions of vehicles from different directions. Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%. Our systematic empirical design and the resulting findings offer valuable insights for future research in this direction.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success, prompting increased interest in expanding their generative capabilities beyond general text into domain-specific areas. This study investigates the generation of parametric sequences for computer-aided design (CAD) models using LLMs. This endeavor represents an initial step towards creating parametric 3D shapes with LLMs, as CAD model parameters directly correlate with shapes in three-dimensional space. Despite the formidable generative capacities of LLMs, this task remains challenging, as these models neither encounter parametric sequences during their pretraining phase nor possess direct awareness of 3D structures. To address this, we present CAD-Llama, a framework designed to enhance pretrained LLMs for generating parametric 3D CAD models. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical annotation pipeline and a code-like format to translate parametric 3D CAD command sequences into Structured Parametric CAD Code (SPCC), incorporating hierarchical semantic descriptions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive pretraining approach utilizing SPCC, followed by an instruction tuning process aligned with CAD-specific guidelines. This methodology aims to equip LLMs with the spatial knowledge inherent in parametric sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms prior autoregressive methods and existing LLM baselines.

Abstract: Utilizing pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models to guide Blind Super-Resolution (BSR) has become a predominant approach in the field. While T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors. Our experiments demonstrate that EAM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in volumetric medical images is crucial for clinical applications, including disease monitoring and cancer treatment planning. Contemporary interactive segmentation models, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) and its medical variant (MedSAM-2), rely on manually provided prompts like bounding boxes and mouse clicks. In this study, we introduce eye gaze as a novel informational modality for interactive segmentation, marking the application of eye-tracking for 3D medical image segmentation. We evaluate the performance of using gaze-based prompts with SAM-2 and MedSAM-2 using both synthetic and real gaze data. Compared to bounding boxes, gaze-based prompts offer a time-efficient interaction approach with slightly lower segmentation quality. Our findings highlight the potential of using gaze as a complementary input modality for interactive 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore, we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image generation.

<title>How Do Images Align and Complement LiDAR? Towards a Harmonized Multi-modal 3D Panoptic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D panoptic segmentation often struggles with the inherent sparsity of data from LiDAR sensors, which makes it challenging to accurately recognize distant or small objects. Recently, a few studies have sought to overcome this challenge by integrating LiDAR inputs with camera images, leveraging the rich and dense texture information provided by the latter. While these approaches have shown promising results, they still face challenges, such as misalignment during data augmentation and the reliance on post-processing steps. To address these issues, we propose Image-Assists-LiDAR (IAL), a novel multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation framework. In IAL, we first introduce a modality-synchronized data augmentation strategy, PieAug, to ensure alignment between LiDAR and image inputs from the start. Next, we adopt a transformer decoder to directly predict panoptic segmentation results. To effectively fuse LiDAR and image features into tokens for the decoder, we design a Geometric-guided Token Fusion (GTF) module. Additionally, we leverage the complementary strengths of each modality as priors for query initialization through a Prior-based Query Generation (PQG) module, enhancing the decoder's ability to generate accurate instance masks. Our IAL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation methods on two widely used benchmarks. Code and models are publicly available at .

Abstract: State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.

Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, hand-relatedness, elongation) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.

<title>Revisiting Reweighted Risk for Calibration: AURC, Focal Loss, and Inverse Focal Loss</title>

Abstract: Several variants of reweighted risk functionals, such as focal losss, inverse focal loss, and the Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC), have been proposed in the literature and claims have been made in relation to their calibration properties. However, focal loss and inverse focal loss propose vastly different weighting schemes. In this paper, we revisit a broad class of weighted risk functions commonly used in deep learning and establish a principled connection between these reweighting schemes and calibration errors. We show that minimizing calibration error is closely linked to the selective classification paradigm and demonstrate that optimizing a regularized variant of the AURC naturally leads to improved calibration. This regularized AURC shares a similar reweighting strategy with inverse focal loss, lending support to the idea that focal loss is less principled when calibration is a desired outcome. Direct AURC optimization offers greater flexibility through the choice of confidence score functions (CSFs). To enable gradient-based optimization, we introduce a differentiable formulation of the regularized AURC using the SoftRank technique. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our AURC-based loss achieves competitive class-wise calibration performance across a range of datasets and model architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive "fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Populist rhetoric employed on online media is characterized as deeply impassioned and often imbued with strong emotions. The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the differences in affective nonverbal communication of political leaders. We use a deep-learning approach to process a sample of 220 YouTube videos of political leaders from 15 different countries, analyze their facial expressions of emotion and then examine differences in average emotion scores representing the relative presence of 6 emotional states (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and a neutral expression for each frame of the YouTube video. Based on a sample of manually coded images, we find that this deep-learning approach has 53-60\% agreement with human labels. We observe statistically significant differences in the average score of negative emotions between groups of leaders with varying degrees of populist rhetoric.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval augmented generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in domains such as knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA), where external knowledge is needed to answer a question. However, existing multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are not designed for context-augmented generation, limiting their effectiveness in such tasks. While synthetic data generation has recently gained attention for training MLLMs, its application for context-augmented generation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce SK-VQA, a large-scale synthetic multimodal dataset containing over 2 million visual question-answer pairs, each associated with context documents containing information necessary to determine the final answer. Compared to previous datasets, SK-VQA contains 11x more unique questions, exhibits greater domain diversity, and covers a broader spectrum of image sources. Through human evaluations, we confirm the high quality of the generated question-answer pairs and their contextual relevance. Extensive experiments show that SK-VQA serves both as a challenging KB-VQA benchmark and as an effective training resource for adapting MLLMs to context-augmented generation. Our results further indicate that models trained on SK-VQA demonstrate enhanced generalization in both context-aware VQA and multimodal RAG settings. SK-VQA is publicly available via Hugging Face Hub.

Abstract: Understanding how humans conceptualize and categorize natural objects offers critical insights into perception and cognition. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), a key question arises: can these models develop human-like object representations from linguistic and multimodal data? In this study, we combined behavioral and neuroimaging analyses to explore the relationship between object concept representations in LLMs and human cognition. We collected 4.7 million triplet judgments from LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were stable, predictive, and exhibited semantic clustering similar to human mental representations. Remarkably, the dimensions underlying these embeddings were interpretable, suggesting that LLMs and MLLMs develop human-like conceptual representations of objects. Further analysis showed strong alignment between model embeddings and neural activity patterns in brain regions such as EBA, PPA, RSC, and FFA. This provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not identical to human ones, share fundamental similarities that reflect key aspects of human conceptual knowledge. Our findings advance the understanding of machine intelligence and inform the development of more human-like artificial cognitive systems.

Abstract: We propose a simple, training-free mechanism which explains the generalization behaviour of diffusion models. By comparing pre-trained diffusion models to their theoretically optimal empirical counterparts, we identify a shared local inductive bias across a variety of network architectures. From this observation, we hypothesize that network denoisers generalize through localized denoising operations, as these operations approximate the training objective well over much of the training distribution. To validate our hypothesis, we introduce novel denoising algorithms which aggregate local empirical denoisers to replicate network behaviour. Comparing these algorithms to network denoisers across forward and reverse diffusion processes, our approach exhibits consistent visual similarity to neural network outputs, with lower mean squared error than previously proposed methods.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress in integrating large language models (LLMs) with visual inputs, enabling advanced multimodal reasoning. Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Vision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate hallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining high efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.

Abstract: Tracking and mapping in large-scale, unbounded outdoor environments using only monocular RGB input presents substantial challenges for existing SLAM systems. Traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM methods are typically limited to small, bounded indoor settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GigaSLAM, the first RGB NeRF / 3DGS-based SLAM framework for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, as demonstrated on the KITTI, KITTI 360, 4 Seasons and A2D2 datasets. Our approach employs a hierarchical sparse voxel map representation, where Gaussians are decoded by neural networks at multiple levels of detail. This design enables efficient, scalable mapping and high-fidelity viewpoint rendering across expansive, unbounded scenes. For front-end tracking, GigaSLAM utilizes a metric depth model combined with epipolar geometry and PnP algorithms to accurately estimate poses, while incorporating a Bag-of-Words-based loop closure mechanism to maintain robust alignment over long trajectories. Consequently, GigaSLAM delivers high-precision tracking and visually faithful rendering on urban outdoor benchmarks, establishing a robust SLAM solution for large-scale, long-term scenarios, and significantly extending the applicability of Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems to unbounded outdoor environments.

Abstract: How well can one expect transfer learning to work in a new setting where the domain is shifted, the task is different, and the architecture changes? Many transfer learning metrics have been proposed to answer this question. But how accurate are their predictions in a realistic new setting? We conducted an extensive evaluation involving over 42,000 experiments comparing 23 transferability metrics across 16 different datasets to assess their ability to predict transfer performance. Our findings reveal that none of the existing metrics perform well across the board. However, we find that a simple k-nearest neighbor evaluation -- as is commonly used to evaluate feature quality for self-supervision -- not only surpasses existing metrics, but also offers better computational efficiency and ease of implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive path planner for object search in agricultural fields using UAVs. The path planner uses a high-altitude coverage flight path and plans additional low-altitude inspections when the detection network is uncertain. The path planner was evaluated in an offline simulation environment containing real-world images. We trained a YOLOv8 detection network to detect artificial plants placed in grass fields to showcase the potential of our path planner. We evaluated the effect of different detection certainty measures, optimized the path planning parameters, investigated the effects of localization errors, and different numbers of objects in the field. The YOLOv8 detection confidence worked best to differentiate between true and false positive detections and was therefore used in the adaptive planner. The optimal parameters of the path planner depended on the distribution of objects in the field. When the objects were uniformly distributed, more low-altitude inspections were needed compared to a non-uniform distribution of objects, resulting in a longer path length. The adaptive planner proved to be robust against localization uncertainty. When increasing the number of objects, the flight path length increased, especially when the objects were uniformly distributed. When the objects were non-uniformly distributed, the adaptive path planner yielded a shorter path than a low-altitude coverage path, even with a high number of objects. Overall, the presented adaptive path planner allowed finding non-uniformly distributed objects in a field faster than a coverage path planner and resulted in a compatible detection accuracy. The path planner is made available at https://github.com/wur-abe/uav_adaptive_planner.

Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task. Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative quality, aligning closely with human judgment.

Abstract: Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video, audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a distinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality, cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized Audio--Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including egocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\% and 8.0\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4\% boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming SOTA baselines by 50.23\%. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BASHLab/RAVEN.

Abstract: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe neurological complication among premature infants, necessitating early and accurate detection from brain ultrasound (US) images to improve clinical outcomes. While recent deep learning methods offer promise for computer-aided diagnosis, challenges remain in capturing both local spatial details and global contextual dependencies critical for segmenting brain anatomies. In this work, we propose an enhanced Residual U-Net architecture incorporating two complementary attention mechanisms: the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Sparse Attention Layer (SAL). The CBAM improves the model's ability to refine spatial and channel-wise features, while the SAL introduces a dual-branch design, sparse attention filters out low-confidence query-key pairs to suppress noise, and dense attention ensures comprehensive information propagation. Extensive experiments on the Brain US dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with a Dice score of 89.04% and IoU of 81.84% for ventricle region segmentation. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating spatial refinement and attention sparsity for robust brain anatomy detection.

Abstract: Motion-related artifacts are inevitable in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and can bias automated neuroanatomical metrics such as cortical thickness. These biases can interfere with statistical analysis which is a major concern as motion has been shown to be more prominent in certain populations such as children or individuals with ADHD. Manual review cannot objectively quantify motion in anatomical scans, and existing quantitative automated approaches often require specialized hardware or custom acquisition protocols. Here, we train a 3D convolutional neural network to estimate a summary motion metric in retrospective routine research scans by leveraging a large training dataset of synthetically motion-corrupted volumes. We validate our method with one held-out site from our training cohort and with 14 fully independent datasets, including one with manual ratings, achieving a representative $R^2 = 0.65$ versus manual labels and significant thickness-motion correlations in 12/15 datasets. Furthermore, our predicted motion correlates with subject age in line with prior studies. Our approach generalizes across scanner brands and protocols, enabling objective, scalable motion assessment in structural MRI studies without prospective motion correction. By providing reliable motion estimates, our method offers researchers a tool to assess and account for potential biases in cortical thickness analyses.

<title>Enhancing Safety of Foundation Models for Visual Navigation through Collision Avoidance via Repulsive Estimation</title>

Abstract: We propose CARE (Collision Avoidance via Repulsive Estimation), a plug-and-play module that enhances the safety of vision-based navigation without requiring additional range sensors or fine-tuning of pretrained models. While recent foundation models using only RGB inputs have shown strong performance, they often fail to generalize in out-of-distribution (OOD) environments with unseen objects or variations in camera parameters (e.g., field of view, pose, or focal length). Without fine-tuning, these models may generate unsafe trajectories that lead to collisions, requiring costly data collection and retraining. CARE addresses this limitation by seamlessly integrating with any RGB-based navigation system that outputs local trajectories, dynamically adjusting them using repulsive force vectors derived from monocular depth maps. We evaluate CARE by combining it with state-of-the-art vision-based navigation models across multiple robot platforms. CARE consistently reduces collision rates (up to 100%) without sacrificing goal-reaching performance and improves collision-free travel distance by up to 10.7x in exploration tasks.

It introduces a new dataset called ViVo, which aims to capture real-world volumetric video production characteristics. ViVo includes human-centric features like skin and hair, as well as dynamic visual phenomena such as transparent and reflective surfaces. The dataset provides fourteen multi-view RGB and depth video pairs, synchronized at 30FPS with per-frame calibration and audio data, along with 2-D foreground masks and 3-D point clouds. The article also presents benchmarking results of three state-of-the-art 3-D reconstruction methods and two volumetric video compression algorithms using the ViVo dataset.

Abstract: As research on neural volumetric video reconstruction and compression flourishes, there is a need for diverse and realistic datasets, which can be used to develop and validate reconstruction and compression models. However, existing volumetric video datasets lack diverse content in terms of both semantic and low-level features that are commonly present in real-world production pipelines. In this context, we propose a new dataset, ViVo, for VolumetrIc VideO reconstruction and compression. The dataset is faithful to real-world volumetric video production and is the first dataset to extend the definition of diversity to include both human-centric characteristics (skin, hair, etc.) and dynamic visual phenomena (transparent, reflective, liquid, etc.). Each video sequence in this database contains raw data including fourteen multi-view RGB and depth video pairs, synchronized at 30FPS with per-frame calibration and audio data, and their associated 2-D foreground masks and 3-D point clouds. To demonstrate the use of this database, we have benchmarked three state-of-the-art (SotA) 3-D reconstruction methods and two volumetric video compression algorithms. The obtained results evidence the challenging nature of the proposed dataset and the limitations of existing datasets for both volumetric video reconstruction and compression tasks, highlighting the need to develop more effective algorithms for these applications.

Summary:
CAPAA introduces a novel approach to projector-based adversarial attacks, addressing limitations of existing methods. The framework incorporates a classifier-agnostic adversarial loss and optimization strategy that leverages gradients from multiple classifiers. An attention-based gradient weighting mechanism is proposed to enhance perturbation targeting in high classification activation regions, improving the effectiveness of adversarial projections across varying camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAPAA outperforms baseline methods in both attack success rate and stealthiness. The code for CAPAA is available on GitHub, offering a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of adversarial attacks and image classification. <div>

Abstract: Projector-based adversarial attack aims to project carefully designed light patterns (i.e., adversarial projections) onto scenes to deceive deep image classifiers. It has potential applications in privacy protection and the development of more robust classifiers. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual classifiers and fixed camera poses, often neglecting the complexities of multi-classifier systems and scenarios with varying camera poses. This limitation reduces their effectiveness when introducing new classifiers or camera poses. In this paper, we introduce Classifier-Agnostic Projector-Based Adversarial Attack (CAPAA) to address these issues. First, we develop a novel classifier-agnostic adversarial loss and optimization framework that aggregates adversarial and stealthiness loss gradients from multiple classifiers. Then, we propose an attention-based gradient weighting mechanism that concentrates perturbations on regions of high classification activation, thereby improving the robustness of adversarial projections when applied to scenes with varying camera poses. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CAPAA achieves both a higher attack success rate and greater stealthiness compared to existing baselines.

Summary:<br />
The MARIO challenge at MICCAI 2024 focused on automating the detection and monitoring of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. The challenge involved analyzing unique multi-modal datasets from Brest, France, and Algeria. Thirty-five teams participated in two tasks: classifying AMD evolution in OCT B-scans and predicting future AMD progression for patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy. AI performed comparably to physicians in measuring AMD progression but fell short in predicting future evolution. The challenge outcomes indicate the potential of AI in AMD monitoring using OCT, infrared imaging, and clinical data. The top methodologies showcased at the challenge set a benchmark for future research in AI-based AMD monitoring. Overall, the MARIO challenge highlighted the efficacy of AI in detecting AMD changes and laid the groundwork for further advancements in AMD management. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The MARIO challenge, held at MICCAI 2024, focused on advancing the automated detection and monitoring of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) through the analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Designed to evaluate algorithmic performance in detecting neovascular activity changes within AMD, the challenge incorporated unique multi-modal datasets. The primary dataset, sourced from Brest, France, was used by participating teams to train and test their models. The final ranking was determined based on performance on this dataset. An auxiliary dataset from Algeria was used post-challenge to evaluate population and device shifts from submitted solutions. Two tasks were involved in the MARIO challenge. The first one was the classification of evolution between two consecutive 2D OCT B-scans. The second one was the prediction of future AMD evolution over three months for patients undergoing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Thirty-five teams participated, with the top 12 finalists presenting their methods. This paper outlines the challenge's structure, tasks, data characteristics, and winning methodologies, setting a benchmark for AMD monitoring using OCT, infrared imaging, and clinical data (such as the number of visits, age, gender, etc.). The results of this challenge indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) performs as well as a physician in measuring AMD progression (Task 1) but is not yet able of predicting future evolution (Task 2).

Abstract: Global population aging presents increasing challenges to healthcare systems, with coronary artery disease (CAD) responsible for approximately 17.8 million deaths annually, making it a leading cause of global mortality. As CAD is largely preventable, early detection and proactive management are essential. In this work, we introduce DigitalShadow, an advanced early warning system for CAD, powered by a fine-tuned facial foundation model. The system is pre-trained on 21 million facial images and subsequently fine-tuned into LiveCAD, a specialized CAD risk assessment model trained on 7,004 facial images from 1,751 subjects across four hospitals in China. DigitalShadow functions passively and contactlessly, extracting facial features from live video streams without requiring active user engagement. Integrated with a personalized database, it generates natural language risk reports and individualized health recommendations. With privacy as a core design principle, DigitalShadow supports local deployment to ensure secure handling of user data.

Summary: <br />
This paper examines the susceptibility of Vision Transformers (ViTs) used in medical image analysis to adversarial attacks, specifically adversarial watermarking. The study reveals that ViTs are more vulnerable to such attacks, with an accuracy drop of up to 27.6%. However, implementing adversarial training can significantly enhance the model's defense mechanism, improving accuracy to 90.0%. While ViTs exhibit strong performance in clean image evaluation, their global attention mechanisms make them susceptible to imperceptible perturbations. This research highlights the importance of considering the potential vulnerabilities of transformer-based models in medical image analysis and the effectiveness of adversarial training in mitigating adversarial attacks. The findings suggest a crucial aspect to be addressed when utilizing ViTs for automated skin disease diagnosis. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously, convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless, adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.

Summary: 
A new fitness tracking system is introduced, enabling remote monitoring of exercises using only a smartphone camera.

This vision-language transformer model is the first of its kind to perform multiple tasks on skeletal fitness data. By combining exercise identification and rep counting in a single model, this research aims to make AI-powered fitness tracking more accessible and cost-effective. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a fitness tracking system that enables remote monitoring for exercises using only a RGB smartphone camera, making fitness tracking more private, scalable, and cost effective. Although prior work explored automated exercise supervision, existing models are either too limited in exercise variety or too complex for real-world deployment. Prior approaches typically focus on a small set of exercises and fail to generalize across diverse movements. In contrast, we develop a robust, multitask motion analysis model capable of performing exercise detection and repetition counting across hundreds of exercises, a scale far beyond previous methods. We overcome previous data limitations by assembling a large-scale fitness dataset, Olympia covering more than 1,900 exercises. To our knowledge, our vision-language model is the first that can perform multiple tasks on skeletal fitness data. On Olympia, our model can detect exercises with 76.5% accuracy and count repetitions with 85.3% off-by-one accuracy, using only RGB video. By presenting a single vision-language transformer model for both exercise identification and rep counting, we take a significant step toward democratizing AI-powered fitness tracking.

Summary:
In this study, a novel Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based semantic SLAM algorithm is introduced for incremental 3D scene representation from RGB-D video streams. Unlike traditional SLAM algorithms, this approach generates accurate and dense 3D maps by predicting Gaussian parameters using an RGB-D image recognition backbone. The integration of 3D semantic segmentation into the GS framework bridges mapping and recognition, enhancing performance. By optimizing the GS for only one iteration post-global localization, localization drifting and floaters are corrected. The algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet benchmark with significantly fewer Gaussians than previous methods and demonstrates generalization capabilities through zero-shot transfer to NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets. <div>

Abstract: Traditional SLAM algorithms are excellent at camera tracking but might generate lower resolution and incomplete 3D maps. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location. Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

Abstract: Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) aims to identify visual regions corresponding to sound sources, playing a vital role in video understanding, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps, enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for finegrained audiovisual segmentation.

Summary:
Error-minimizing attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) used for traffic sign recognition involve adding imperceptible perturbations to training data, significantly reducing prediction accuracy. A proposed data augmentation-based training method using nonlinear transformations effectively mitigates these attacks, restoring prediction accuracy to 96.05% from 10.6%. This method surpasses adversarial training in combating error-minimizing attacks. Additionally, a detection model capable of identifying poisoned data, even when perturbations are imperceptible, achieves a success rate of over 99%. The study underscores the importance of advanced training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to counter data poisoning attacks. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks. The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%. Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the effects of data poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a) classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with 81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile recycling pipelines.

Abstract: Surveillance systems play a critical role in security and reconnaissance, but their performance is often compromised by low-quality images and videos, leading to reduced accuracy in face recognition. Additionally, existing AI-based facial analysis models suffer from biases related to skin tone variations and partially occluded faces, further limiting their effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios. These challenges are the results of data limitations and imbalances, where available training datasets lack sufficient diversity, resulting in unfair and unreliable facial recognition performance. To address these issues, we propose a data-driven platform that enhances surveillance capabilities by generating synthetic training data tailored to compensate for dataset biases. Our approach leverages deep learning-based facial attribute manipulation and reconstruction using autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create diverse and high-quality facial datasets. Additionally, our system integrates an image enhancement module, improving the clarity of low-resolution or occluded faces in surveillance footage. We evaluate our approach using the CelebA dataset, demonstrating that the proposed platform enhances both training data diversity and model fairness. This work contributes to reducing bias in AI-based facial analysis and improving surveillance accuracy in challenging environments, leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

<div> Event cameras, motion dynamics, temporal resolution, motion segmentation, EV-LayerSegNet <br />
Summary:<br /> Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics with high temporal resolution. Traditional cameras struggle with capturing motion, but event cameras excel in tasks like motion segmentation. Training event-based networks is challenging due to the limited ground truth data availability. The article introduces EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based motion segmentation. It separates affine optical flow and segmentation masks for deblurring input events and uses deblurring quality as a self-supervised learning loss. Testing on a simulated dataset with only affine motion, the network achieves IoU and detection rates of up to 71% and 87%, respectively. <div>
arXiv:2506.06596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics with much higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras, since pixels react asynchronously to brightness changes. They are therefore better suited for tasks involving motion such as motion segmentation. However, training event-based networks still represents a difficult challenge, as obtaining ground truth is very expensive, error-prone and limited in frequency. In this article, we introduce EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based motion segmentation. Inspired by a layered representation of the scene dynamics, we show that it is possible to learn affine optical flow and segmentation masks separately, and use them to deblur the input events. The deblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss. We train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion, achieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.

<div> Keywords: vision-language models, medical applications, reasoning-aware reinforcement learning, diagnostic accuracy, computational efficiency

Summary: 
The article introduces a Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework (RARL) to enhance the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning. The framework focuses on improving diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality while maintaining computational efficiency for deployment in resource-constrained environments. RARL fine-tunes a lightweight base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward functions. Experimental results show that RARL outperforms supervised fine-tuning by approximately 7.78% on reasoning-focused tasks, with improved generalization capabilities on unseen datasets. Diversity prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are identified as key factors in enhancing VLM performance. The findings emphasize the potential of reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting in steering medical VLMs towards more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making. The code and data for the framework are publicly available. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical applications offers promising support for diagnostic reasoning. However, current medical VLMs often face limitations in generalization, transparency, and computational efficiency-barriers that hinder deployment in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose a Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \textbf{RARL}, that enhances the reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and adaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward functions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality. Training is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate the model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and explanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves VLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while requiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving around 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4% over traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial for enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making. Code and data are publicly available.

<div> Keywords: Composed image retrieval, fine-tuning, vision-language encoders, multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives

Summary: 
Fine-tuning a lightweight Q-Former with BLIP-2 significantly improves Recall@10 for Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) tasks, achieving higher recall percentages for specific items such as shirts, dresses, and top-tees on the FashionIQ benchmark. However, Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a focus on Direct Preference Optimization, falls short with extremely low Recall@10 results due to various limitations like the lack of joint image-text fusion, misaligned objective function, low-quality negatives, and frozen vision and Transformer layers. The study underscores the importance of genuine multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and the curation of high-quality negatives for successful preference-based CIR systems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) allows a user to locate a target image by applying a fine-grained textual edit (e.g., ``turn the dress blue'' or ``remove stripes'') to a reference image. Zero-shot CIR, which embeds the image and the text with separate pretrained vision-language encoders, reaches only 20-25\% Recall@10 on the FashionIQ benchmark. We improve this by fine-tuning BLIP-2 with a lightweight Q-Former that fuses visual and textual features into a single embedding, raising Recall@10 to 45.6\% (shirt), 40.1\% (dress), and 50.4\% (top-tee) and increasing the average Recall@50 to 67.6\%. We also examine Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a Direct Preference Optimization loss applied to FAISS-mined hard negatives. Despite extensive tuning of the scaling factor, index, and sampling strategy, Retrieval-DPO attains only 0.02\% Recall@10 -- far below zero-shot and prompt-tuned baselines -- because it (i) lacks joint image-text fusion, (ii) uses a margin objective misaligned with top-$K$ metrics, (iii) relies on low-quality negatives, and (iv) keeps the vision and Transformer layers frozen. Our results show that effective preference-based CIR requires genuine multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and carefully curated negatives.

Abstract: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity, which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2) limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises 620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis, etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies.

<div> Keywords: dark channel, depth-from-defocus, single image, adversarial training, depth estimation

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel approach to depth estimation from a single defocus blurred image using the dark channel as a complementary cue. This method leverages the local statistics of blurred images and scene structure to estimate depth accurately. While existing depth-from-defocus techniques require multiple images with varying settings, this approach focuses on the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast variations as depth cues. The pipeline is trained adversarially in an end-to-end fashion to improve performance. Experimental results on real data show that incorporating the dark channel prior enhances the accuracy of depth estimation from a single image. This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing scene structure and depth information.

arXiv:2506.06643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the dark channel as a complementary cue to estimate the depth of a scene from a single space-variant defocus blurred image due to its effectiveness in implicitly capturing the local statistics of blurred images and the scene structure. Existing depth-from-defocus (DFD) techniques typically rely on multiple images with varying apertures or focus settings to recover depth information. Very few attempts have focused on DFD from a single defocused image due to the underconstrained nature of the problem. Our method capitalizes on the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast variations as key depth cues to enhance the overall performance in estimating the scene's structure. The entire pipeline is trained adversarially in a fully end-to-end fashion. Experiments conducted on real data with realistic depth-induced defocus blur demonstrate that incorporating dark channel prior into single image DFD yields meaningful depth estimation results, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Summary:  
The Parametric Gaussian Human Model (PGHM) is introduced as a framework for fast and realistic avatar reconstruction from monocular videos. It incorporates human priors into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enhance rendering quality and efficiency. PGHM includes a UV-aligned latent identity map to encode subject-specific features and a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net to predict Gaussian attributes. This design allows for robust avatar rendering under challenging poses and viewpoints, with efficient subject adaptation that does not require lengthy optimization. Comparing to optimization-from-scratch methods, PGHM is significantly more efficient, taking only about 20 minutes per subject to generate avatars of similar visual quality. This makes PGHM practical for real-world applications of monocular avatar creation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photorealistic and animatable human avatars are a key enabler for virtual/augmented reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges, including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar creation.

<div> Keywords: post-disaster damage classification, flood-related building damages, deep learning framework, SAR/InSAR scenes, flood-risk layer <br />
Summary: 
The study introduces Flood-DamageSense, a novel deep-learning framework designed for building-level flood-damage assessment. Unlike existing models, it can accurately identify flood-related building damages, even when there are minimal compositional changes in the surroundings. By combining pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical basemaps and a flood-risk layer, the model predicts graded building-damage states, floodwater extent, and building footprints simultaneously. Training on imagery from Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas, the model outperforms existing baselines, particularly in the "minor" and "moderate" damage categories. Ablation studies highlight the importance of the inherent-risk feature in improving performance. The model's post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable damage maps quickly, providing crucial flood-damage intelligence for post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study, Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints. Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County, Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines, with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate" damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable, building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

Infertility has significant social and psychological effects and is expected to increase. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is commonly used in developed countries to address low fertility rates. Current embryo grading methods are inefficient and time-consuming. This study introduces an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework, using a CNN-LSTM architecture to classify embryos from blastocyst images accurately.

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life, affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer, yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM. Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Abstract: Omnidirectional image and video super-resolution is a crucial research topic in low-level vision, playing an essential role in virtual reality and augmented reality applications. Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or video frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation and enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years, numerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly based on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures, loss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper presents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and video super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that existing datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in capturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that comprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected under diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure settings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional benchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization capabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on both public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a systematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising directions for future exploration.

Summary: 
In this paper, new hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (HMCF-ACMs) are introduced, allowing for adaptive optimization in image segmentation by incorporating tunable initial velocity fields. The normal flow nature of HMCF-ACMs is proven, showing numerical equivalence with specific wave equations. Building on this, hyperbolic dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs) are developed, leveraging smooth Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to improve segmentation accuracy near weak boundaries. A weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization is optimized for solving the wave equations. Experimental results demonstrate that both HMCF-ACMs and HDRF-ACMs outperform traditional models, achieving more precise segmentations with enhanced noise resistance and numerical stability through task-adaptive configurations of initial velocities and contours.

Abstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of initial velocities and initial contours.

Summary:<br /><br />
Mitigating human-wildlife conflict is essential in resolving encounters between humans and animals. Computer Vision offers a solution to identify potentially conflicting individuals, such as the Big Five African animals. Current animal classification models are often trained under a closed-world assumption, leading to overconfidence in predictions when faced with unknown species. This study focuses on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. By utilizing parametric and non-parametric approaches with pretrained features, including Nearest Class Mean and contrastive learning, the study compares these methods to common OOD detection techniques. The results demonstrate that feature-based methods, particularly Nearest Class Mean with ImageNet pre-trained features, exhibit superior generalization capabilities across various classification thresholds. These findings highlight the importance of robust OOD detection methods in enhancing wildlife monitoring and conflict mitigation efforts. <div>

Abstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species. The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the best OOD methods, respectively.

Local Perception Search (LPS) is introduced as a simple and training-free decoding method for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to mitigate hallucination phenomena. LPS leverages local visual prior information to correct the decoding process during inference, effectively reducing the incidence of hallucinations. The impact of the local visual prior is more significant in scenarios with high levels of image noise. LPS is compatible with various models and shows exceptional performance in noisy settings. Extensive experiments on hallucination benchmarks and noisy data validate the efficacy of LPS in suppressing hallucinations and improving model performance. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline, showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

Summary: 
This paper introduces the novel task of SAR target structure recovery, aiming to infer target components and structural relationships from a single-view SAR image. The proposed approach utilizes structural descriptors and a two-step algorithmic framework. In the training phase, 2D keypoints are detected in real SAR images, and a mapping to 3D hierarchical structures is learned using simulated data. During testing, this approach integrates the steps to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of each step and demonstrate the capability of deriving the 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets directly from a single-view SAR image.

Abstract: To translate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into interpretable forms for human understanding is the ultimate goal of SAR advanced information retrieval. Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local geometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural modeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task: SAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target and the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry and adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural consistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed in different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of target directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a two-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed. Specifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real SAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical structures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are integrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results validated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time, that 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly derived from a single-view SAR image.

Abstract: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term forecasting. This work proposes modeling continuous-time rotational object dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of rotations.

Summary: <br />
A novel framework for identity-preserved stylized image synthesis using diffusion models is introduced. The "Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique significantly enhances identity retention in complex scenes, particularly for small facial regions or significant camera-to-face distances. A training-free content consistency loss is employed to improve the preservation of fine-grained content details by focusing more on the original image during stylization. The approach surpasses baseline models in maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust identity integrity without requiring model retraining or fine-tuning. <div>
arXiv:2506.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation is particularly acute for images where faces are small or exhibit significant camera-to-face distances, frequently leading to inadequate identity preservation. To address this, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized image synthesis using diffusion models. Key contributions include: (1) the "Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, significantly enhancing identity retention, especially in complex scenes; and (2) a training-free content consistency loss that enhances the preservation of fine-grained content details by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially surpasses the baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust identity integrity, particularly under conditions of small facial regions or significant camera-to-face distances, all without necessitating model retraining or fine-tuning.

<div> Keywords: promptable segmentation, Camouflaged Object Segmentation, test-time adaptation, region-constrained dual-stream visual prompting, multimodal stepwise decomposition

Summary: 
RDVP-MSD introduces a novel framework for Camouflaged Object Segmentation through test-time adaptation. It addresses two crucial issues faced by current methods: semantic ambiguity in obtaining instance-specific text prompts and semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in obtaining instance-specific visual prompts. The framework combines Region-constrained Dual-stream Visual Prompting (RDVP) with Multimodal Stepwise Decomposition (MSD-CoT) to tackle these challenges. MSD-CoT progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity, while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting, sampling visual prompts independently for foreground and background points. Remarkably, RDVP-MSD achieves state-of-the-art segmentation results on multiple benchmarks for Camouflaged Object Segmentation without requiring training or supervision. It not only improves segmentation accuracy but also enhances efficiency with faster inference speeds compared to previous methods. <div>
arXiv:2506.06818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2) \textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation, causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity, while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Summary: Hi-LSplat is a view-consistent Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting model for 3D open-vocabulary querying. It addresses view inconsistencies by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree through layered instance clustering. The model introduces instance-wise and part-wise contrastive losses to capture hierarchical semantic representations. Two hierarchical semantic datasets are created to evaluate the model's performance. Hi-LSplat demonstrates superior performance in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and localization, highlighting its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics in 3D scenes. <div>
arXiv:2506.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies. Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying. To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations. Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D scenes.

Summary: 
The study investigates Visual Prompting (VP) in the context of using a robust source model for transfer learning. It explores whether the robustness of the source model can be inherited by VP and if a trade-off between robustness and generalization ability exists during this process. The study introduces a strategy called Prompt Boundary Loosening (PBL) to mitigate this trade-off, enhancing both robustness inheritance and generalization ability in VP. Experiments across various datasets validate the effectiveness of PBL in improving VP performance. The study contributes novel insights into the impact of using robust source models in VP and provides a practical strategy to improve its overall performance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process? If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets. Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

Summary:
In this study, a novel attention-level control method is proposed for coupled image generation tasks, where multiple images with similar backgrounds are generated simultaneously. The method aims to separate background and entity components using cross-attention modules with time-varying weight control parameters. These parameters are optimized based on criteria such as background coupling, text-to-image alignment, and overall visual quality. The empirical results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of these criteria. The disentanglement of backgrounds allows for flexibility in generating centered objects based on different text prompts, while maintaining consistency in the backgrounds of the generated images. This approach enhances the overall quality and alignment of the generated images, making it a promising method for coupled image generation tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method disentangles the background and entity components in the model's cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across these criteria.

arXiv:2506.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes, characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2 foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks, significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical safety and efficiency.

<div> Keywords: Time-series anomaly detection, Vision language models, ViT4TS, VLM4TS, Efficiency 
Summary: 
Time-series anomaly detection is essential in various fields but existing methods lack visual-temporal reasoning capabilities. This study proposes a two-stage solution leveraging vision language models (VLMs). The first stage, ViT4TS, locates anomalies using a pretrained vision encoder on 2-D time-series representations. The second stage, VLM4TS, refines detections using global temporal context and VLM reasoning capacity. VLM4TS outperforms existing methods without time-series training, yielding a 24.6% improvement in F1-max score. It also surpasses language-model-based TSAD methods and is 36 times more efficient in token usage. Overall, the proposed approach combines vision and language models effectively for accurate and efficient time-series anomaly detection. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases, yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline. Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

<div> Keywords: 3D scene stylization, Gaussian Splatting, style transfer, segmentation network, memory efficiency

Summary: 
Multi-StyleGS is introduced as a novel solution for stylizing 3D scenes to match multiple artistic styles efficiently. The method uses a bipartite matching mechanism to automatically align style images with local regions of rendered scenes, allowing for automatic or manual style transfer. A semantic style loss function applies distinct styles to different objects in the scene, enhancing multi-view consistency.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes. While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.

Abstract: Inertial-based Motion capture system has been attracting growing attention due to its wearability and unsconstrained use. However, accurate human joint estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda) Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation, window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error. This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose, with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction, encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than reconstruction-based approaches.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new approach called DONUT for predicting the motion of other agents in a scene for autonomous driving. It utilizes a decoder-only model, encoding historical trajectories and predicting future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This method allows for iterative predictions and ensures the model always has the most recent information, leading to enhanced performance. Additionally, an 'overprediction' strategy is utilized to predict trajectories at longer time horizons, improving the model's ability to anticipate the future. Experimental results show that the decoder-only approach outperforms traditional encoder-decoder models and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

<div> Keywords: Visual reasoning, Multimodal Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, Knowledge infusion, Benchmark

Summary:
Visual reasoning is a key aspect in advancing Artificial General Intelligence and understanding complex multimodal data. Existing methods enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning, but they have limitations in sampling action groups only from the policy model itself. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Vision-EKIPL framework, which incorporates high-quality actions from external auxiliary models during RL training. This approach expands the model's exploration space, improves reasoning boundaries, and accelerates training convergence speed and efficiency. Experimental results show that Vision-EKIPL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark by up to 5%. The framework demonstrates the ability to enhance visual reasoning performance in MLLMs and provides a new effective paradigm for research in the field.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is crucial for understanding complex multimodal data and advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Existing methods enhance the reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning (e.g., GRPO). However, current RL approaches sample action groups solely from the policy model itself, which limits the upper boundary of the model's reasoning capability and leads to inefficient training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel RL framework called \textbf{Vision-EKIPL}. The core of this framework lies in introducing high-quality actions generated by external auxiliary models during the RL training process to guide the optimization of the policy model. The policy learning with knowledge infusion from external models significantly expands the model's exploration space, effectively improves the reasoning boundary, and substantially accelerates training convergence speed and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Vision-EKIPL achieved up to a 5\% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It reveals that Vision-EKIPL can overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, significantly enhance the visual reasoning performance of MLLMs, and provide a new effective paradigm for research in this field.

Summary:
The paper introduces an end-to-end 3D face recognition method for noisy point clouds that combines denoising and recognition modules. The proposed approach, cGAN-TOP, utilizes a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network to remove noise from the point cloud and extract underlying features for recognition.

Abstract: Face recognition using 3D point clouds is gaining growing interest, while raw point clouds often contain a significant amount of noise due to imperfect sensors. In this paper, an end-to-end 3D face recognition on a noisy point cloud is proposed, which synergistically integrates the denoising and recognition modules. Specifically, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) is designed to effectively remove the noise in the point cloud, and recover the underlying features for subsequent recognition. A Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) is then adapted to recognize faces from the processed point cloud, which hierarchically links both the local point features and neighboring features of multiple scales. The proposed method is validated on the Bosphorus dataset. It significantly improves the recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with a maximum gain of 14.81%.

<div> fMRI, NSD-Imagery, mental images, decoding models, benchmark dataset <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces the NSD-Imagery dataset, which pairs human fMRI activity with mental images to assess the performance of visual decoding models trained on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) on mental image reconstruction. The study highlights the importance of generalizing decoding methods from seen to mental imagery for applications in medical domains and brain-computer interfaces. Benchmarking various open-source decoding models on NSD-Imagery reveals that performance on mental images is distinct from vision reconstruction. The research indicates that simple linear decoding architectures and multimodal feature decoding models exhibit better generalization to mental imagery compared to complex architectures, which tend to overfit visual training data. Findings emphasize the necessity of mental imagery datasets for developing practical applications and establish NSD-Imagery as a valuable resource for aligning visual decoding methods with this objective. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction. Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction. We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a defense strategy, KNN-Defense, to enhance the robustness of 3D point cloud classifiers against adversarial attacks. The method leverages semantic similarity and nearest-neighbor search in feature space to restore perturbed inputs, improving accuracy across various attack types. Unlike existing methods focusing on surface geometry or point distribution, KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally efficient, suitable for real-time applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset show significant accuracy gains, particularly under point-dropping attacks. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches on models such as PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT. Overall, KNN-Defense offers a scalable and effective solution to enhance the adversarial resilience of 3D point cloud classifiers.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in analyzing 3D point cloud data. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge to the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the semantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing defense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named KNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and nearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface geometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores perturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples from the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally efficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and practical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset demonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various attack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing methods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the proposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively. These findings suggest that KNN-Defense offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the adversarial resilience of 3D point cloud classifiers. (An open-source implementation of the method, including code and data, is available at https://github.com/nimajam41/3d-knn-defense).

Summary:
GaME introduces a dynamic scene adaptation mechanism to update 3D representations constantly. It addresses both short-term and long-term dynamics in scenes, unlike previous static approaches. The system aims to maintain geometric and semantic consistency by managing keyframes effectively, discarding outdated observations while retaining maximum information. GaME is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, proving its superior accuracy compared to existing methods. The system's integration of Gaussian Mapping enables advanced view synthesis capabilities, making it beneficial for various applications such as augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. The innovative approach of GaME sets it apart from traditional mapping systems, offering a robust solution for handling evolving scenes efficiently.

arXiv:2506.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes. While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes (GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more accurate than the state of the art.

Summary:<br />
Accurate sleep stage classification is crucial for diagnosing sleep disorders in aging populations. This study explores using electrooculography (EOG) and pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) as less obtrusive alternatives to traditional EEG-based polysomnography for sleep-wake classification. The novel approach combines PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals using ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning model, to enhance classification accuracy. Results show that fine-tuning ImageBind outperforms existing models like DeepSleepNet and ViViT. The model displays strong adaptability to tasks with limited data, making it advantageous for medical applications. Evaluation on patient recordings suggests that pre-trained multimodal embedding models, originally developed for non-medical purposes, can be effectively adapted for sleep staging, achieving accuracies comparable to EEG-based systems. <div>

Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders, particularly in aging populations. While traditional polysomnography (PSG) relies on electroencephalography (EEG) as the gold standard, its complexity and need for specialized equipment make home-based sleep monitoring challenging. To address this limitation, we investigate the use of electrooculography (EOG) and pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) as less obtrusive alternatives for five-stage sleep-wake classification. This study introduces a novel approach that leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning model, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage classification. Our method is the first reported approach that fuses PSM and EOG data for sleep stage classification with ImageBind. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning ImageBind significantly improves classification accuracy, outperforming existing models based on single-channel EOG (DeepSleepNet), exclusively PSM data (ViViT), and other multimodal deep learning approaches (MBT). Notably, the model also achieved strong performance without fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability to specific tasks with limited labeled data, making it particularly advantageous for medical applications. We evaluated our method using 85 nights of patient recordings from a sleep clinic. Our findings suggest that pre-trained multimodal embedding models, even those originally developed for non-medical domains, can be effectively adapted for sleep staging, with accuracies approaching systems that require complex EEG data.

Abstract: Current smart glasses equipped with RGB cameras struggle to perceive the environment in low-light and high-speed motion scenarios due to motion blur and the limited dynamic range of frame cameras. Additionally, capturing dense images with a frame camera requires large bandwidth and power consumption, consequently draining the battery faster. These challenges are especially relevant for developing algorithms that can read text from images. In this work, we propose a novel event-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) approach for smart glasses. By using the eye gaze of the user, we foveate the event stream to significantly reduce bandwidth by around 98% while exploiting the benefits of event cameras in high-dynamic and fast scenes. Our proposed method performs deep binary reconstruction trained on synthetic data and leverages multimodal LLMs for OCR, outperforming traditional OCR solutions. Our results demonstrate the ability to read text in low light environments where RGB cameras struggle while using up to 2400 times less bandwidth than a wearable RGB camera.

While video-specific training is common, improvements over image-only training are marginal. A simple finetuning scheme using annotated image sequences for temporal reasoning tasks demonstrates comparable performance to video-trained LLMs. This suggests current models may underutilize the temporal features present in real videos. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms enabling image-trained LLMs to excel at temporal reasoning and to identify bottlenecks in video training approaches.

Abstract: Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities. This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

Summary:
Accurate and efficient object detection is crucial for autonomous vehicles, demanding low latency and high throughput. Traditional methods process full 360° LiDAR scans in a single pass, causing delays. To address this issue, streaming approaches sequentially process partial scans in polar coordinates but face challenges due to misaligned convolution operations. The Polar Hierarchical Mamba (PHiM) architecture, designed specifically for streaming LiDAR in polar coordinates, utilizes local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling. PHiM outperforms previous streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, achieving a 10% improvement and matching full-scan baselines at double the throughput. By replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware operations, PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art for streaming LiDAR object detection. <div>

LiDAR sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full 360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models (SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling, replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware, dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput. Code will be available at https://github.com/meilongzhang/Polar-Hierarchical-Mamba .

<div> Efficient Architecture, Multimodal Model, Image Generation, Vision-Language Tasks, Transformer Layers 
Summary:
Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based Transformer (LaTtE-Flow) is a new architecture designed to unify image understanding and generation in a single multimodal model. It leverages powerful pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for strong multimodal understanding and introduces a Layerwise Timestep Experts flow-based approach for efficient image generation. LaTtE-Flow distributes the flow-matching process across specialized groups of Transformer layers, improving sampling efficiency by activating only a subset of layers at each timestep. A Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism further enhances performance by enabling efficient information reuse across layers. Experimental results show that LaTtE-Flow achieves high performance on multimodal understanding tasks and competitive image generation quality, all while being around 6 times faster in inference speed compared to recent unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models unifying image understanding and generation have opened exciting avenues for tackling a wide range of vision-language tasks within a single framework. Despite progress, existing unified models typically require extensive pretraining and struggle to achieve the same level of performance compared to models dedicated to each task. Additionally, many of these models suffer from slow image generation speeds, limiting their practical deployment in real-time or resource-constrained settings. In this work, we propose Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based Transformer (LaTtE-Flow), a novel and efficient architecture that unifies image understanding and generation within a single multimodal model. LaTtE-Flow builds upon powerful pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to inherit strong multimodal understanding capabilities, and extends them with a novel Layerwise Timestep Experts flow-based architecture for efficient image generation. LaTtE-Flow distributes the flow-matching process across specialized groups of Transformer layers, each responsible for a distinct subset of timesteps. This design significantly improves sampling efficiency by activating only a small subset of layers at each sampling timestep. To further enhance performance, we propose a Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism for efficient information reuse across layers. Experiments demonstrate that LaTtE-Flow achieves strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks, while achieving competitive image generation quality with around 6x faster inference speed compared to recent unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution refers to the reconstruction of a high-resolution image from a single low-resolution observation. Although recent deep learning-based methods have demonstrated notable success on simulated datasets -- with low-resolution images obtained by degrading and downsampling high-resolution ones -- they frequently fail to generalize to real-world settings, such as document scans, which are affected by complex degradations and semantic variability. In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task learning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically optimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate auxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text detection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a convolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net, and hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic weight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of each loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon the SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for single-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and real-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach improves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while preserving overall image fidelity. These findings underscore the value of multi-objective optimization in super-resolution models for bridging the gap between simulated training regimes and practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Summary: Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG) enhances image generation by incorporating knearest neighbor retrievals at the patch level dynamically. Unlike existing methods, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each generation step using prior-generated patches as queries. This allows the model to respond to evolving generation needs and avoids limitations like over-copying and stylistic bias. Two frameworks, Distribution-Augmentation in Decoding (DAiD) and Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), are proposed to implement AR-RAG effectively. DAiD merges predicted patch distributions with retrieved patch distributions, while FAiD fine-tunes retrieved patch features to augment the generation process efficiently. Validation on benchmarks shows significant performance gains over state-of-the-art image generation models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g., over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art image generation models.

<title>Dual-view Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion with CNN-Transformer Hybrid Network for Chinese Isolated Sign Language Recognition</title>

Abstract: Due to the emergence of many sign language datasets, isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) has made significant progress in recent years. In addition, the development of various advanced deep neural networks is another reason for this breakthrough. However, challenges remain in applying the technique in the real world. First, existing sign language datasets do not cover the whole sign vocabulary. Second, most of the sign language datasets provide only single view RGB videos, which makes it difficult to handle hand occlusions when performing ISLR. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dual-view sign language dataset for ISLR named NationalCSL-DP, which fully covers the Chinese national sign language vocabulary. The dataset consists of 134140 sign videos recorded by ten signers with respect to two vertical views, namely, the front side and the left side. Furthermore, a CNN transformer network is also proposed as a strong baseline and an extremely simple but effective fusion strategy for prediction. Extensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the datasets as well as the baseline. The results show that the proposed fusion strategy can significantly increase the performance of the ISLR, but it is not easy for the sequence-to-sequence model, regardless of whether the early-fusion or late-fusion strategy is applied, to learn the complementary features from the sign videos of two vertical views.

Abstract: Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced semantic distinctions.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated exceptional performance in image-based 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, regions with complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.

<title>Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Commonality-Oriented Gradient Optimization</title>

Abstract: Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Dual-camera super-resolution is highly practical for smartphone photography that primarily super-resolve the wide-angle images using the telephoto image as a reference. In this paper, we propose DM$^3$Net, a novel dual-camera super-resolution network based on Domain Modulation and Multi-scale Matching. To bridge the domain gap between the high-resolution domain and the degraded domain, we learn two compressed global representations from image pairs corresponding to the two domains. To enable reliable transfer of high-frequency structural details from the reference image, we design a multi-scale matching module that conducts patch-level feature matching and retrieval across multiple receptive fields to improve matching accuracy and robustness. Moreover, we also introduce Key Pruning to achieve a significant reduction in memory usage and inference time with little model performance sacrificed. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DM$^3$Net outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: This technical report presents the implementation details of the winning solution for the ICRA 2025 GOOSE 3D Semantic Segmentation Challenge. This challenge focuses on semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds from diverse unstructured outdoor environments collected from multiple robotic platforms. This problem was addressed by implementing Point Prompt Tuning (PPT) integrated with Point Transformer v3 (PTv3) backbone, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous LiDAR data through platform-specific conditioning and cross-dataset class alignment strategies. The model is trained without requiring additional external data. As a result, this approach achieved substantial performance improvements with mIoU increases of up to 22.59% on challenging platforms compared to the baseline PTv3 model, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive point cloud understanding for field robotics applications.

<title>BePo: Leveraging Birds Eye View and Sparse Points for Efficient and Accurate 3D Occupancy Prediction</title>

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods, however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand, points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention, which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo. Moreover, BePo also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest efficient approaches.

Abstract: This work presents UNO, a unified monocular visual odometry framework that enables robust and adaptable pose estimation across diverse environments, platforms, and motion patterns. Unlike traditional methods that rely on deployment-specific tuning or predefined motion priors, our approach generalizes effectively across a wide range of real-world scenarios, including autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, mobile robots, and handheld devices. To this end, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy for local state estimation, with several specialized decoders that each handle a distinct class of ego-motion patterns. Moreover, we introduce a fully differentiable Gumbel-Softmax module that constructs a robust inter-frame correlation graph, selects the optimal expert decoder, and prunes erroneous estimates. These cues are then fed into a unified back-end that combines pre-trained, scale-independent depth priors with a lightweight bundling adjustment to enforce geometric consistency. We extensively evaluate our method on three major benchmark datasets: KITTI (outdoor/autonomous driving), EuRoC-MAV (indoor/aerial drones), and TUM-RGBD (indoor/handheld), demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: To address the challenges of table structure recognition, we propose a novel Split-Merge-based top-down model optimized for large, densely populated tables. Our approach formulates row and column splitting as sequence labeling tasks, utilizing dual Transformer encoders to capture feature interactions. The merging process is framed as a grid cell classification task, leveraging an additional Transformer encoder to ensure accurate and coherent merging. By eliminating unstable bounding box predictions, our method reduces resolution loss and computational complexity, achieving high accuracy while maintaining fast processing speed. Extensive experiments on FinTabNet and PubTabNet demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing approaches, particularly in real-world applications. Our method offers a robust, scalable, and efficient solution for large-scale table recognition, making it well-suited for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale, audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65% relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation, we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations. However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Abstract: Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance, outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.

Abstract: We introduce Layered Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (LSSKD) framework for training compact deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods that rely on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory data under weak supervision.

Abstract: The robustness of Deep Neural Network models is crucial for defending models against adversarial attacks. Recent defense methods have employed collaborative learning frameworks to enhance model robustness. Two key limitations of existing methods are (i) insufficient guidance of the target model via loss functions and (ii) non-collaborative adversarial generation. We, therefore, propose a dual regularization loss (D2R Loss) method and a collaborative adversarial generation (CAG) strategy for adversarial training. D2R loss includes two optimization steps. The adversarial distribution and clean distribution optimizations enhance the target model's robustness by leveraging the strengths of different loss functions obtained via a suitable function space exploration to focus more precisely on the target model's distribution. CAG generates adversarial samples using a gradient-based collaboration between guidance and target models. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark databases, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and two popular target models, WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18. Our results show that D2R loss with CAG produces highly robust models.

Abstract: The growing availability of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) data enables accurate global land cover and crop type monitoring. However, the volume and heterogeneity of these datasets pose major processing and annotation challenges. To address this, the French National Institute of Geographical and Forest Information (IGN) is actively exploring innovative strategies to exploit diverse EO data, which require large annotated datasets. IGN introduces FLAIR-HUB, the largest multi-sensor land cover dataset with very-high-resolution (20 cm) annotations, covering 2528 km2 of France. It combines six aligned modalities: aerial imagery, Sentinel-1/2 time series, SPOT imagery, topographic data, and historical aerial images. Extensive benchmarks evaluate multimodal fusion and deep learning models (CNNs, transformers) for land cover or crop mapping and also explore multi-task learning. Results underscore the complexity of multimodal fusion and fine-grained classification, with best land cover performance (78.2% accuracy, 65.8% mIoU) achieved using nearly all modalities. FLAIR-HUB supports supervised and multimodal pretraining, with data and code available at https://ignf.github.io/FLAIR/flairhub.

<title>UCOD-DPL: Unsupervised Camouflaged Object Detection via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07087</link>

Abstract: Unsupervised Camoflaged Object Detection (UCOD) has gained attention since it doesn't need to rely on extensive pixel-level labels. Existing UCOD methods typically generate pseudo-labels using fixed strategies and train 1 x1 convolutional layers as a simple decoder, leading to low performance compared to fully-supervised methods. We emphasize two drawbacks in these approaches: 1). The model is prone to fitting incorrect knowledge due to the pseudo-label containing substantial noise. 2). The simple decoder fails to capture and learn the semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized objects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between foreground and background pixels. To this end, we propose a UCOD method with a teacher-student framework via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning called UCOD-DPL, which contains an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial (DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism. The APM module adaptively combines pseudo-labels generated by fixed strategies and the teacher model to prevent the model from overfitting incorrect knowledge while preserving the ability for self-correction; the DBA decoder takes adversarial learning of different segmentation objectives, guides the model to overcome the foreground-background confusion of camouflaged objects, and the Look-Twice mechanism mimics the human tendency to zoom in on camouflaged objects and performs secondary refinement on small-sized objects. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates outstanding performance, even surpassing some existing fully supervised methods. The code is available now.

<title>SceneLCM: End-to-End Layout-Guided Interactive Indoor Scene Generation with Latent Consistency Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07091</link>

Abstract: Our project page: https://scutyklin.github.io/SceneLCM/. Automated generation of complex, interactive indoor scenes tailored to user prompt remains a formidable challenge. While existing methods achieve indoor scene synthesis, they struggle with rigid editing constraints, physical incoherence, excessive human effort, single-room limitations, and suboptimal material quality. To address these limitations, we propose SceneLCM, an end-to-end framework that synergizes Large Language Model (LLM) for layout design with Latent Consistency Model(LCM) for scene optimization. Our approach decomposes scene generation into four modular pipelines: (1) Layout Generation. We employ LLM-guided 3D spatial reasoning to convert textual descriptions into parametric blueprints(3D layout). And an iterative programmatic validation mechanism iteratively refines layout parameters through LLM-mediated dialogue loops; (2) Furniture Generation. SceneLCM employs Consistency Trajectory Sampling(CTS), a consistency distillation sampling loss guided by LCM, to form fast, semantically rich, and high-quality representations. We also offer two theoretical justification to demonstrate that our CTS loss is equivalent to consistency loss and its distillation error is bounded by the truncation error of the Euler solver; (3) Environment Optimization. We use a multiresolution texture field to encode the appearance of the scene, and optimize via CTS loss. To maintain cross-geometric texture coherence, we introduce a normal-aware cross-attention decoder to predict RGB by cross-attending to the anchors locations in geometrically heterogeneous instance. (4)Physically Editing. SceneLCM supports physically editing by integrating physical simulation, achieved persistent physical realism. Extensive experiments validate SceneLCM's superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, showing its wide-ranging potential for diverse applications.

<title>EdgeSpotter: Multi-Scale Dense Text Spotting for Industrial Panel Monitoring</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07112</link>

Abstract: Text spotting for industrial panels is a key task for intelligent monitoring. However, achieving efficient and accurate text spotting for complex industrial panels remains challenging due to issues such as cross-scale localization and ambiguous boundaries in dense text regions. Moreover, most existing methods primarily focus on representing a single text shape, neglecting a comprehensive exploration of multi-scale feature information across different texts. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel multi-scale dense text spotter for edge AI-based vision system (EdgeSpotter) to achieve accurate and robust industrial panel monitoring. Specifically, a novel Transformer with efficient mixer is developed to learn the interdependencies among multi-level features, integrating multi-layer spatial and semantic cues. In addition, a new feature sampling with catmull-rom splines is designed, which explicitly encodes the shape, position, and semantic information of text, thereby alleviating missed detections and reducing recognition errors caused by multi-scale or dense text regions. Furthermore, a new benchmark dataset for industrial panel monitoring (IPM) is constructed. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on this challenging benchmark dataset validate the superior performance of the proposed method in different challenging panel monitoring tasks. Finally, practical tests based on the self-designed edge AI-based vision system demonstrate the practicality of the method. The code and demo will be available at https://github.com/vision4robotics/EdgeSpotter.

Abstract: Industry partners provided a problem statement that involves classifying electronic waste using machine learning models that will be used by pick-and-place robots for waste segregation. We started by taking common electronic waste items, such as a mouse and charger, unsoldering them, and taking pictures to create a custom dataset. Then state-of-the art YOLOv11 model was trained and run to achieve 70 mAP in real-time. Mask-RCNN model was also trained and achieved 41 mAP. The model will be further integrated with pick-and-place robots to perform segregation of e-waste.

<title>Hi-VAE: Efficient Video Autoencoding with Global and Detailed Motion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have advanced video generation, but existing methods fail to efficiently model spatio-temporal redundancies in dynamics, resulting in suboptimal compression factors. This shortfall leads to excessive training costs for downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce Hi-VAE, an efficient video autoencoding framework that hierarchically encode coarse-to-fine motion representations of video dynamics and formulate the decoding process as a conditional generation task. Specifically, Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into two latent spaces: Global Motion, capturing overarching motion patterns, and Detailed Motion, encoding high-frequency spatial details. Using separate self-supervised motion encoders, we compress video latents into compact motion representations to reduce redundancy significantly. A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs videos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling high-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\times$, almost 30$\times$ higher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\times$), validating the efficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction quality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream generative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability, providing new perspectives for future exploration in video latent representation and generation.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile, weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The source code and trained weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/LLaVA-STF.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GoTrack, an efficient and accurate CAD-based method for 6DoF object pose refinement and tracking, which can handle diverse objects without any object-specific training. Unlike existing tracking methods that rely solely on an analysis-by-synthesis approach for model-to-frame registration, GoTrack additionally integrates frame-to-frame registration, which saves compute and stabilizes tracking. Both types of registration are realized by optical flow estimation. The model-to-frame registration is noticeably simpler than in existing methods, relying only on standard neural network blocks (a transformer is trained on top of DINOv2) and producing reliable pose confidence scores without a scoring network. For the frame-to-frame registration, which is an easier problem as consecutive video frames are typically nearly identical, we employ a light off-the-shelf optical flow model. We demonstrate that GoTrack can be seamlessly combined with existing coarse pose estimation methods to create a minimal pipeline that reaches state-of-the-art RGB-only results on standard benchmarks for 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking. Our source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/gotrack

<title>Faster than Fast: Accelerating Oriented FAST Feature Detection on Low-end Embedded GPUs</title>

Abstract: The visual-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technology widely used in applications such as robotic navigation and virtual reality, which primarily focuses on detecting feature points from visual images to construct an unknown environmental map and simultaneously determines its own location. It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over 7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality, directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks, which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for a wide range of tasks and input signals.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a dominant paradigm, yet its highly entangled black-box models pose significant challenges in terms of interpretability and safety assurance. To improve model transparency and training flexibility, this paper proposes a hierarchical and decoupled post-training framework tailored for pretrained neural networks. By reconstructing intermediate feature maps from ground-truth labels, surrogate supervisory signals are introduced at transitional layers to enable independent training of specific components, thereby avoiding the complexity and coupling of conventional end-to-end backpropagation and providing interpretable insights into networks' internal mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to formalize feature-level reverse computation as well-posed optimization problems, which we rigorously reformulate as systems of linear equations or least squares problems. This establishes a novel and efficient training paradigm that extends gradient backpropagation to feature backpropagation. Extensive experiments on multiple standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior generalization performance and computational efficiency compared to traditional training approaches, validating its effectiveness and potential.

<title>SAP-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models in Surgical Action Planning</title>

Abstract: Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research. The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the 1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152 strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5, Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction performance.

Abstract: Video editing has garnered increasing attention alongside the rapid progress of diffusion-based video generation models. As part of these advancements, there is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video editing, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused on tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution, and attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the source video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel objects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing framework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify vital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the quality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method enables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively injecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding layers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition, we further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding to the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the prominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental results demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both object addition and non-rigid video editing. Project Page: https://emjay73.github.io/TV_LiVE/

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance, but are also vulnerable to backdoor attacks whereby the adversary can manipulate the model's outputs through hidden triggers. Prior attacks primarily rely on single-modality triggers, leaving the crucial cross-modal fusion nature of VLMs largely unexplored. Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that leverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers. Based on this insight, we propose BadSem (Backdoor Attack with Semantic Manipulation), a data poisoning attack that injects stealthy backdoors by deliberately misaligning image-text pairs during training. To perform the attack, we construct SIMBad, a dataset tailored for semantic manipulation involving color and object attributes. Extensive experiments across four widely used VLMs show that BadSem achieves over 98% average ASR, generalizes well to out-of-distribution datasets, and can transfer across poisoning modalities. Our detailed analysis using attention visualization shows that backdoored models focus on semantically sensitive regions under mismatched conditions while maintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. To mitigate the attack, we try two defense strategies based on system prompt and supervised fine-tuning but find that both of them fail to mitigate the semantic backdoor. Our findings highlight the urgent need to address semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs for their safer deployment.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial technique in deep learning, particularly for tasks with limited dataset diversity, such as skeleton-based datasets. This paper proposes a comprehensive data augmentation framework that integrates geometric transformations, random cropping, rotation, zooming and intensity-based transformations, brightness and contrast adjustments to simulate real-world variations. Random cropping ensures the preservation of spatio-temporal integrity while addressing challenges such as viewpoint bias and occlusions. The augmentation pipeline generates three augmented versions for each sample in addition to the data set sample, thus quadrupling the data set size and enriching the diversity of gesture representations. The proposed augmentation strategy is evaluated on three models: multi-stream e2eET, FPPR point cloud-based hand gesture recognition (HGR), and DD-Network. Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets including DHG14/28, SHREC'17, and JHMDB. The e2eET model, recognized as the state-of-the-art for hand gesture recognition on DHG14/28 and SHREC'17. The FPPR-PCD model, the second-best performing model on SHREC'17, excels in point cloud-based gesture recognition. DD-Net, a lightweight and efficient architecture for skeleton-based action recognition, is evaluated on SHREC'17 and the Human Motion Data Base (JHMDB). The results underline the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed augmentation strategy, significantly improving model generalization and robustness across diverse datasets and architectures. This framework not only establishes state-of-the-art results on all three evaluated models but also offers a scalable solution to advance HGR and action recognition applications in real-world scenarios. The framework is available at https://github.com/NadaAbodeshish/Random-Cropping-augmentation-HGR

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences, leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute, count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines, including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities by integrating visual perception with language understanding, enabling applications such as image-grounded dialogue, visual question answering, and scientific analysis. However, most MLLMs adopt a static inference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront, which limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to context during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which is dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform iterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual actions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning should terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising supervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning comparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy but also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes. These results demonstrate the promise of dynamic inference mechanisms for enabling fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in next-generation MLLMs.

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools, capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation models in vision.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.

<title>FANVID: A Benchmark for Face and License Plate Recognition in Low-Resolution Videos</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07304</link>

Abstract: Real-world surveillance often renders faces and license plates unrecognizable in individual low-resolution (LR) frames, hindering reliable identification. To advance temporal recognition models, we present FANVID, a novel video-based benchmark comprising nearly 1,463 LR clips (180 x 320, 20--60 FPS) featuring 63 identities and 49 license plates from three English-speaking countries. Each video includes distractor faces and plates, increasing task difficulty and realism. The dataset contains 31,096 manually verified bounding boxes and labels.
  FANVID defines two tasks: (1) face matching -- detecting LR faces and matching them to high-resolution mugshots, and (2) license plate recognition -- extracting text from LR plates without a predefined database. Videos are downsampled from high-resolution sources to ensure that faces and text are indecipherable in single frames, requiring models to exploit temporal information. We introduce evaluation metrics adapted from mean Average Precision at IoU > 0.5, prioritizing identity correctness for faces and character-level accuracy for text.
  A baseline method with pre-trained video super-resolution, detection, and recognition achieved performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate recognition), highlighting both the feasibility and challenge of the tasks. FANVID's selection of faces and plates balances diversity with recognition challenge. We release the software for data access, evaluation, baseline, and annotation to support reproducibility and extension. FANVID aims to catalyze innovation in temporal modeling for LR recognition, with applications in surveillance, forensics, and autonomous vehicles.

<title>AllTracker: Efficient Dense Point Tracking at High Resolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AllTracker: a model that estimates long-range point tracks by way of estimating the flow field between a query frame and every other frame of a video. Unlike existing point tracking methods, our approach delivers high-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be visualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates, propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train on a wider set of datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance. We provide an extensive ablation study on our architecture details and training recipe, making it clear which details matter most. Our code and model weights are available at https://alltracker.github.io .

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets, suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than existing methods.

<title>Hierarchical Scoring with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Instance Image-Goal Navigation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07338</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) requires autonomous agents to identify and navigate to a target object or location depicted in a reference image captured from any viewpoint. While recent methods leverage powerful novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting (3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues. This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and real-world applicability.

<title>CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO: Enhancing Agricultural Object Detection through Spatially Adaptive Attention Mechanisms</title>

Abstract: Object detection is vital in precision agriculture for plant monitoring, disease detection, and yield estimation. However, models like YOLO struggle with occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise, reducing detection accuracy. While Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) improve spatial invariance through learned transformations, affine mappings are insufficient for non-rigid deformations such as bent leaves and overlaps.
  We propose CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO, a model integrating Thin-Plate Splines (TPS) into STNs for flexible, non-rigid spatial transformations that better align features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant spatial and channel-wise features.
  On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection performance.
  This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate and efficient monitoring.

<title>Multiple Object Stitching for Unsupervised Representation Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence, compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations. In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised representation performance on both single object centric images and multi-object ones.

Abstract: For the immanent challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in the medical field, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a promising solution. Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an $\textit{Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning}$ module dedicated to refining boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a $\textit{Dynamic Complementary Competition}$ module that leverages two high-performing sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our approach achieves a notable improvement of at least $6\%$, highlighting the significant advancements. The code is available at https://github.com/Y-TARL/C3S3.

Abstract: The rise of deep generative models has greatly advanced video compression, reshaping the paradigm of face video coding through their powerful capability for semantic-aware representation and lifelike synthesis. Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could characterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream compactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models to reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at the decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable high-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far surpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of GFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies, systematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and industrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of existing GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization strategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we construct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the most appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the GFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a low-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future practical deployments and applications. Finally, we envision the potential of GFVC in industrial applications and deliberate on the current challenges and future opportunities.

<title>ARGUS: Hallucination and Omission Evaluation in Video-LLMs</title>

arXiv:2506.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions, ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships. Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video captioning performance.

Abstract: Collaborative perception plays a crucial role in enhancing environmental understanding by expanding the perceptual range and improving robustness against sensor failures, which primarily involves collaborative 3D detection and tracking tasks. The former focuses on object recognition in individual frames, while the latter captures continuous instance tracklets over time. However, existing works in both areas predominantly focus on the vehicle superclass, lacking effective solutions for both multi-class collaborative detection and tracking. This limitation hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios, which involve diverse object classes with varying appearances and motion patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework tailored for diverse road users. We first present a detector with a global spatial attention fusion (GSAF) module, enhancing multi-scale feature learning for objects of varying sizes. Next, we introduce a tracklet RE-IDentification (REID) module that leverages visual semantics with a vision foundation model to effectively reduce ID SWitch (IDSW) errors, in cases of erroneous mismatches involving small objects like pedestrians. We further design a velocity-based adaptive tracklet management (VATM) module that adjusts the tracking interval dynamically based on object motion. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both detection and tracking accuracy.

<title>Adapter Naturally Serves as Decoupler for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation</title>

arXiv:2506.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler. Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information. Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN), which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection. However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval. Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large models in resource-constrained environments has underscored the need for efficient transmission of intermediate feature representations. In this context, feature coding, which compresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for scenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this compression process introduces inherent semantic degradation that is notoriously difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this, this paper introduces the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality Assessment (CFQA), which seeks to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed features. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset, comprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from three vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance drops are provided as true semantic distortion for the evaluation of CFQA metrics. We assess the performance of three widely used metrics (MSE, cosine similarity, and Centered Kernel Alignment) in capturing semantic degradation. The results underscore the representativeness of the dataset and highlight the need for more refined metrics capable of addressing the nuances of semantic distortion in compressed features. To facilitate the ongoing development of CFQA research, we release the dataset and all accompanying source code at \href{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}. This contribution aims to advance the field and provide a foundational resource for the community to explore CFQA.

Abstract: In continual learning, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem may make the models fall into the stability-plasticity dilemma. Moreover, inter-task confusion will also occur due to the lack of knowledge exchanges between different tasks. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel dynamic prompt transformer (DPFormer) with prompt schemes. The prompt schemes help the DPFormer memorize learned knowledge of previous classes and tasks, and keep on learning new knowledge from new classes and tasks under a single network structure with a nearly fixed number of model parameters. Moreover, they also provide discrepant information to represent different tasks to solve the inter-task confusion problem. Based on prompt schemes, a unified classification module with the binary cross entropy loss, the knowledge distillation loss and the auxiliary loss is proposed to train the whole model in an end-to-end trainable manner. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best performance in the CIFAR-100, ImageNet100 and ImageNet1K datasets under different class-incremental settings in continual learning. The source code will be available at our GitHub after acceptance.

Abstract: Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs. Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.

Abstract: The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However, despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more reliable AI-assisted safety systems.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in motion capture and generative artificial intelligence, leveraging large-scale MoCap datasets to train generative models for synthesizing diverse, realistic human motions has become a promising research direction. However, existing motion-capture techniques and generative models often neglect physical constraints, leading to artifacts such as interpenetration, sliding, and floating. These issues are exacerbated in multi-person motion generation, where complex interactions are involved. To address these limitations, we introduce physical mapping, integrated throughout the human interaction generation pipeline. Specifically, motion imitation within a physics-based simulation environment is used to project target motions into a physically valid space. The resulting motions are adjusted to adhere to real-world physics constraints while retaining their original semantic meaning. This mapping not only improves MoCap data quality but also directly informs post-processing of generated motions. Given the unique interactivity of multi-person scenarios, we propose a tailored motion representation framework. Motion Consistency (MC) and Marker-based Interaction (MI) loss functions are introduced to improve model performance. Experiments show our method achieves impressive results in generated human motion quality, with a 3%-89% improvement in physical fidelity. Project page http://yw0208.github.io/physiinter

<title>GLOS: Sign Language Generation with Temporally Aligned Gloss-Level Conditioning</title>

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second, we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC), to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method, which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO (Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval~(PRVR) aims to retrieve a video where a specific segment is relevant to a given text query. Typical training processes of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria: uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.

Abstract: Prompt tuning, which adapts vision-language models by freezing model parameters and optimizing only the prompt, has proven effective for task-specific adaptations. The core challenge in prompt tuning is improving specialization for a specific task and generalization for unseen domains. However, frozen encoders often produce misaligned features, leading to confusion between classes and limiting specialization. To overcome this issue, we propose a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) that improves specialization by refining the decision boundaries between confusing classes. Additionally, we mathematically demonstrate that a mixture model can enhance generalization without compromising specialization. This is achieved using confidence-aware weights (CoA-weights), which adjust the weights of each prediction in the mixture model based on its confidence within the class domains. Extensive experiments show that CoCoA-Mix, a mixture model with CoA-loss and CoA-weights, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing specialization and generalization. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/url-kaist/CoCoA-Mix.

<title>Drive Any Mesh: 4D Latent Diffusion for Mesh Deformation from Video</title>

Abstract: We propose DriveAnyMesh, a method for driving mesh guided by monocular video. Current 4D generation techniques encounter challenges with modern rendering engines. Implicit methods have low rendering efficiency and are unfriendly to rasterization-based engines, while skeletal methods demand significant manual effort and lack cross-category generalization. Animating existing 3D assets, instead of creating 4D assets from scratch, demands a deep understanding of the input's 3D structure. To tackle these challenges, we present a 4D diffusion model that denoises sequences of latent sets, which are then decoded to produce mesh animations from point cloud trajectory sequences. These latent sets leverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing 3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal, transformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple latent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DriveAnyMesh can rapidly produce high-quality animations for complex motions and is compatible with modern rendering engines. This method holds potential for applications in both the gaming and filming industries.

Abstract: SpatialLM is a large language model designed to process 3D point cloud data and generate structured 3D scene understanding outputs. These outputs include architectural elements like walls, doors, windows, and oriented object boxes with their semantic categories. Unlike previous methods which exploit task-specific network designs, our model adheres to the standard multimodal LLM architecture and is fine-tuned directly from open-source LLMs.
  To train SpatialLM, we collect a large-scale, high-quality synthetic dataset consisting of the point clouds of 12,328 indoor scenes (54,778 rooms) with ground-truth 3D annotations, and conduct a careful study on various modeling and training decisions. On public benchmarks, our model gives state-of-the-art performance in layout estimation and competitive results in 3D object detection. With that, we show a feasible path for enhancing the spatial understanding capabilities of modern LLMs for applications in augmented reality, embodied robotics, and more.

Abstract: We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.

<title>MoQAE: Mixed-Precision Quantization for Long-Context LLM Inference via Mixture of Quantization-Aware Experts</title>

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts (MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally, we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper addresses key aspects of domain randomization in generating synthetic data for manufacturing object detection applications. To this end, we present a comprehensive data generation pipeline that reflects different factors: object characteristics, background, illumination, camera settings, and post-processing. We also introduce the Synthetic Industrial Parts Object Detection dataset (SIP15-OD) consisting of 15 objects from three industrial use cases under varying environments as a test bed for the study, while also employing an industrial dataset publicly available for robotic applications. In our experiments, we present more abundant results and insights into the feasibility as well as challenges of sim-to-real object detection. In particular, we identified material properties, rendering methods, post-processing, and distractors as important factors. Our method, leveraging these, achieves top performance on the public dataset with Yolov8 models trained exclusively on synthetic data; mAP@50 scores of 96.4% for the robotics dataset, and 94.1%, 99.5%, and 95.3% across three of the SIP15-OD use cases, respectively. The results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed domain randomization, potentially covering the distribution close to real data for the applications.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution, 3D, and non-invasive visualization of retinal layers in vivo, serving as a critical tool for lesion localization and disease diagnosis. However, its widespread adoption is limited by equipment costs and the need for specialized operators. In comparison, 2D color fundus photography offers faster acquisition and greater accessibility with less dependence on expensive devices. Although generative artificial intelligence has demonstrated promising results in medical image synthesis, translating 2D fundus images into 3D OCT images presents unique challenges due to inherent differences in data dimensionality and biological information between modalities. To advance generative models in the fundus-to-3D-OCT setting, the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS-2024) organized a challenge titled Artificial Intelligence-based OCT Generation from Fundus Images. This paper details the challenge framework (referred to as APTOS-2024 Challenge), including: the benchmark dataset, evaluation methodology featuring two fidelity metrics-image-based distance (pixel-level OCT B-scan similarity) and video-based distance (semantic-level volumetric consistency), and analysis of top-performing solutions. The challenge attracted 342 participating teams, with 42 preliminary submissions and 9 finalists. Leading methodologies incorporated innovations in hybrid data preprocessing or augmentation (cross-modality collaborative paradigms), pre-training on external ophthalmic imaging datasets, integration of vision foundation models, and model architecture improvement. The APTOS-2024 Challenge is the first benchmark demonstrating the feasibility of fundus-to-3D-OCT synthesis as a potential solution for improving ophthalmic care accessibility in under-resourced healthcare settings, while helping to expedite medical research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes each private image into a concise textual description using image to text models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images, greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

<title>Cross-channel Perception Learning for H&amp;E-to-IHC Virtual Staining</title>

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital pathology, virtual staining has become a key technology in multimedia medical information systems, offering new possibilities for the analysis and diagnosis of pathological images. However, existing H&amp;E-to-IHC studies often overlook the cross-channel correlations between cell nuclei and cell membranes. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy. Specifically, CCPL first decomposes HER2 immunohistochemical staining into Hematoxylin and DAB staining channels, corresponding to cell nuclei and cell membranes, respectively. Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder, CCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and measures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features of the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder, are also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's feature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden. Additionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density maps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and intensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists, demonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates high-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated pathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation offers significant creative potential yet faces considerable challenges. The absence of fine-grained multimodal data and the difficulty of flexible multi-conditional generation limit previous works on generation controllability and diversity in practice. In this paper, we build OpenDance5D, an extensive human dance dataset comprising over 101 hours across 14 distinct genres. Each sample has five modalities to facilitate robust cross-modal learning: RGB video, audio, 2D keypoints, 3D motion, and fine-grained textual descriptions from human arts. Furthermore, we propose OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling framework for controllable dance generation conditioned on music and arbitrary combinations of text prompts, keypoints, or character positioning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OpenDanceNet achieves high-fidelity and flexible controllability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the task of writer retrieval, which identifies documents authored by the same individual within a dataset based on handwriting similarities. While existing datasets and methodologies primarily focus on page level retrieval, we explore the impact of text quantity on writer retrieval performance by evaluating line- and word level retrieval. We examine three state-of-the-art writer retrieval systems, including both handcrafted and deep learning-based approaches, and analyze their performance using varying amounts of text. Our experiments on the CVL and IAM dataset demonstrate that while performance decreases by 20-30% when only one line of text is used as query and gallery, retrieval accuracy remains above 90% of full-page performance when at least four lines are included. We further show that text-dependent retrieval can maintain strong performance in low-text scenarios. Our findings also highlight the limitations of handcrafted features in low-text scenarios, with deep learning-based methods like NetVLAD outperforming traditional VLAD encoding.

<title>LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization</title>

Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.

<title>Learning Speaker-Invariant Visual Features for Lipreading</title>

Abstract: Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color, texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules (Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers, implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal. Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), harnessing the complementarity among diverse modalities, are often considered more robust than pure Language Large Models (LLMs); yet do LMMs know what they do not know? There are three key open questions remaining: (1) how to evaluate the uncertainty of diverse LMMs in a unified manner, (2) how to prompt LMMs to show its uncertainty, and (3) how to quantify uncertainty for downstream tasks. In an attempt to address these challenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed to reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or capabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations to uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the formulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying uncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks spanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source) demonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM uncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination detection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Abstract: Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently, multi-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale pretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different modalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal interactions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct interactions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained encoders as "super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association (RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper multi-modal interactions, for prompting various video understanding tasks in downstream. Extensive experiments show that, our SEN can remarkably boost the four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition, chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard index improves 2.7%, temporal coherence(TC) drops 8.8% compared to the popular CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%, and frame consistency increases 4.1% compared to the popular TuneA-Video approach.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and photorealistic image generation across diverse applications. However, these models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations, sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without needing access to the original training data. The generated images are sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks, including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the target model.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for video understanding, effectively understanding long-form video content remains underexplored due to the vast scale and high complexity of video data. Current RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content, confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is pivotal for enabling automated intraoperative decision-making, skill assessment, and postoperative quality improvement. However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset, \textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}. SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11 specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories (phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis, action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain generalization to unseen procedures and modalities. Our dataset and code are available upon request.

Abstract: Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention from the community. However, it faces two key challenges: (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}}) current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed \textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate \textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform existing approaches. Code will be released on github.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is often limited by the scarcity of labeled datasets due to the high cost and complexity of real-world data collection. To mitigate this, recent work has explored generating virtual inertial measurement unit (IMU) data via cross-modality transfer. While video-based and language-based pipelines have each shown promise, they differ in assumptions and computational cost. Moreover, their effectiveness relative to traditional sensor-level data augmentation remains unclear. In this paper, we present a direct comparison between these two virtual IMU generation approaches against classical data augmentation techniques. We construct a large-scale virtual IMU dataset spanning 100 diverse activities from Kinetics-400 and simulate sensor signals at 22 body locations. The three data generation strategies are evaluated on benchmark HAR datasets (UTD-MHAD, PAMAP2, HAD-AW) using four popular models. Results show that virtual IMU data significantly improves performance over real or augmented data alone, particularly under limited-data conditions. We offer practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies and highlight the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have substantially extended the boundaries of visual understanding capabilities. However, their high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. A key source of inefficiency stems from the VLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs contain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the associated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a novel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core contribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic event vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition, EP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB visual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions of the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving tokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This strategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while accurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input. Experimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency improvements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline models from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original Qwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the original accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset. This work demonstrates the potential of event-based vision priors for improving VLM inference efficiency, paving the way for creating more efficient and deployable VLMs for sustainable visual understanding at the edge.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images is one of the most important tasks in computer graphics. Unfortunately, existing datasets and benchmarks concentrate on idealized synthetic or meticulously captured realistic data. Such benchmarks fail to convey the inherent complexities encountered in newly acquired real-world scenes. In such scenes especially those acquired outside, the background is often dynamic, and by popular usage of cell phone cameras, there might be discrepancies in, e.g., white balance. To address this gap, we present HuSc3D, a novel dataset specifically designed for rigorous benchmarking of 3D reconstruction models under realistic acquisition challenges. Our dataset uniquely features six highly detailed, fully white sculptures characterized by intricate perforations and minimal textural and color variation. Furthermore, the number of images per scene varies significantly, introducing the additional challenge of limited training data for some instances alongside scenes with a standard number of views. By evaluating popular 3D reconstruction methods on this diverse dataset, we demonstrate the distinctiveness of HuSc3D in effectively differentiating model performance, particularly highlighting the sensitivity of methods to fine geometric details, color ambiguity, and varying data availability--limitations often masked by more conventional datasets.

<title>HieraEdgeNet: A Multi-Scale Edge-Enhanced Framework for Automated Pollen Recognition</title>

Abstract: Automated pollen recognition is vital to paleoclimatology, biodiversity monitoring, and public health, yet conventional methods are hampered by inefficiency and subjectivity. Existing deep learning models often struggle to achieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like pollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and complex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a multi-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the introduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM), which explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that corresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic Edge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic information at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel Module (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers using an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel convolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally efficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset comprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline models such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms that our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely focused on object boundaries. By systematically integrating edge information, HieraEdgeNet provides a robust and powerful solution for high-precision, high-efficiency automated detection of microscopic objects.

Abstract: Reasoning over visual relationships-spatial, functional, interactional, social, etc.-is considered to be a fundamental component of human cognition. Yet, despite the major advances in visual comprehension in multimodal language models (MLMs), precise reasoning over relationships and their generations remains a challenge. We introduce ROBIN: an MLM instruction-tuned with densely annotated relationships capable of constructing high-quality dense scene graphs at scale. To train ROBIN, we curate SVG, a synthetic scene graph dataset by completing the missing relations of selected objects in existing scene graphs using a teacher MLM and a carefully designed filtering process to ensure high-quality. To generate more accurate and rich scene graphs at scale for any image, we introduce SG-EDIT: a self-distillation framework where GPT-4o further refines ROBIN's predicted scene graphs by removing unlikely relations and/or suggesting relevant ones. In total, our dataset contains 146K images and 5.6M relationships for 2.6M objects. Results show that our ROBIN-3B model, despite being trained on less than 3 million instances, outperforms similar-size models trained on over 300 million instances on relationship understanding benchmarks, and even surpasses larger models up to 13B parameters. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in referring expression comprehension with a score of 88.9, surpassing the previous best of 87.4. Our results suggest that training on the refined scene graph data is crucial to maintaining high performance across diverse visual reasoning task.

Abstract: Accurate lesion segmentation in histopathology images is essential for diagnostic interpretation and quantitative analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the limited availability of costly pixel-level annotations. To address this, we propose FMaMIL, a novel two-stage framework for weakly supervised lesion segmentation based solely on image-level labels. In the first stage, a lightweight Mamba-based encoder is introduced to capture long-range dependencies across image patches under the MIL paradigm. To enhance spatial sensitivity and structural awareness, we design a learnable frequency-domain encoding module that supplements spatial-domain features with spectrum-based information. CAMs generated in this stage are used to guide segmentation training. In the second stage, we refine the initial pseudo labels via a CAM-guided soft-label supervision and a self-correction mechanism, enabling robust training even under label noise. Extensive experiments on both public and private histopathology datasets demonstrate that FMaMIL outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods without relying on pixel-level annotations, validating its effectiveness and potential for digital pathology applications.

<title>ProSplat: Improved Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting for Wide-Baseline Sparse Views</title>

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated promising results for novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, particularly under narrow-baseline conditions. However, its performance significantly degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through joint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that ProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent SOTA methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for neural scene reconstruction, offering high-quality novel view synthesis while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS beyond pure scene representation by introducing an approach for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without requiring manual labeling, termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions. We show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++ validation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) has made it increasingly accessible for anyone to become a 3D content creator. While recent methods leverage Score Distillation Sampling to distill 3D objects from pretrained image diffusion models, they often suffer from inadequate 3D priors, leading to insufficient multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce NOVA3D, an innovative single-image-to-3D generation framework. Our key insight lies in leveraging strong 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and integrating geometric information during multi-view video fine-tuning. To facilitate information exchange between color and geometric domains, we propose the Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention mechanism, thereby improving generalization and multi-view consistency. Moreover, we introduce the de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm, which improves texture fidelity by addressing multi-view inaccuracies and resolving discrepancies in pose alignment. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NOVA3D over existing baselines.

Abstract: Prior methodologies have disregarded the diversities among distinct degradation types during image reconstruction, employing a uniform network model to handle multiple deteriorations. Nevertheless, we discover that prevalent degradation modalities, including sampling, blurring, and noise, can be roughly categorized into two classes. We classify the first class as spatial-agnostic dominant degradations, less affected by regional changes in image space, such as downsampling and noise degradation. The second class degradation type is intimately associated with the spatial position of the image, such as blurring, and we identify them as spatial-specific dominant degradations. We introduce a dynamic filter network integrating global and local branches to address these two degradation types. This network can greatly alleviate the practical degradation problem. Specifically, the global dynamic filtering layer can perceive the spatial-agnostic dominant degradation in different images by applying weights generated by the attention mechanism to multiple parallel standard convolution kernels, enhancing the network's representation ability. Meanwhile, the local dynamic filtering layer converts feature maps of the image into a spatially specific dynamic filtering operator, which performs spatially specific convolution operations on the image features to handle spatial-specific dominant degradations. By effectively integrating both global and local dynamic filtering operators, our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms in both synthetic and real image datasets.

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), a biologically inspired neural network infrastructure, has garnered significant attention recently. SNNs utilize binary spike activations for efficient information transmission, replacing multiplications with additions, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. However, binary spike activation maps often fail to capture sufficient data information, resulting in reduced accuracy. To address this challenge, we advocate reversing the bit of the weight and activation for SNNs, called \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, inspired by recent findings that highlight greater accuracy degradation from quantizing activations compared to weights. Specifically, our method employs real-valued spike activations alongside binary weights in SNNs. This preserves the event-driven and multiplication-free advantages of standard SNNs while enhancing the information capacity of activations. Additionally, we introduce a trainable factor within binary weights to adaptively learn suitable weight amplitudes during training, thereby increasing network capacity. To maintain efficiency akin to vanilla \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, our trainable binary weight SNNs are converted back to standard form using a re-parameterization technique during inference. Extensive experiments across various network architectures and datasets, both static and dynamic, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a common dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes action-critical image regions. Evaluated on the Bench2Drive CARLA Leaderboard-v2 benchmark, ETA advances state-of-the-art performance by 8% with a driving score of 69.53 while maintaining a near-real-time inference speed at 50 ms.

Abstract: Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue, inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection, the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2, Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by 72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only 4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3 times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.

Abstract: Recent research on generative models has primarily focused on creating product-ready visual outputs; however, designers often favor access to standardized asset libraries, a domain that has yet to be significantly enhanced by generative capabilities. Although open-world scenes provide ample raw materials for designers, efficiently extracting high-quality, standardized assets remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce AssetDropper, the first framework designed to extract assets from reference images, providing artists with an open-world asset palette. Our model adeptly extracts a front view of selected subjects from input images, effectively handling complex scenarios such as perspective distortion and subject occlusion. We establish a synthetic dataset of more than 200,000 image-subject pairs and a real-world benchmark with thousands more for evaluation, facilitating the exploration of future research in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to ensure precise asset extraction that aligns well with the image prompts, we employ a pre-trained reward model to fulfill a closed-loop with feedback. We design the reward model to perform an inverse task that pastes the extracted assets back into the reference sources, which assists training with additional consistency and mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments show that, with the aid of reward-driven optimization, AssetDropper achieves the state-of-the-art results in asset extraction. Project page: AssetDropper.github.io.

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery. However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises 1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms, ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition, with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of architectural culture.

However, the real-world robustness is limited by animated synthetic datasets for training. This introduces domain gaps when applied to real-world applications and limits the benefits of scaling up datasets. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Flow-Anything}, a large-scale data generation framework designed to learn optical flow estimation from any single-view images in the real world. We employ two effective steps to make data scaling-up promising. First, we convert a single-view image into a 3D representation using advanced monocular depth estimation networks. This allows us to render optical flow and novel view images under a virtual camera. Second, we develop an Object-Independent Volume Rendering module and a Depth-Aware Inpainting module to model the dynamic objects in the 3D representation. These two steps allow us to generate realistic datasets for training from large-scale single-view images, namely \textbf{FA-Flow Dataset}. For the first time, we demonstrate the benefits of generating optical flow training data from large-scale real-world images, outperforming the most advanced unsupervised methods and supervised methods on synthetic datasets. Moreover, our models serve as a foundation model and enhance the performance of various downstream video tasks.

Abstract: How can we generate an image B' that satisfies A:A'::B:B', given the input images A,A' and B? Recent works have tackled this challenge through approaches like visual in-context learning or visual instruction. However, these methods are typically limited to specific models (e.g. InstructPix2Pix. Inpainting models) rather than general diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion, SDXL). This dependency may lead to inherited biases or lower editing capabilities. In this paper, we propose Difference Inversion, a method that isolates only the difference from A and A' and applies it to B to generate a plausible B'. To address model dependency, it is crucial to structure prompts in the form of a "Full Prompt" suitable for input to stable diffusion models, rather than using an "Instruction Prompt". To this end, we accurately extract the Difference between A and A' and combine it with the prompt of B, enabling a plug-and-play application of the difference. To extract a precise difference, we first identify it through 1) Delta Interpolation. Additionally, to ensure accurate training, we propose the 2) Token Consistency Loss and 3) Zero Initialization of Token Embeddings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Difference Inversion outperforms existing baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, indicating its ability to generate more feasible B' in a model-agnostic manner.

Abstract: We introduce a trend-aware and visually-grounded fashion recommendation system that integrates deep visual representations, garment-aware segmentation, semantic category similarity and user behavior simulation. Our pipeline extracts focused visual embeddings by masking non-garment regions via semantic segmentation followed by feature extraction using pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, VGG16). To simulate realistic shopping behavior, we generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness and item popularity. Recommendations are computed using a weighted scoring function that fuses visual similarity, semantic coherence and popularity alignment. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate consistent gender alignment and improved category relevance, with ResNet-50 achieving 64.95% category similarity and lowest popularity MAE. An ablation study confirms the complementary roles of visual and popularity cues. Our method provides a scalable framework for personalized fashion recommendations that balances individual style with emerging trends. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/meddjilani/FashionRecommender

Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer, Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.

<title>Design and Evaluation of Deep Learning-Based Dual-Spectrum Image Fusion Methods</title>

Abstract: Visible images offer rich texture details, while infrared images emphasize salient targets. Fusing these complementary modalities enhances scene understanding, particularly for advanced vision tasks under challenging conditions. Recently, deep learning-based fusion methods have gained attention, but current evaluations primarily rely on general-purpose metrics without standardized benchmarks or downstream task performance. Additionally, the lack of well-developed dual-spectrum datasets and fair algorithm comparisons hinders progress.
  To address these gaps, we construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset captured in campus environments, comprising 1,369 well-aligned visible-infrared image pairs across four representative scenarios: daytime, nighttime, smoke occlusion, and underpasses. We also propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation framework that integrates fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection performance using the lang-segment-anything model to ensure fairness in downstream evaluation.
  Extensive experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms under this framework. Results demonstrate that fusion models optimized for downstream tasks achieve superior performance in target detection, especially in low-light and occluded scenes. Notably, some algorithms that perform well on general metrics do not translate to strong downstream performance, highlighting limitations of current evaluation practices and validating the necessity of our proposed framework.
  The main contributions of this work are: (1)a campus-oriented dual-spectrum dataset with diverse and challenging scenes; (2) a task-aware, comprehensive evaluation framework; and (3) thorough comparative analysis of leading fusion methods across multiple datasets, offering insights for future development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly improved performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS, which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets, significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods. It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.

Abstract: Vision encoders are increasingly used in modern applications, from vision-only models to multimodal systems such as vision-language models. Despite their remarkable success, it remains unclear how these architectures represent features internally. Here, we propose a novel approach for interpreting vision features via image reconstruction. We compare two related model families, SigLIP and SigLIP2, which differ only in their training objective, and show that encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain significantly more image information than those trained on non-image tasks such as contrastive learning. We further apply our method to a range of vision encoders, ranking them by the informativeness of their feature representations. Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the feature space yields predictable changes in reconstructed images, revealing that orthogonal rotations (rather than spatial transformations) control color encoding. Our approach can be applied to any vision encoder, shedding light on the inner structure of its feature space. The code and model weights to reproduce the experiments are available in GitHub.

Abstract: Recent advancements in codebook-based real image super-resolution (SR) have shown promising results in real-world applications. The core idea involves matching high-quality image features from a codebook based on low-resolution (LR) image features. However, existing methods face two major challenges: inaccurate feature matching with the codebook and poor texture detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided and Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key components: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to focus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that enhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and (3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information between LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to existing methods. We will release the code upon formal publication.

<title>Looking Beyond Visible Cues: Implicit Video Question Answering via Dual-Clue Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions based on the given video, with prior work primarily focusing on identifying the duration of relevant segments, referred to as explicit visual evidence. However, explicit visual evidence is not always directly available, particularly when questions target symbolic meanings or deeper intentions, leading to significant performance degradation. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel task and dataset, $\textbf{I}$mplicit $\textbf{V}$ideo $\textbf{Q}$uestion $\textbf{A}$nswering (I-VQA), which focuses on answering questions in scenarios where explicit visual evidence is inaccessible. Given an implicit question and its corresponding video, I-VQA requires answering based on the contextual visual cues present within the video. To tackle I-VQA, we propose a novel reasoning framework, IRM (Implicit Reasoning Model), incorporating dual-stream modeling of contextual actions and intent clues as implicit reasoning chains. IRM comprises the Action-Intent Module (AIM) and the Visual Enhancement Module (VEM). AIM deduces and preserves question-related dual clues by generating clue candidates and performing relation deduction. VEM enhances contextual visual representation by leveraging key contextual clues. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our IRM in I-VQA tasks, outperforming GPT-4o, OpenAI-o3, and fine-tuned VideoChat2 by $0.76\%$, $1.37\%$, and $4.87\%$, respectively. Additionally, IRM performs SOTA on similar implicit advertisement understanding and future prediction in traffic-VQA. Datasets and codes are available for double-blind review in anonymous repo: https://github.com/tychen-SJTU/Implicit-VideoQA.

<title>Self-Cascaded Diffusion Models for Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution aims to upsample images to any desired resolution, offering greater flexibility than traditional fixed-scale super-resolution. Recent approaches in this domain utilize regression-based or generative models, but many of them are a single-stage upsampling process, which may be challenging to learn across a wide, continuous distribution of scaling factors. Progressive upsampling strategies have shown promise in mitigating this issue, yet their integration with diffusion models for flexible upscaling remains underexplored. Here, we present CasArbi, a novel self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution. CasArbi meets the varying scaling demands by breaking them down into smaller sequential factors and progressively enhancing the image resolution at each step with seamless transitions for arbitrary scales. Our novel coordinate-guided residual diffusion model allows for the learning of continuous image representations while enabling efficient diffusion sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CasArbi outperforms prior arts in both perceptual and distortion performance metrics across diverse arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

<title>M2Restore: Mixture-of-Experts-based Mamba-CNN Fusion Framework for All-in-One Image Restoration</title>

Abstract: Natural images are often degraded by complex, composite degradations such as rain, snow, and haze, which adversely impact downstream vision applications. While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity, preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual quality and quantitative performance.

<title>R3D2: Realistic 3D Asset Insertion via Diffusion for Autonomous Driving Simulation</title>

Abstract: Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential. Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast, neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2 significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see https://research.zenseact.com/publications/R3D2/.

arXiv:2506.07841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on diffusion models proposed that they operate in two regimes: memorization, in which models reproduce their training data, and generalization, in which they generate novel samples. While this has been tested in high-noise settings, the behavior of diffusion models as effective denoisers when the corruption level is small remains unclear. To address this gap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under low-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and interpretability. Using (i) CelebA subsets of varying sample sizes and (ii) analytic Gaussian mixture benchmarks, we reveal that models trained on disjoint data diverge near the data manifold even when their high-noise outputs converge. We quantify how training set size, data geometry, and model objective choice shape denoising trajectories and affect score accuracy, providing insights into how these models actually learn representations of data distributions. This work starts to address gaps in our understanding of generative model reliability in practical applications where small perturbations are common.

arXiv:2506.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39, respectively. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack fine-grained controllability, especially for multi-subject customization with consistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift. Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing open-source and commercial baselines.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives, our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments, making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.

Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point clouds without needing human labels in training. Existing methods usually formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the absence of human labels during training.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system for table tennis using event cameras. Unlike standard cameras, which suffer from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms, including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based 30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception. Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from an egocentric perspective using event cameras.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks, existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in training.

Abstract: Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications. In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount. Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency. Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of aerial and satellite imagery, deep learning presents significant potential for transportation asset management, safety analysis, and urban planning. This study introduces CrosswalkNet, a robust and efficient deep learning framework designed to detect various types of pedestrian crosswalks from 15-cm resolution aerial images. CrosswalkNet incorporates a novel detection approach that improves upon traditional object detection strategies by utilizing oriented bounding boxes (OBB), enhancing detection precision by accurately capturing crosswalks regardless of their orientation. Several optimization techniques, including Convolutional Block Attention, a dual-branch Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast module, and cosine annealing, are implemented to maximize performance and efficiency. A comprehensive dataset comprising over 23,000 annotated crosswalk instances is utilized to train and validate the proposed framework. The best-performing model achieves an impressive precision of 96.5% and a recall of 93.3% on aerial imagery from Massachusetts, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness. CrosswalkNet has also been successfully applied to datasets from New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine without transfer learning or fine-tuning, showcasing its robustness and strong generalization capability. Additionally, the crosswalk detection results, processed using High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms and provided in polygon shapefile format, have been shown to accelerate data processing and detection, supporting real-time analysis for safety and mobility applications. This integration offers policymakers, transportation engineers, and urban planners an effective instrument to enhance pedestrian safety and improve urban mobility.

Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video, depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction. These capabilities enable systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from temporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction, egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric video. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project page: https://egom2p.github.io/

Abstract: Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through intuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful concepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance creates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even illegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored explicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our method requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a "safe" and an "unsafe" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their per-layer latent differences produces a "refusal vector", which, once subtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We introduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference of embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target concept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus preserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the model's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the original training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the model's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust against adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output filters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we can neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity, graphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks.

Abstract: Building on the success of text-based reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, extending these capabilities to multimodal reasoning holds great promise. While recent works have attempted to adapt DeepSeek-R1-style reinforcement learning (RL) training paradigms to multimodal large language models (MLLM), focusing on domain-specific tasks like math and visual perception, a critical question remains: How can we achieve the general-purpose visual-language reasoning through RL? To address this challenge, we make three key efforts: (1) A novel Scalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline that autonomously generates context-aware, reasoning-centric question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the given images. (2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K multimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse dataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive exploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that combines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL training efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM benchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances performance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks. Moreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase data diversity to further improve model performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring the everchanging landscapes of the Earth. The U-Net architecture has gained popularity for its capability to capture spatial information and perform pixel-wise classification. However, their application in the Remote sensing field remains largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper fill the gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of 34 papers. This study conducts a comparison and analysis of 18 different U-Net variations, assessing their potential for detecting changes in remote sensing. We evaluate both benefits along with drawbacks of each variation within the framework of this particular application. We emphasize variations that are explicitly built for change detection, such as Siamese Swin-U-Net, which utilizes a Siamese architecture. The analysis highlights the significance of aspects such as managing data from different time periods and collecting relationships over a long distance to enhance the precision of change detection. This study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners that choose U-Net versions for remote sensing change detection tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts. While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception- and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as intended in MM-ICL.

<title>Decoupling the Image Perception and Multimodal Reasoning for Reasoning Segmentation with Digital Twin Representations</title>

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text, enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an LLM.

Abstract: This article presents a large-scale effort to create a structured dataset of internal migration in Finland between 1800 and 1920 using digitized church moving records. These records, maintained by Evangelical-Lutheran parishes, document the migration of individuals and families and offer a valuable source for studying historical demographic patterns. The dataset includes over six million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten migration records.
  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a structured dataset suitable for research.
  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland. A case study from the Elim\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be reconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival material can be transformed into structured data to support historical and demographic research.

Abstract: Manual slide creation is labor-intensive and requires expert prior knowledge. Existing natural language-based LLM generation methods struggle to capture the visual and structural nuances of slide designs. To address this, we formalize the Reference Image to Slide Generation task and propose Slide2Code, the first benchmark with difficulty-tiered samples based on a novel Slide Complexity Metric. We introduce SlideCoder, a layout-aware, retrieval-augmented framework for generating editable slides from reference images. SlideCoder integrates a Color Gradient-based Segmentation algorithm and a Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation method to decompose complex tasks and enhance code generation. We also release SlideMaster, a 7B open-source model fine-tuned with improved reverse-engineered data. Experiments show that SlideCoder outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 40.5 points, demonstrating strong performance across layout fidelity, execution accuracy, and visual consistency.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may struggle with understanding long or complex videos due to computational demands at test time, lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, primarily stemming from their feed-forward processing nature. These limitations could be more severe for models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0% improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts. Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for dynamic video understanding. The code is released at https://github.com/marinero4972/CyberV.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions, including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model comparisons within the T2I research community.

Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient method for real-time three-dimensional football trajectory reconstruction from a single broadcast camera. In contrast to previous work, our approach introduces a multi-mode state model with $W$ discrete modes to significantly accelerate optimization while preserving centimeter-level accuracy -- even in cases of severe occlusion, motion blur, and complex backgrounds. The system operates on standard CPUs and achieves low latency suitable for live broadcast settings. Extensive evaluation on a proprietary dataset of 6K-resolution Russian Premier League matches demonstrates performance comparable to multi-camera systems, without the need for specialized or costly infrastructure. This work provides a practical method for accessible and accurate 3D ball tracking in professional football environments.

Abstract: The CXR-LT series is a community-driven initiative designed to enhance lung disease classification using chest X-rays (CXR). It tackles challenges in open long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT 2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45 disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for chest radiography.

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activations space is an important component of mechanistic interpretability. As such, many algorithms have been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is often not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce the best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but they can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this paper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a cost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In contrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation matches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation describes neuron activations across all inputs. To estimate this effectively, we introduce a novel application of importance sampling to determine which inputs are the most valuable to show to raters, leading to around 30x cost reduction compared to uniform sampling. We also analyze the label noise present in crowd-sourced evaluations and propose a Bayesian method to aggregate multiple ratings leading to a further ~5x reduction in number of ratings required for the same accuracy. Finally, we use these methods to conduct a large-scale study comparing the quality of neuron explanations produced by the most popular methods for two different vision models.

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment. When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead. We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance, attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided image editing have achieved notable success by leveraging natural language prompts for fine-grained semantic control. However, certain editing semantics are challenging to specify precisely using textual descriptions alone. A practical alternative involves learning editing semantics from paired source-target examples. Existing exemplar-based editing methods still rely on text prompts describing the change within paired examples or learning implicit text-based editing instructions. In this paper, we introduce PairEdit, a novel visual editing method designed to effectively learn complex editing semantics from a limited number of image pairs or even a single image pair, without using any textual guidance. We propose a target noise prediction that explicitly models semantic variations within paired images through a guidance direction term. Moreover, we introduce a content-preserving noise schedule to facilitate more effective semantic learning. We also propose optimizing distinct LoRAs to disentangle the learning of semantic variations from content. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics while significantly improving content consistency compared to baseline methods.

<title>UA-Pose: Uncertainty-Aware 6D Object Pose Estimation and Online Object Completion with Partial References</title>

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects. However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed 3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating 6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are incomplete or partially captured.

<title>MADFormer: Mixed Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformers for Continuous Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their complementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce fluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous latent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights: (1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles for future hybrid generative models.

Abstract: Creating machines capable of understanding the world in 3D is essential in assisting designers that build and edit 3D environments and robots navigating and interacting within a three-dimensional space. Inspired by advances in language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal training and performance addressing key questions related to data representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We evaluate performance across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We extend our approach to reconstruct complex 3D object shapes by enriching our 3D modality with quantized shape encodings, and show our model's effectiveness on real-world 3D object recognition tasks.

<title>Audio-Sync Video Generation with Multi-Stream Temporal Control</title>

Abstract: Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world, making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives (e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation. MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks, enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood, respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos as an inverse problem in a training-free setting. By redesigning the noise initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary modules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic inversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and resolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order Recursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this representation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the VAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions resulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which performs visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic view synthesis can be effectively performed through structured latent manipulation in the noise initialization phase.

Abstract: We introduce ZeroVO, a novel visual odometry (VO) algorithm that achieves zero-shot generalization across diverse cameras and environments, overcoming limitations in existing methods that depend on predefined or static camera calibration setups. Our approach incorporates three main innovations. First, we design a calibration-free, geometry-aware network structure capable of handling noise in estimated depth and camera parameters. Second, we introduce a language-based prior that infuses semantic information to enhance robust feature extraction and generalization to previously unseen domains. Third, we develop a flexible, semi-supervised training paradigm that iteratively adapts to new scenes using unlabeled data, further boosting the models' ability to generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. We analyze complex autonomous driving contexts, demonstrating over 30% improvement against prior methods on three standard benchmarks, KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, as well as a newly introduced, high-fidelity synthetic dataset derived from Grand Theft Auto (GTA). By not requiring fine-tuning or camera calibration, our work broadens the applicability of VO, providing a versatile solution for real-world deployment at scale.

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.

<title>Hidden in plain sight: VLMs overlook their visual representations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2) brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.

<title>Self Forcing: Bridging the Train-Test Gap in Autoregressive Video Diffusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08009</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08009</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

<title>Vision Transformers Don't Need Trained Registers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.

Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake, significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning abilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive annotation for every task, though recent works have explored training with partial task labels. Leveraging the generalization power of diffusion models, we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose 4DGT, a 4D Gaussian-based Transformer model for dynamic scene reconstruction, trained entirely on real-world monocular posed videos. Using 4D Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components, enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object lifespans. We proposed a novel density control strategy in training, which enables our 4DGT to handle longer space-time input and remain efficient rendering at runtime. Our model processes 64 consecutive posed frames in a rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference, reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods on cross-domain videos.

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells' morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However, the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models, demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant reductions in computation time.

Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia, comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp. Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720 and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in place.

Abstract: We introduce an open-source Python framework for generating synthetic ECG image datasets to advance critical deep learning-based tasks in ECG analysis, including ECG digitization, lead region and lead name detection, and pixel-level waveform segmentation. Using the PTB-XL signal dataset, our proposed framework produces four open-access datasets: (1) ECG images in various lead configurations paired with time-series signals for ECG digitization, (2) ECG images annotated with YOLO-format bounding boxes for detection of lead region and lead name, (3)-(4) cropped single-lead images with segmentation masks compatible with U-Net-based models in normal and overlapping versions. In the overlapping case, waveforms from neighboring leads are superimposed onto the target lead image, while the segmentation masks remain clean. The open-source Python framework and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/rezakarbasi/ecg-image-and-signal-dataset and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15484519, respectively.

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering, and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis. In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean, variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers, including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

Abstract: Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial, socioeconomic, building, and street-level imagery data, our framework generates Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales. Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did You Feel It? (DYFI)'' reports demonstrate significant alignment, as evidenced by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning.

Abstract: Subterranean environments such as culverts present significant challenges to robot vision due to dim lighting and lack of distinctive features. Although onboard illumination can help, it introduces issues such as specular reflections, overexposure, and increased power consumption. We propose NightHawk, a framework that combines active illumination with exposure control to optimize image quality in these settings. NightHawk formulates an online Bayesian optimization problem to determine the best light intensity and exposure-time for a given scene. We propose a novel feature detector-based metric to quantify image utility and use it as the cost function for the optimizer. We built NightHawk as an event-triggered recursive optimization pipeline and deployed it on a legged robot navigating a culvert beneath the Erie Canal. Results from field experiments demonstrate improvements in feature detection and matching by 47-197% enabling more reliable visual estimation in challenging lighting conditions.

<title>ResPF: Residual Poisson Flow for Efficient and Physically Consistent Sparse-View CT Reconstruction</title>

arXiv:2506.06400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a practical solution to reduce radiation dose, but the resulting ill-posed inverse problem poses significant challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Although deep learning and diffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical interpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative sampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image synthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose Residual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate sparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional guidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to significantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps. However, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce unrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each iteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling relies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by electrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency, resulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions. Inspired by ResNet, we introduce a residual fusion module to linearly combine generative outputs with data-consistent reconstructions, effectively preserving trajectory continuity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Poisson flow models to sparse-view CT. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical datasets demonstrate that ResPF achieves superior reconstruction quality, faster inference, and stronger robustness compared to state-of-the-art iterative, learning-based, and diffusion models.

Abstract: Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering, facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica datasets.

Abstract: Faithfully reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos presents an intriguing yet challenging problem. Significant efforts have been dedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area. Previous methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a differentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However, these approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for each scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their practicality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework, Vid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and physical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile representation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the observed configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward neural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight optimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and physical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few minutes. Additionally, after the reconstruction, Vid2Sim enables high-quality, mesh-free simulation with high efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing geometry and physical properties from video data.

Abstract: We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction, registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances. Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots, while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time, multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency, edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive autonomous systems.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However, existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have shown promise in enhancing classical neural network architectures, particularly in domains involving complex, high-dimensional data. Building upon prior work in temporal sequence modeling, this paper introduces Vision-QRWKV, a hybrid quantum-classical extension of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture, applied for the first time to image classification tasks. By integrating a variational quantum circuit (VQC) into the channel mixing component of RWKV, our model aims to improve nonlinear feature transformation and enhance the expressive capacity of visual representations.
  We evaluate both classical and quantum RWKV models on a diverse collection of 14 medical and standard image classification benchmarks, including MedMNIST datasets, MNIST, and FashionMNIST. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced model outperforms its classical counterpart on a majority of datasets, particularly those with subtle or noisy class distinctions (e.g., ChestMNIST, RetinaMNIST, BloodMNIST). This study represents the first systematic application of quantum-enhanced RWKV in the visual domain, offering insights into the architectural trade-offs and future potential of quantum models for lightweight and efficient vision tasks.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end, this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates "image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices; at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely. Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning is a promising paradigm in autonomous driving, enabling decision-making with diverse trajectory candidates. A key component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization. Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on ground-truth perception. Code will be available at https://github.com/NVlabs/GTRS.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled instruction-conditioned robotic systems with improved generalization. However, most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs' strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2 capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation. RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2 interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks, RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.

Abstract: Learning to control high-speed objects in the real world remains a challenging frontier in robotics. Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for this problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and precise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately predicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic planning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature of table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it particularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in fast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present SpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two key attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a spike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in ball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties such as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module that enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system harnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking, combined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory correction and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target area and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant performance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated tactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic control in high-speed dynamic tasks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks. Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer. These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments. We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena, CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand it better.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities across various domains. However, their ability to perform mathematical reasoning when answer options are represented as images--an essential aspect of multi-image comprehension--remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisioMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical reasoning in multimodal contexts involving image-based answer choices. VisioMath comprises 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions, where each answer option is an image, presenting unique challenges to existing LMMs. To the best of our knowledge, VisioMath is the first dataset specifically tailored for mathematical reasoning in image-based-option scenarios, where fine-grained distinctions between answer choices are critical for accurate problem-solving. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on VisioMath and find that even the most advanced models struggle with this task. Notably, GPT-4o achieves only 45.9% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current models in reasoning over visually similar answer choices. By addressing a crucial gap in existing benchmarks, VisioMath establishes a rigorous testbed for future research, driving advancements in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed, low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages, tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets, faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in \textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand. Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models. This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by 50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual, audio, and spatial cues.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance improvements in Vision-Language tasks. However, their large size poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging, particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/Div290/FREE.

Abstract: Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) represent a cutting-edge imaging technology, capable of detecting individual photons with remarkable timing precision. Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image (I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline (Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance, especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps. Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations, improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

<title>Rewriting the Budget: A General Framework for Black-Box Attacks Under Cost Asymmetry</title>

Abstract: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings, effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost) queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to 40% in some settings.

Abstract: Advances in multimodal text-image models have enabled effective text-based querying in extensive image collections. While these models show convincing performance for everyday life scenes, querying in highly homogeneous, specialized domains remains challenging. The primary problem is that users can often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation box.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) utilizes labeled samples of known classes to discover novel classes in unlabeled samples. Existing methods show effective performance on artificial datasets with balanced distributions. However, real-world datasets are always imbalanced, significantly affecting the effectiveness of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework that performs generalized category discovery in long-tailed distributions. We first present a self-guided labeling technique that uses a learnable distribution to generate pseudo-labels, resulting in less biased classifiers. We then introduce a representation balancing process to derive discriminative representations. By mining sample neighborhoods, this process encourages the model to focus more on tail classes. We conduct experiments on public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that our model exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arunshar/Physics-Informed-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model.

<title>Optimal Transport Driven Asymmetric Image-to-Image Translation for Nuclei Segmentation of Histological Images</title>

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images enables morphometric analysis of nuclei structures, which in turn helps in the detection and diagnosis of diseases under consideration. To develop a nuclei segmentation algorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations, image-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to target domain image representations. One of the important issues with image-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the information content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this regard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei structures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding space for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological image space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating judiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model develops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization framework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator automatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The proposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within the framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the image patches. The model provides a better trade-off between network complexity and model performance compared to other existing models having complex network architectures. The performance of the proposed deep generative model, along with a comparison with state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation methods, is demonstrated on publicly available histological image data sets.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images is an important task for automated computer-aided analysis of histological images, particularly in the presence of impermissible color variation in the color appearance of stained tissue images. While color normalization enables better nuclei segmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color normalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep generative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and normalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model judiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial attention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information, corresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled representation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification or loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the stain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color appearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions. The proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images. The performance of the proposed approach, along with a comparative analysis with related state-of-the-art algorithms, has been demonstrated on publicly available standard histological image data sets.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian, Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities. ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising 1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL, that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has outperformed other counterparts in sequential decision-making and dynamic environment control. However, FPGA deployment is significantly resource-expensive, as associated with large number of computations in training agents with high-quality images and possess new challenges. In this work, we propose QForce-RL takes benefits of quantization to enhance throughput and reduce energy footprint with light-weight RL architecture, without significant performance degradation. QForce-RL takes advantages from E2HRL to reduce overall RL actions to learn desired policy and QuaRL for quantization based SIMD for hardware acceleration. We have also provided detailed analysis for different RL environments, with emphasis on model size, parameters, and accelerated compute ops. The architecture is scalable for resource-constrained devices and provide parametrized efficient deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy efficiency. The proposed QForce-RL provides performance enhancement up to 2.3x and better FPS - 2.6x compared to SoTA works.

<title>Accelerating 3D Gaussian Splatting with Neural Sorting and Axis-Oriented Rasterization</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies. First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design, effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process, we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning, ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance. However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE (Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy, which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening visual grounding.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability and scalability for broader domain applications. To address this issue, recent research mainly focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while maintaining descriptive accuracy.

Abstract: We present HOI-PAGE, a new approach to synthesizing 4D human-object interactions (HOIs) from text prompts in a zero-shot fashion, driven by part-level affordance reasoning. In contrast to prior works that focus on global, whole body-object motion for 4D HOI synthesis, we observe that generating realistic and diverse HOIs requires a finer-grained understanding -- at the level of how human body parts engage with object parts. We thus introduce Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs), a structured HOI representation distilled from large language models (LLMs) that encodes fine-grained part information along with contact relations. We then use these PAGs to guide a three-stage synthesis: first, decomposing input 3D objects into geometric parts; then, generating reference HOI videos from text prompts, from which we extract part-based motion constraints; finally, optimizing for 4D HOI motion sequences that not only mimic the reference dynamics but also satisfy part-level contact constraints. Extensive experiments show that our approach is flexible and capable of generating complex multi-object or multi-person interaction sequences, with significantly improved realism and text alignment for zero-shot 4D HOI generation.

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning. Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

Abstract: Brain tumors, regardless of being benign or malignant, pose considerable health risks, with malignant tumors being more perilous due to their swift and uncontrolled proliferation, resulting in malignancy. Timely identification is crucial for enhancing patient outcomes, particularly in nations such as Bangladesh, where healthcare infrastructure is constrained. Manual MRI analysis is arduous and susceptible to inaccuracies, rendering it inefficient for prompt diagnosis. This research sought to tackle these problems by creating an automated brain tumor classification system utilizing MRI data obtained from many hospitals in Bangladesh. Advanced deep learning models, including VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50, were utilized to classify glioma, meningioma, and various brain cancers. Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies, such as Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, were employed to improve model interpretability by emphasizing the critical areas in MRI scans that influenced the categorization. VGG16 achieved the most accuracy, attaining 99.17%. The integration of XAI enhanced the system's transparency and stability, rendering it more appropriate for clinical application in resource-limited environments such as Bangladesh. This study highlights the capability of deep learning models, in conjunction with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), to enhance brain tumor detection and identification in areas with restricted access to advanced medical technologies.

Abstract: COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading and highly infectious virus which has triggered a global pandemic, profoundly affecting millions across the world. The pandemic has introduced unprecedented challenges in public health, economic stability, and societal structures, necessitating the implementation of extensive and multifaceted health interventions globally. It had a tremendous impact on Bangladesh by April 2024, with around 29,495 fatalities and more than 2 million confirmed cases. This study focuses on improving COVID-19 detection in CXR images by utilizing a dataset of 4,350 images from Bangladesh categorized into four classes: Normal, Lung-Opacity, COVID-19 and Viral-Pneumonia. ML, DL and TL models are employed with the VGG19 model achieving an impressive 98% accuracy. LIME is used to explain model predictions, highlighting the regions and features influencing classification decisions. SMOTE is applied to address class imbalances. By providing insight into both correct and incorrect classifications, the study emphasizes the importance of XAI in enhancing the transparency and reliability of models, ultimately improving the effectiveness of detection from CXR images.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and fatal diseases worldwide, demanding accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements in large AI models have significantly enhanced medical image understanding and clinical decision-making. This review systematically surveys the state-of-the-art in applying large AI models to lung cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. We categorize existing models into modality-specific encoders, encoder-decoder frameworks, and joint encoder architectures, highlighting key examples such as CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo, BioViL-T, and GLoRIA. We further examine their performance in multimodal learning tasks using benchmark datasets like LIDC-IDRI, NLST, and MIMIC-CXR. Applications span pulmonary nodule detection, gene mutation prediction, multi-omics integration, and personalized treatment planning, with emerging evidence of clinical deployment and validation. Finally, we discuss current limitations in generalizability, interpretability, and regulatory compliance, proposing future directions for building scalable, explainable, and clinically integrated AI systems. Our review underscores the transformative potential of large AI models to personalize and optimize lung cancer care.

Abstract: We present HotelMatch-LLM, a multimodal dense retrieval model for the travel domain that enables natural language property search, addressing the limitations of traditional travel search engines which require users to start with a destination and editing search parameters. HotelMatch-LLM features three key innovations: (1) Domain-specific multi-task optimization with three novel retrieval, visual, and language modeling objectives; (2) Asymmetrical dense retrieval architecture combining a small language model (SLM) for efficient online query processing and a large language model (LLM) for embedding hotel data; and (3) Extensive image processing to handle all property image galleries. Experiments on four diverse test sets show HotelMatch-LLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including VISTA and MARVEL. Specifically, on the test set -- main query type -- we achieve 0.681 for HotelMatch-LLM compared to 0.603 for the most effective baseline, MARVEL. Our analysis highlights the impact of our multi-task optimization, the generalizability of HotelMatch-LLM across LLM architectures, and its scalability for processing large image galleries.

The application automatically detects the pendulum's position via the device's camera, displaying in real time the angle-versus-time graph and estimates of the oscillation period. Experimental case studies demonstrate its effectiveness in measuring the period, determining gravitational acceleration, and analyzing damped oscillations. The results show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, confirming the system's accuracy and its applicability in educational contexts. The accessible interface and the ability to export raw data make Pendulum Tracker a versatile tool for experimental physics teaching.

Abstract: Spatial awareness is a critical capability for embodied agents, as it enables them to anticipate and reason about unobserved regions. The primary challenge arises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by sparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing methods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not generalize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \textbf{MapBERT}, a novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen spaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps aligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first time, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact bitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer missing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations. To enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking strategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with learnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object embeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more effectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical robotic tasks. Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show that MapBERT achieves state-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing computational efficiency with accurate reconstruction of unobserved regions.

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational use.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization. To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space. Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical medicine, serving as a tool for auxiliary diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring, thus facilitating physicians in the study and treatment of diseases. However, existing medical image segmentation methods are limited by the weak semantic expression of the target segmentation regions, which is caused by the low contrast between the target and non-target segmentation regions. To address this limitation, text prompt information has greast potential to capture the lesion location. However, existing text-guided methods suffer from insufficient cross-modal interaction and inadequate cross-modal feature expression. To resolve these issues, we propose the Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception network (TMC). In TMC, we introduce a multistage cross-attention module to enhance the model's understanding of semantic details and a multi-stage alignment loss to improve the consistency of cross-modal semantics. The results of the experiments demonstrate that our TMC achieves a superior performance with Dice of 84.77%, 78.50%, 88.73% in three public datasets (QaTa-COV19, MosMedData and Breast), outperforming UNet based networks and text-guided methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive capabilities across a wide range of robotics manipulation tasks. However, their growing model size poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss, its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process, a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with 4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only 29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in https://github.com/ustcwhy/BitVLA.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate highly detailed, paragraphlength image captions, yet evaluating their factual accuracy remains challenging. Current methods often miss fine-grained errors, being designed for shorter texts or lacking datasets with verified inaccuracies. We introduce DOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100 images, 14 VLMs) featuring over 10,216 sentence-level human annotations of factual correctness and explanatory rationales for errors, all within paragraph context. Building on this, we develop VNLI-Critique, a model for automated sentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight three key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization, validated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and strong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven AutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent alignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An innovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide LLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality (e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark alongside practical tools, designed to significantly elevate the standards for fine-grained evaluation and foster the improvement of VLM image understanding.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved remarkable success in reconstructing both static and dynamic 3D scenes. However, in a scene represented by 3D Gaussian primitives, interactions between objects suffer from inaccurate 3D segmentation, imprecise deformation among different materials, and severe rendering artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIG: Physically-Based Multi-Material Interaction with 3D Gaussians, a novel approach that combines 3D object segmentation with the simulation of interacting objects in high precision. Firstly, our method facilitates fast and accurate mapping from 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians, enabling precise 3D object-level segmentation. Secondly, we assign unique physical properties to correspondingly segmented objects within the scene for multi-material coupled interactions. Finally, we have successfully embedded constraint scales into deformation gradients, specifically clamping the scaling and rotation properties of the Gaussian primitives to eliminate artifacts and achieve geometric fidelity and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of visual quality, but also opens up new directions and pipelines for the field of physically realistic scene generation.

<title>Fine-Grained Motion Compression and Selective Temporal Fusion for Neural B-Frame Video Coding</title>

Abstract: With the remarkable progress in neural P-frame video coding, neural B-frame coding has recently emerged as a critical research direction. However, most existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling. By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and achieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC reference software under random-access configurations.

<title>Language Embedding Meets Dynamic Graph: A New Exploration for Neural Architecture Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications. Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress in representation learning. However, current methods still have some limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information, which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures, resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.

Abstract: Modular object-centric representations are essential for *human-like reasoning* but are challenging to obtain under spatial ambiguities, *e.g. due to occlusions and view ambiguities*. However, addressing challenges presents both theoretical and practical difficulties. We introduce a novel multi-view probabilistic approach that aggregates view-specific slots to capture *invariant content* information while simultaneously learning disentangled global *viewpoint-level* information. Unlike prior single-view methods, our approach resolves spatial ambiguities, provides theoretical guarantees for identifiability, and requires *no viewpoint annotations*. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and novel complex datasets validate our method's robustness and scalability.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity preservation.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution. Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution, producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time (0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D scene enhancement.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves competitive performance.

Abstract: Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper, we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses. Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by $7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset. SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.

Abstract: We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve training object-specific networks to compress an object.

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models (LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework. However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision (e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

Abstract: Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work, we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model, and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/boyazeng/weight_memorization.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories, thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training, offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning. GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation. Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities, paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.

Abstract: The topological analysis of four-dimensional (4D) image-type data is challenged by the immense size that these datasets can reach. This can render the direct application of methods, like persistent homology and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), impractical due to computational constraints. This study aims to estimate the topology type of 4D image-type data cubes that exhibit topological intricateness and size above our current processing capacity. The experiments using synthesised 4D data and a real-world 3D data set demonstrate that it is possible to circumvent computational complexity issues by applying downscaling methods to the data before training a CNN. This is achievable even when persistent homology software indicates that downscaling can significantly alter the homology of the training data. When provided with downscaled test data, the CNN can still estimate the Betti numbers of the original sample cubes with over 80\% accuracy, which outperforms the persistent homology approach, whose accuracy deteriorates under the same conditions. The accuracy of the CNNs can be further increased by moving from a mathematically-guided approach to a more vision-based approach where cavity types replace the Betti numbers as training targets.

<title>ComPtr: Towards Diverse Bi-source Dense Prediction Tasks via A Simple yet General Complementary Transformer</title>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has advanced the field of dense prediction, while gradually dissolving the inherent barriers between different tasks. However, most existing works focus on designing architectures and constructing visual cues only for the specific task, which ignores the potential uniformity introduced by the DL paradigm. In this paper, we attempt to construct a novel $\underline{ComP}$lementary $\underline{tr}$ansformer, $\textbf{ComPtr}$, for diverse bi-source dense prediction tasks. Specifically, unlike existing methods that over-specialize in a single task or a subset of tasks, ComPtr starts from the more general concept of bi-source dense prediction. Based on the basic dependence on information complementarity, we propose consistency enhancement and difference awareness components with which ComPtr can evacuate and collect important visual semantic cues from different image sources for diverse tasks, respectively. ComPtr treats different inputs equally and builds an efficient dense interaction model in the form of sequence-to-sequence on top of the transformer. This task-generic design provides a smooth foundation for constructing the unified model that can simultaneously deal with various bi-source information. In extensive experiments across several representative vision tasks, i.e. remote sensing change detection, RGB-T crowd counting, RGB-D/T salient object detection, and RGB-D semantic segmentation, the proposed method consistently obtains favorable performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/lartpang/ComPtr.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in medical vision-language pre-training, existing methods have largely overlooked the inherent linguistic complexity and imbalanced isssue within medical reports, as well as the complex cross-modality contextual relationships between texts and images. To close this gap, we propose a novel Entity-centered Context-aware Medical Vision-language Pre-training (ECAMP) framework, which establishes a more entity-centered, context-sensitive, and balanced understanding of medical reports to effectively pre-train the vision encoder. We first distill entity-centered context from medical reports utilizing large language models, enabling ECAMP to draw more precise supervision from the text modality. By further incorporating entity-aware re-balanced factor and descriptor masking strategies into masked languange modeling, ECAMP significantly enhances the knowledge of entities within the reports. A context-guided super-resolution task is proposed alongside a multi-scale context fusion design to improve the semantic integration of both coarse and fine-level image representations, which prompts better performance for multi-scale downstream applications. ECAMP integrates these innovations together, leading to significant performance leaps over current state-of-the-art methods and establish a new standard for cross-modality pre-training in medical imaging. The effectiveness of ECAMP is demonstrated by extensive experiments on various domains and organs, which achieves cutting-edge results on multiple tasks including classification, segmentation, and detection across 5 public chest X-ray and 4 fundoscopy datasets respectively.

Abstract: We introduce VideoPrism, a general-purpose video encoder that tackles diverse video understanding tasks with a single frozen model. We pretrain VideoPrism on a heterogeneous corpus containing 36M high-quality video-caption pairs and 582M video clips with noisy parallel text (e.g., ASR transcripts). The pretraining approach improves upon masked autoencoding by global-local distillation of semantic video embeddings and a token shuffling scheme, enabling VideoPrism to focus primarily on the video modality while leveraging the invaluable text associated with videos. We extensively test VideoPrism on four broad groups of video understanding tasks, from web video question answering to CV for science, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 31 out of 33 video understanding benchmarks. Our models are released at https://github.com/google-deepmind/videoprism.

Abstract: The domain of 3D talking head generation has witnessed significant progress in recent years. A notable challenge in this field consists in blending speech-related motions with expression dynamics, which is primarily caused by the lack of comprehensive 3D datasets that combine diversity in spoken sentences with a variety of facial expressions. Whereas literature works attempted to exploit 2D video data and parametric 3D models as a workaround, these still show limitations when jointly modeling the two motions. In this work, we address this problem from a different perspective, and propose an innovative data-driven technique that we used for creating a synthetic dataset, called EmoVOCA, obtained by combining a collection of inexpressive 3D talking heads and a set of 3D expressive sequences. To demonstrate the advantages of this approach, and the quality of the dataset, we then designed and trained an emotional 3D talking head generator that accepts a 3D face, an audio file, an emotion label, and an intensity value as inputs, and learns to animate the audio-synchronized lip movements with expressive traits of the face. Comprehensive experiments, both quantitative and qualitative, using our data and generator evidence superior ability in synthesizing convincing animations, when compared with the best performing methods in the literature. Our code and pre-trained model will be made available.

Abstract: Predicting human trajectories is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, yet current data-driven models often lack robustness in case of noisy inputs such as adversarial examples or imperfect observations. Although some trajectory prediction methods have been developed to provide empirical robustness, these methods are heuristic and do not offer guaranteed robustness. In this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for trajectory prediction that provides guaranteed robustness. To this end, we address the unique challenges associated with trajectory prediction, such as unbounded outputs and multi-modality. To mitigate the inherent performance drop through certification, we propose a diffusion-based trajectory denoiser and integrate it into our method. Moreover, we introduce new certified performance metrics to reliably measure the trajectory prediction performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the certified predictors and highlight their advantages over the non-certified ones. The code is available online: https://s-attack.github.io/.

Abstract: Recent monocular 3D shape reconstruction methods have shown promising zero-shot results on object-segmented images without any occlusions. However, their effectiveness is significantly compromised in real-world conditions, due to imperfect object segmentation by off-the-shelf models and the prevalence of occlusions. To effectively address these issues, we propose a unified regression model that integrates segmentation and reconstruction, specifically designed for occlusion-aware 3D shape reconstruction. To facilitate its reconstruction in the wild, we also introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that simulates a wide range of variations in objects, occluders, and backgrounds. Training on our synthetic data enables the proposed model to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot results on real-world images, using significantly fewer parameters than competing approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel task to evaluate the robust understanding capability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), termed $\textbf{Unsolvable Problem Detection (UPD)}$. Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is widely used to assess the understanding capability of LMMs, but it does not guarantee that LMMs truly comprehend the answer. UPD assesses the LMM's ability to withhold answers when encountering unsolvable problems of MCQA, verifying whether the model truly understands the answer. UPD encompasses three problems: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD), covering unsolvable cases like answer-lacking or incompatible choices and image-question mismatches. For the evaluation, we introduce the MM-UPD Bench, a benchmark for assessing performance across various ability dimensions. Our experiments reveal that even most LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks, struggle significantly with MM-UPD, underscoring a novel aspect of trustworthiness that current benchmarks have overlooked. A detailed analysis shows that LMMs have different bottlenecks and chain-of-thought and self-reflection improved performance for LMMs with the bottleneck in their LLM capability. We hope our insights will enhance the broader understanding and development of more reliable LMMs. The code is available at https://github.com/AtsuMiyai/UPD.

Abstract: One-shot semantic segmentation aims to segment query images given only ONE annotated support image of the same class. This task is challenging because target objects in the support and query images can be largely different in appearance and pose (i.e., intra-class variation). Prior works suggested that incorporating more annotated support images in few-shot settings boosts performances but increases costs due to additional manual labeling. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach for ONE-shot semantic segmentation, called Group-On, which packs multiple query images in batches for the benefit of mutual knowledge support within the same category. Specifically, after coarse segmentation masks of the batch of queries are predicted, query-mask pairs act as pseudo support data to enhance mask predictions mutually. To effectively steer such process, we construct an innovative MoME module, where a flexible number of mask experts are guided by a scene-driven router and work together to make comprehensive decisions, fully promoting mutual benefits of queries. Comprehensive experiments on three standard benchmarks show that, in the ONE-shot setting, Group-On significantly outperforms previous works by considerable margins. With only one annotated support image, Group-On can be even competitive with the counterparts using 5 annotated images.

Abstract: Photographing optoelectronic displays often introduces unwanted moir\'e patterns due to analog signal interference between the pixel grids of the display and the camera sensor arrays. This work identifies two problems that are largely ignored by existing image demoir\'eing approaches: 1) moir\'e patterns vary across different channels (RGB); 2) repetitive patterns are constantly observed. However, employing conventional convolutional (CNN) layers cannot address these problems. Instead, this paper presents the use of our recently proposed \emph{Shape} concept. It was originally employed to model consistent features from fragmented regions, particularly when identical or similar objects coexist in an RGB-D image. Interestingly, we find that the Shape information effectively captures the moir\'e patterns in artifact images. Motivated by this discovery, we propose a new method, ShapeMoir\'e, for image demoir\'eing. Beyond modeling shape features at the patch-level, we further extend this to the global image-level and design a novel Shape-Architecture. Consequently, our proposed method, equipped with both ShapeConv and Shape-Architecture, can be seamlessly integrated into existing approaches without introducing any additional parameters or computation overhead during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used datasets, and the results demonstrate that our ShapeMoir\'e achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in terms of the PSNR metric.

Abstract: Face recognition models are trained on large-scale datasets, which have privacy and ethical concerns. Lately, the use of synthetic data to complement or replace genuine data for the training of face recognition models has been proposed. While promising results have been obtained, it still remains unclear if generative models can yield diverse enough data for such tasks. In this work, we introduce a new method, inspired by the physical motion of soft particles subjected to stochastic Brownian forces, allowing us to sample identities distributions in a latent space under various constraints. We introduce three complementary algorithms, called Langevin, Dispersion, and DisCo, aimed at generating large synthetic face datasets. With this in hands, we generate several face datasets and benchmark them by training face recognition models, showing that data generated with our method exceeds the performance of previously GAN-based datasets and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art diffusion-based synthetic datasets. While diffusion models are shown to memorize training data, we prevent leakage in our new synthetic datasets, paving the way for more responsible synthetic datasets.

Abstract: We present a keypoint-based foundation model for general purpose brain MRI registration, based on the recently-proposed KeyMorph framework. Our model, called BrainMorph, serves as a tool that supports multi-modal, pairwise, and scalable groupwise registration. BrainMorph is trained on a massive dataset of over 100,000 3D volumes, skull-stripped and non-skull-stripped, from nearly 16,000 unique healthy and diseased subjects. BrainMorph is robust to large misalignments, interpretable via interrogating automatically-extracted keypoints, and enables rapid and controllable generation of many plausible transformations with different alignment types and different degrees of nonlinearity at test-time. We demonstrate the superiority of BrainMorph in solving 3D rigid, affine, and nonlinear registration on a variety of multi-modal brain MRI scans of healthy and diseased subjects, in both the pairwise and groupwise setting. In particular, we show registration accuracy and speeds that surpass many classical and learning-based methods, especially in the context of large initial misalignments and large group settings. All code and models are available at https://github.com/alanqrwang/brainmorph.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques have recently enabled high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. These approaches, however, are limited by the pinhole camera model and lack effective modeling of defocus effects. Departing from this, we introduce DOF-GS--a new 3DGS-based framework with a finite-aperture camera model and explicit, differentiable defocus rendering, enabling it to function as a post-capture control tool. By training with multi-view images with moderate defocus blur, DOF-GS learns inherent camera characteristics and reconstructs sharp details of the underlying scene, particularly, enabling rendering of varying DOF effects through on-demand aperture and focal distance control, post-capture and optimization. Additionally, our framework extracts circle-of-confusion cues during optimization to identify in-focus regions in input views, enhancing the reconstructed 3D scene details. Experimental results demonstrate that DOF-GS supports post-capture refocusing, adjustable defocus and high-quality all-in-focus rendering, from multi-view images with uncalibrated defocus blur.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of streamed video depth estimation, which expects not only per-frame accuracy but, more importantly, cross-frame consistency. We argue that sharing contextual information between frames or clips is pivotal in fostering temporal consistency. Therefore, we reformulate depth prediction into a conditional generation problem to provide contextual information within a clip and across clips. Specifically, we propose a consistent context-aware training and inference strategy for arbitrarily long videos to provide cross-clip context. We sample independent noise levels for each frame within a clip during training while using a sliding window strategy and initializing overlapping frames with previously predicted frames without adding noise. Moreover, we design an effective training strategy to provide context within a clip. Extensive experimental results validate our design choices and demonstrate the superiority of our approach, dubbed ChronoDepth. Project page: https://xdimlab.github.io/ChronoDepth/.

Abstract: With the emergence of LLMs and their integration with other data modalities, multi-modal 3D perception attracts more attention due to its connectivity to the physical world and makes rapid progress. However, limited by existing datasets, previous works mainly focus on understanding object properties or inter-object spatial relationships in a 3D scene. To tackle this problem, this paper builds the first largest ever multi-modal 3D scene dataset and benchmark with hierarchical grounded language annotations, MMScan. It is constructed based on a top-down logic, from region to object level, from a single target to inter-target relationships, covering holistic aspects of spatial and attribute understanding. The overall pipeline incorporates powerful VLMs via carefully designed prompts to initialize the annotations efficiently and further involve humans' correction in the loop to ensure the annotations are natural, correct, and comprehensive. Built upon existing 3D scanning data, the resulting multi-modal 3D dataset encompasses 1.4M meta-annotated captions on 109k objects and 7.7k regions as well as over 3.04M diverse samples for 3D visual grounding and question-answering benchmarks. We evaluate representative baselines on our benchmarks, analyze their capabilities in different aspects, and showcase the key problems to be addressed in the future. Furthermore, we use this high-quality dataset to train state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding and LLMs and obtain remarkable performance improvement both on existing benchmarks and in-the-wild evaluation. Codes, datasets, and benchmarks will be available at https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/EmbodiedScan.

Abstract: Urbanization advances at unprecedented rates, leading to negative environmental and societal impacts. Remote sensing can help mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, bi-temporal methods are limited for continuous urban change detection, i.e., the detection of changes in consecutive image pairs of satellite image time series (SITS), as they fail to fully exploit multi-temporal data (> 2 images). Existing multi-temporal change detection methods, on the other hand, collapse the temporal dimension, restricting their ability to capture continuous urban changes. Additionally, multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a continuous urban change detection framework incorporating two key modules. The temporal feature refinement (TFR) module employs self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. The temporal dimension is preserved in the TFR module, enabling the detection of continuous changes. The multi-task integration (MTI) module utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed framework effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution SITS acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551), Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440), and WorldView-2 (F1 score 0.543). Moreover, our experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to bi-temporal and multi-temporal urban change detection and segmentation methods.

Abstract: Infrared imaging technology has gained significant attention for its reliable sensing ability in low visibility conditions, prompting many studies to convert the abundant RGB images to infrared images. However, most existing image translation methods treat infrared images as a stylistic variation, neglecting the underlying physical laws, which limits their practical application. To address these issues, we propose a Physics-Informed Diffusion (PID) model for translating RGB images to infrared images that adhere to physical laws. Our method leverages the iterative optimization of the diffusion model and incorporates strong physical constraints based on prior knowledge of infrared laws during training. This approach enhances the similarity between translated infrared images and the real infrared domain without increasing extra training parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that PID significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/fangyuanmao/PID.

Abstract: Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) systems are central to multimodal information access, with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) showing strong performance on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse-grained annotations, limiting their ability to reveal how models perform under real-world conditions, where query granularity varies. Motivated by this gap, we examine how dataset granularity and query perturbations affect retrieval performance and robustness across four architecturally diverse VLMs (ALIGN, AltCLIP, CLIP, and GroupViT). Using both standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k) and their fine-grained variants, we show that richer captions consistently enhance retrieval, especially in text-to-image tasks, where we observe an average improvement of 16.23%, compared to 6.44% in image-to-text. To assess robustness, we introduce a taxonomy of perturbations and conduct extensive experiments, revealing that while perturbations typically degrade performance, they can also unexpectedly improve retrieval, exposing nuanced model behaviors. Notably, word order emerges as a critical factor -- contradicting prior assumptions of model insensitivity to it. Our results highlight variation in model robustness and a dataset-dependent relationship between caption granularity and perturbation sensitivity and emphasize the necessity of evaluating models on datasets of varying granularity.

Abstract: In order to unlock the potential of diverse sensors, we investigate a method to transfer knowledge between time-series modalities using a multimodal \textit{temporal} representation space for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Specifically, we explore the setting where the modality used in testing has no labeled data during training, which we refer to as Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA). We categorize existing UMA approaches as Student-Teacher or Contrastive Alignment methods. These methods typically compress continuous-time data samples into single latent vectors during alignment, inhibiting their ability to transfer temporal information through real-world temporal distortions. To address this, we introduce Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T), which preserves temporal information during alignment to handle dynamic sensor data better. C3T achieves this by aligning a set of temporal latent vectors across sensing modalities. Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets demonstrate that C3T outperforms existing methods in UMA by at least 8% in accuracy and shows superior robustness to temporal distortions such as time-shift, misalignment, and dilation. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for various multimodal applications.

Abstract: Model collapse, the severe degradation of generative models when iteratively trained on their own outputs, has gained significant attention in recent years. This paper examines Chain of Diffusion, where a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model is finetuned on its own generated images. We demonstrate that severe image quality degradation was universal and identify CFG scale as the key factor impacting this model collapse. Drawing on an analogy between the Chain of Diffusion and biological evolution, we then introduce a novel theoretical analysis based on quantitative trait modeling from statistical genetics. Our theoretical analysis aligns with empirical observations of the generated images in the Chain of Diffusion. Finally, we propose Reusable Diffusion Finetuning (ReDiFine), a simple yet effective strategy inspired by genetic mutations. It operates robustly across various scenarios without requiring any hyperparameter tuning, making it a plug-and-play solution for reusable image generation.

Abstract: Object-centric learning aims to decompose an input image into a set of meaningful object files (slots). These latent object representations enable a variety of downstream tasks. Yet, object-centric learning struggles on real-world datasets, which contain multiple objects of complex textures and shapes in natural everyday scenes. To address this, we introduce Guided Latent Slot Diffusion (GLASS), a novel slot-attention model that learns in the space of generated images and uses semantic and instance guidance modules to learn better slot embeddings for various downstream tasks. Our experiments show that GLASS surpasses state-of-the-art slot-attention methods by a wide margin on tasks such as (zero-shot) object discovery and conditional image generation for real-world scenes. Moreover, GLASS enables the first application of slot attention to the compositional generation of complex, realistic scenes.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel on fixed datasets but struggle with incremental and shifting data in real-world scenarios. Continual learning addresses this challenge by allowing models to learn from new data while retaining previously learned knowledge. Existing methods mainly rely on visual features, often neglecting the rich semantic information encoded in text. The semantic knowledge available in the label information of the images, offers important semantic information that can be related with previously acquired knowledge of semantic classes. Consequently, effectively leveraging this information throughout continual learning is expected to be beneficial. To address this, we propose integrating semantic guidance within and across tasks by capturing semantic similarity using text embeddings. We start from a pre-trained CLIP model, employ the \emph{Semantically-guided Representation Learning (SG-RL)} module for a soft-assignment towards all current task classes, and use the Semantically-guided Knowledge Distillation (SG-KD) module for enhanced knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method on general and fine-grained datasets. Our code can be found in https://github.com/aprilsveryown/semantically-guided-continual-learning.

Abstract: Text-to-image models are powerful tools for image creation. However, the generation process is akin to a dice roll and makes it difficult to achieve a single image that captures everything a user wants. In this paper, we propose a framework for creating the desired image by compositing it from various parts of generated images, in essence forming a Generative Photomontage. Given a stack of images generated by ControlNet using the same input condition and different seeds, we let users select desired parts from the generated results using a brush stroke interface. We introduce a novel technique that takes in the user's brush strokes, segments the generated images using a graph-based optimization in diffusion feature space, and then composites the segmented regions via a new feature-space blending method. Our method faithfully preserves the user-selected regions while compositing them harmoniously. We demonstrate that our flexible framework can be used for many applications, including generating new appearance combinations, fixing incorrect shapes and artifacts, and improving prompt alignment. We show compelling results for each application and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing image blending methods and various baselines.

Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) aims to synthesize a small dataset capable of performing comparably to the original dataset. Despite the success of numerous DD methods, theoretical exploration of this area remains unaddressed. In this paper, we take an initial step towards understanding various matching-based DD methods from the perspective of sample difficulty. We begin by empirically examining sample difficulty, measured by gradient norm, and observe that different matching-based methods roughly correspond to specific difficulty tendencies. We then extend the neural scaling laws of data pruning to DD to theoretically explain these matching-based methods. Our findings suggest that prioritizing the synthesis of easier samples from the original dataset can enhance the quality of distilled datasets, especially in low IPC (image-per-class) settings. Based on our empirical observations and theoretical analysis, we introduce the Sample Difficulty Correction (SDC) approach, designed to predominantly generate easier samples to achieve higher dataset quality. Our SDC can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods as a plugin with minimal code adjustments. Experimental results demonstrate that adding SDC generates higher-quality distilled datasets across 7 distillation methods and 6 datasets.

<title>ShapeICP: Iterative Category-level Object Pose and Shape Estimation from Depth</title>

Abstract: Category-level object pose and shape estimation from a single depth image has recently drawn research attention due to its potential utility for tasks such as robotics manipulation. The task is particularly challenging because the three unknowns, object pose, object shape, and model-to-measurement correspondences, are compounded together, but only a single view of depth measurements is provided. Most of the prior work heavily relies on data-driven approaches to obtain solutions to at least one of the unknowns, and typically two, running with the risk of failing to generalize to unseen domains. The shape representations used in the prior work also mainly focus on point cloud and signed distance field (SDF). In stark contrast to the prior work, we approach the problem using an iterative estimation method that does not require learning from pose-annotated data. In addition, we adopt a novel mesh-based object active shape model that the previous literature has not explored. Our algorithm, ShapeICP, is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm but is equipped with additional features for the category-level pose and shape estimation task. Although not using pose-annotated data, ShapeICP surpasses many data-driven approaches that rely on pose data for training, opening up a new solution space for researchers to consider.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a popular method for 3D generation. However, it is still challenging for diffusion models to efficiently generate diverse and high-quality 3D shapes. In this paper, we introduce OctFusion, which can generate 3D shapes with arbitrary resolutions in 2.5 seconds on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, and the extracted meshes are guaranteed to be continuous and manifold. The key components of OctFusion are the octree-based latent representation and the accompanying diffusion models. The representation combines the benefits of both implicit neural representations and explicit spatial octrees and is learned with an octree-based variational autoencoder. The proposed diffusion model is a unified multi-scale U-Net that enables weights and computation sharing across different octree levels and avoids the complexity of widely used cascaded diffusion schemes. We verify the effectiveness of OctFusion on the ShapeNet and Objaverse datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances on shape generation tasks. We demonstrate that OctFusion is extendable and flexible by generating high-quality color fields for textured mesh generation and high-quality 3D shapes conditioned on text prompts, sketches, or category labels. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/octree-nn/octfusion.

Abstract: Charts are widely used for data visualization across various fields, including education, research, and business. Chart Question Answering (CQA) is an emerging task focused on the automatic interpretation and reasoning of data presented in charts. However, chart images are inherently difficult to interpret, and chart-related questions often involve complex logical and numerical reasoning, which hinders the performance of existing models. This paper introduces VProChart, a novel framework designed to address these challenges in CQA by integrating a lightweight Visual Perception Alignment Agent (VPAgent) and a Programmatic Solution Reasoning approach. VPAgent aligns and models chart elements based on principles of human visual perception, enhancing the understanding of chart context. The Programmatic Solution Reasoning approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to transform natural language reasoning questions into structured solution programs, facilitating precise numerical and logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as ChartQA and PlotQA demonstrate that VProChart significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting its capability in understanding and reasoning with charts.

Abstract: In scientific research, charts are usually the primary method for visually representing data. However, the accessibility of charts remains a significant concern. In an effort to improve chart understanding pipelines, we focus on optimizing the chart classification component. We leverage curriculum learning, which is inspired by the human learning process. In this paper, we introduce a novel training approach for chart classification that utilizes coarse-to-fine curriculum learning. Our approach, which we name C2F-CHART (for coarse-to-fine) exploits inter-class similarities to create learning tasks of varying difficulty levels. We benchmark our method on the ICPR 2022 CHART-Infographics UB UNITEC PMC dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Audio-driven IDentity-specific Talking Head Generation (ID-specific THG) has shown increasing promise for applications in filmmaking and virtual reality. Existing approaches are generally constructed as end-to-end paradigms, and have achieved significant progress. However, they often struggle to capture high-frequency textures due to limited model capacity. To address these limitations, we adopt a simple yet efficient post-processing framework -- unlike previous studies that focus solely on end-to-end training -- guided by our theoretical insights. Specifically, leveraging the \textit{Lipschitz Continuity Theory} of neural networks, we prove a crucial noise tolerance property for the Vector Quantized AutoEncoder (VQ-AE), and establish the existence of a Noise Robustness Upper Bound (NRoUB). This insight reveals that we can efficiently obtain an identity-specific denoiser by training an identity-specific neural discrete representation, without requiring an extra network. Based on this theoretical foundation, we propose a plug-and-play Space-Optimized VQ-AE (SOVQAE) with enhanced NRoUB to achieve temporally-consistent denoising. For practical deployment, we further introduce a cascade pipeline combining a pretrained Wav2Lip model with SOVQAE to perform ID-specific THG. Our experiments demonstrate that this pipeline achieves \textit{state-of-the-art} performance in video quality and robustness for out-of-distribution lip synchronization, surpassing existing identity-specific THG methods. In addition, the pipeline requires only a couple of consumer GPU hours and runs in real time, which is both efficient and practical for industry applications.

Abstract: The differential equation-based image restoration approach aims to establish learnable trajectories connecting high-quality images to a tractable distribution, e.g., low-quality images or a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the $\textit{significant}$ superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

Abstract: The translation of Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) images is an important computer vision task. There is a significant amount of research utilizing both conventional non-learning methods and modern data-driven approaches, focusing on using both single-exposed and multi-exposed LDR for HDR image reconstruction. However, most current state-of-the-art methods require high-quality paired {LDR,HDR} datasets for model training. In addition, there is limited literature on using unpaired datasets for this task, that is, the model learns a mapping between domains, i.e., {LDR,HDR}. This paper proposes LLM-HDR, a method that integrates the perception of Large Language Models (LLM) into a modified semantic- and cycle-consistent adversarial architecture that utilizes unpaired {LDR,HDR} datasets for training. The method introduces novel artifact- and exposure-aware generators to address visual artifact removal and an encoder and loss to address semantic consistency, another under-explored topic. LLM-HDR is the first to use an LLM for the {LDR,HDR} translation task in a self-supervised setup. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark datasets and reconstructs high-quality HDR images.

Abstract: Novel optical imaging techniques, such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with machine learning-based (ML) analysis, have the potential to revolutionize clinical surgical imaging. However, these novel modalities face a shortage of large-scale, representative clinical data for training ML algorithms, while preclinical animal data is abundantly available through standardized experiments and allows for controlled induction of pathological tissue states, which is not ethically possible in patients. To leverage this situation, we propose a novel concept called "xeno-learning", a cross-species knowledge transfer paradigm inspired by xeno-transplantation, where organs from a donor species are transplanted into a recipient species. Using a total of 13,874 HSI images from humans as well as porcine and rat models, we show that although spectral signatures of organs differ substantially across species, relative changes resulting from pathologies or surgical manipulation (e.g., malperfusion; injection of contrast agent) are comparable. Such changes learnt in one species can thus be transferred to a new species via a novel "physiology-based data augmentation" method, enabling the large-scale secondary use of preclinical animal data for humans. The resulting ethical, monetary, and performance benefits promise a high impact of the proposed knowledge transfer paradigm on future developments in the field.

Abstract: The Object Navigation (ObjectNav) task aims to guide an agent to locate target objects in unseen environments using partial observations. Prior approaches have employed location prediction paradigms to achieve long-term goal reasoning, yet these methods often struggle to effectively integrate contextual relation reasoning. Alternatively, map completion-based paradigms predict long-term goals by generating semantic maps of unexplored areas. However, existing methods in this category fail to fully leverage known environmental information, resulting in suboptimal map quality that requires further improvement. In this work, we propose a novel approach to enhancing the ObjectNav task, by training a diffusion model to learn the statistical distribution patterns of objects in semantic maps, and using the map of the explored regions during navigation as the condition to generate the map of the unknown regions, thereby realizing the long-term goal reasoning of the target object, i.e., diffusion as reasoning (DAR). Meanwhile, we propose the Room Guidance method, which leverages commonsense knowledge derived from large language models (LLMs) to guide the diffusion model in generating room-aware object distributions. Based on the generated map in the unknown region, the agent sets the predicted location of the target as the goal and moves towards it. Experiments on Gibson and MP3D show the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant recognition within the deep learning community, where the fusion of the Video Foundation Models (VFMs) and Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven instrumental in constructing robust video understanding systems, effectively surmounting constraints associated with predefined visual tasks. These sophisticated MLLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in comprehending videos, swiftly attaining unprecedented performance levels across diverse benchmarks. However, their operation demands substantial memory and computational resources, underscoring the continued importance of traditional models in video comprehension tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm termed MLLM4WTAL. This paradigm harnesses the potential of MLLM to offer temporal action key semantics and complete semantic priors for conventional Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods. MLLM4WTAL facilitates the enhancement of WTAL by leveraging MLLM guidance. It achieves this by integrating two distinct modules: Key Semantic Matching (KSM) and Complete Semantic Reconstruction (CSR). These modules work in tandem to effectively address prevalent issues like incomplete and over-complete outcomes common in WTAL methods. Rigorous experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in augmenting the performance of various heterogeneous WTAL models.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel compositions of attributes and objects learned from seen compositions. Previous works disentangle attributes and objects by extracting shared and exclusive parts between the image pair sharing the same attribute (object), as well as aligning them with pretrained word embeddings to improve unseen attribute-object recognition. Despite the significant achievements of existing efforts, they are hampered by three limitations: (1) The efficacy of disentanglement is compromised due to the influence of the background and the intricate entanglement of attributes with objects in the same parts. (2) Existing word embeddings fail to capture complex multimodal semantic information. (3) Overconfidence exhibited by existing models in seen compositions hinders their generalization to novel compositions. Being aware of these, we propose a novel framework named multimodal large language model (MLLM) embeddings and attribute smoothing guided disentanglement for CZSL. First, we leverage feature adaptive aggregation modules to mitigate the impact of background, and utilize learnable condition masks to capture multi-granularity features for disentanglement. Moreover, the last hidden states of MLLM are employed as word embeddings for their superior representation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose attribute smoothing with auxiliary attributes generated by the large language model (LLM) for seen compositions to address the overconfidence challenge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging datasets. The source code will be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/Trident .

Abstract: Deep neural networks, while achieving remarkable success across diverse tasks, demand significant resources, including computation, GPU memory, bandwidth, storage, and energy. Network quantization, as a standard compression and acceleration technique, reduces storage costs and enables potential inference acceleration by discretizing network weights and activations into a finite set of integer values. However, current quantization methods are often complex and sensitive, requiring extensive task-specific hyperparameters, where even a single misconfiguration can impair model performance, limiting generality across different models and tasks. In this paper, we propose Quantization without Tears (QwT), a method that simultaneously achieves quantization speed, accuracy, simplicity, and generality. The key insight of QwT is to incorporate a lightweight additional structure into the quantized network to mitigate information loss during quantization. This structure consists solely of a small set of linear layers, keeping the method simple and efficient. More importantly, it provides a closed-form solution, allowing us to improve accuracy effortlessly under 2 minutes. Extensive experiments across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks demonstrate that QwT is both highly effective and versatile. In fact, our approach offers a robust solution for network quantization that combines simplicity, accuracy, and adaptability, which provides new insights for the design of novel quantization paradigms.

Abstract: The lack of occlusion data in common action recognition video datasets limits model robustness and hinders consistent performance gains. We build OccludeNet, a large-scale occluded video dataset including both real and synthetic occlusion scenes in different natural settings. OccludeNet includes dynamic occlusion, static occlusion, and multi-view interactive occlusion, addressing gaps in current datasets. Our analysis shows occlusion affects action classes differently: actions with low scene relevance and partial body visibility see larger drops in accuracy. To overcome the limits of existing occlusion-aware methods, we propose a structural causal model for occluded scenes and introduce the Causal Action Recognition (CAR) method, which uses backdoor adjustment and counterfactual reasoning. This approach strengthens key actor information and improves model robustness to occlusion. We hope the challenges of OccludeNet will encourage more study of causal links in occluded scenes and lead to a fresh look at class relations, ultimately leading to lasting performance improvements.

Abstract: Portrait image animation using audio has rapidly advanced, but challenges remain in efficiently fusing multimodal inputs while ensuring temporal and portrait consistency with minimal computational cost. To address this, we present LetsTalk, a LinEar diffusion TranSformer for Talking video synthesis. LetsTalk incorporates a deep compression autoencoder to obtain efficient latent representations, and a spatio-temporal-aware transformer with efficient linear attention to effectively fuse multimodal information and enhance spatio-temporal consistency. We systematically explore and summarize three fusion schemes, ranging from shallow to deep fusion. We thoroughly analyze their characteristics, applicability, and trade-offs, thereby bridging critical gaps in multimodal conditional guidance. Based on modality differences of image, audio, and video generation, we adopt deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait to ensure consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to align animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. To maintain temporal consistency in long-duration video generation, we propose a memory bank mechanism that preserves inter-clip dependencies, effectively preventing degradation across extended sequences. Furthermore, we develop a noise-regularized training strategy that explicitly compensates for DDPM sampling artifacts, significantly improving the model's robustness in continuous generation scenarios.Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency through its optimized model design with 8$\times$ fewer parameters.

Abstract: Recent advances in dataset distillation have led to solutions in two main directions. The conventional batch-to-batch matching mechanism is ideal for small-scale datasets and includes bi-level optimization methods on models and syntheses, such as FRePo, RCIG, and RaT-BPTT, as well as other methods like distribution matching, gradient matching, and weight trajectory matching. Conversely, batch-to-global matching typifies decoupled methods, which are particularly advantageous for large-scale datasets. This approach has garnered substantial interest within the community, as seen in SRe$^2$L, G-VBSM, WMDD, and CDA. A primary challenge with the second approach is the lack of diversity among syntheses within each class since samples are optimized independently and the same global supervision signals are reused across different synthetic images. In this study, we propose a new Diversity-driven EarlyLate Training (DELT) scheme to enhance the diversity of images in batch-to-global matching with less computation. Our approach is conceptually simple yet effective, it partitions predefined IPC samples into smaller subtasks and employs local optimizations to distill each subset into distributions from distinct phases, reducing the uniformity induced by the unified optimization process. These distilled images from the subtasks demonstrate effective generalization when applied to the entire task. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and its sub-datasets. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 2$\sim$5% on average across different datasets and IPCs (images per class), increasing diversity per class by more than 5% while reducing synthesis time by up to 39.3% for enhancing the training efficiency.

Abstract: Generative Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) like LLaVA and Qwen-VL excel at a wide variety of vision-language (VL) tasks. Despite strong performance, LMMs' generative outputs are not specialized for vision-language classification tasks (i.e., tasks with vision-language inputs and discrete labels) such as image classification and multiple-choice VQA. One key challenge in utilizing LMMs for these tasks is the extraction of useful features from generative LMMs. To overcome this, we propose an approach that leverages multimodal feature extraction from the LMM's latent space. Toward this end, we present Sparse Attention Vectors (SAVs) -- a finetuning-free method that leverages sparse attention head activations (fewer than 5% of the heads) in LMMs as strong feature representations. With only few-shot examples, SAVs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to a variety of few-shot and finetuned baselines on a collection of vision-language classification tasks. Our experiments also imply that SAVs can scale in performance with additional examples and generalize to similar tasks, establishing SAVs as both effective and robust multimodal feature representations.

Abstract: This paper introduces TemporalVLM, a video large language model (video LLM) capable of effective temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. At the core, our approach includes a visual encoder for mapping a long-term input video into features which are time-aware and contain both local and global cues. In particular, it first divides the input video into short-term clips, which are jointly encoded with their timestamps into time-sensitive local features. Next, the local features are passed through a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) module for global feature aggregation. The extracted time-aware and multi-level features are important for accurate temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation of TemporalVLM, we present a large-scale long video dataset of industry assembly processes, namely IndustryASM, which consists of videos recorded on factory floors with actions and timestamps annotated by industrial engineers for time and motion studies and temporal action segmentation evaluation. Finally, extensive experiments on datasets of long videos, including TimeIT and IndustryASM, show that TemporalVLM achieves superior performance than previous methods across temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding tasks, namely dense video captioning, temporal video grounding, video highlight detection, and temporal action segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to incorporate LSTMs into video LLMs.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting methods are emerging as a popular approach for converting multi-view image data into scene representations that allow view synthesis. In particular, there is interest in enabling view synthesis for dynamic scenes using only monocular input data -- an ill-posed and challenging problem. The fast pace of work in this area has produced multiple simultaneous papers that claim to work best, which cannot all be true. In this work, we organize, benchmark, and analyze many Gaussian-splatting-based methods, providing apples-to-apples comparisons that prior works have lacked. We use multiple existing datasets and a new instructive synthetic dataset designed to isolate factors that affect reconstruction quality. We systematically categorize Gaussian splatting methods into specific motion representation types and quantify how their differences impact performance. Empirically, we find that their rank order is well-defined in synthetic data, but the complexity of real-world data currently overwhelms the differences. Furthermore, the fast rendering speed of all Gaussian-based methods comes at the cost of brittleness in optimization. We summarize our experiments into a list of findings that can help to further progress in this lively problem setting.

Abstract: Articulated 3D object generation is fundamental for creating realistic, functional, and interactable virtual assets which are not simply static. We introduce MeshArt, a hierarchical transformer-based approach to generate articulated 3D meshes with clean, compact geometry, reminiscent of human-crafted 3D models. We approach articulated mesh generation in a part-by-part fashion across two stages. First, we generate a high-level articulation-aware object structure; then, based on this structural information, we synthesize each part's mesh faces. Key to our approach is modeling both articulation structures and part meshes as sequences of quantized triangle embeddings, leading to a unified hierarchical framework with transformers for autoregressive generation. Object part structures are first generated as their bounding primitives and articulation modes; a second transformer, guided by these articulation structures, then generates each part's mesh triangles. To ensure coherency among generated parts, we introduce structure-guided conditioning that also incorporates local part mesh connectivity. MeshArt shows significant improvements over state of the art, with 57.1% improvement in structure coverage and a 209-point improvement in mesh generation FID.

Abstract: Current vision-language models may grasp basic spatial cues and simple directions (e.g. left, right, front, back), but struggle with the multi-dimensional spatial reasoning necessary for human-like understanding and real-world applications. To address this gap, we develop SPHERE (Spatial Perception and Hierarchical Evaluation of REasoning), a hierarchical evaluation framework supported by a new human-annotated dataset. SPHERE systematically probes models across increasing levels of complexity, from fundamental skills to multi-skill integration and high-level reasoning that combines spatial, visual, and logical understanding. Benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant deficiencies, especially in reasoning about distance and proximity, understanding both egocentric and allocentric perspectives, and applying spatial logic in physical contexts. These findings expose critical blind spots in existing models and underscore the need for more advanced spatial reasoning techniques, driving the development of vision-language models that align more closely with human spatial cognition. The SPHERE benchmark is available at https://github.com/zwenyu/SPHERE-VLM.

Abstract: This paper presents the Visual Optical Recognition Telemetry EXtraction (VORTEX) system for extracting and analyzing drone telemetry data from First Person View (FPV) Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) footage. VORTEX employs MMOCR, a PyTorch-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) toolbox, to extract telemetry variables from drone Heads Up Display (HUD) recordings, utilizing advanced image preprocessing techniques, including CLAHE enhancement and adaptive thresholding. The study optimizes spatial accuracy and computational efficiency through systematic investigation of temporal sampling rates (1s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s) and coordinate processing methods. Results demonstrate that the 5-second sampling rate, utilizing 4.07% of available frames, provides the optimal balance with a point retention rate of 64% and mean speed accuracy within 4.2% of the 1-second baseline while reducing computational overhead by 80.5%. Comparative analysis of coordinate processing methods reveals that while UTM Zone 33N projection and Haversine calculations provide consistently similar results (within 0.1% difference), raw WGS84 coordinates underestimate distances by 15-30% and speeds by 20-35%. Altitude measurements showed unexpected resilience to sampling rate variations, with only 2.1% variation across all intervals. This research is the first of its kind, providing quantitative benchmarks for establishing a robust framework for drone telemetry extraction and analysis using open-source tools and spatial libraries.

Abstract: While existing approaches excel at recognising current surgical phases, they provide limited foresight and intraoperative guidance into future procedural steps. Similarly, current anticipation methods are constrained to predicting short-term and single events, neglecting the dense, repetitive, and long sequential nature of surgical workflows. To address these needs and limitations, we propose SWAG (Surgical Workflow Anticipative Generation), a framework that combines phase recognition and anticipation using a generative approach. This paper investigates two distinct decoding methods - single-pass (SP) and auto-regressive (AR) - to generate sequences of future surgical phases at minute intervals over long horizons. We propose a novel embedding approach using class transition probabilities to enhance the accuracy of phase anticipation. Additionally, we propose a generative framework using remaining time regression to classification (R2C). SWAG was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, Cholec80 and AutoLaparo21. Our single-pass model with class transition probability embeddings (SP*) achieves 32.1% and 41.3% F1 scores over 20 and 30 minutes on Cholec80 and AutoLaparo21, respectively. Moreover, our approach competes with existing methods on phase remaining time regression, achieving weighted mean absolute errors of 0.32 and 0.48 minutes for 2- and 3-minute horizons. SWAG demonstrates versatility across generative decoding frame works and classification and regression tasks to create temporal continuity between surgical workflow recognition and anticipation. Our method provides steps towards intraoperative surgical workflow generation for anticipation. Project: https://maxboels.github.io/swag.

Abstract: While modern visual recognition systems have made significant advancements, many continue to struggle with the open problem of learning from few exemplars. This paper focuses on the task of object detection in the setting where object classes follow a natural long-tailed distribution. Existing methods for long-tailed detection resort to external ImageNet labels to augment the low-shot training instances. However, such dependency on a large labeled database has limited utility in practical scenarios. We propose a versatile and scalable approach to leverage optional unlabeled images, which are easy to collect without the burden of human annotations. Our SimLTD framework is straightforward and intuitive, and consists of three simple steps: (1) pre-training on abundant head classes; (2) transfer learning on scarce tail classes; and (3) fine-tuning on a sampled set of both head and tail classes. Our approach can be viewed as an improved head-to-tail model transfer paradigm without the added complexities of meta-learning or knowledge distillation, as was required in past research. By harnessing supplementary unlabeled images, without extra image labels, SimLTD establishes new record results on the challenging LVIS v1 benchmark across both supervised and semi-supervised settings.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown exceptional performance in visual generation tasks. Recently, these models have shifted from traditional U-Shaped CNN-Attention hybrid structures to fully transformer-based isotropic architectures. While these transformers exhibit strong scalability and performance, their reliance on complicated self-attention operation results in slow inference speeds. Contrary to these works, we rethink one of the simplest yet fastest module in deep learning, 3x3 Convolution, to construct a scaled-up purely convolutional diffusion model. We first discover that an Encoder-Decoder Hourglass design outperforms scalable isotropic architectures for Conv3x3, but still under-performing our expectation. Further improving the architecture, we introduce sparse skip connections to reduce redundancy and improve scalability. Based on the architecture, we introduce conditioning improvements including stage-specific embeddings, mid-block condition injection, and conditional gating. These improvements lead to our proposed Diffusion CNN (DiC), which serves as a swift yet competitive diffusion architecture baseline. Experiments on various scales and settings show that DiC surpasses existing diffusion transformers by considerable margins in terms of performance while keeping a good speed advantage.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SAIL-VL (ScAlable Vision Language Model TraIning via High QuaLity Data Curation), an open-source vision language model (VLM) series achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 2B and 8B parameters. The following three key improvements contribute to SAIL-VL's leading performance: (1) Scalable high-quality visual understanding data construction: We implement a data construction pipeline to enable hundred-million-scale high-quality recaption data annotation. The resulted dataset SAIL-Caption is validated to be of the highest data quality compared with opensource datasets. (2) Scalable Pretraining with High-Quality Visual Understanding Data: We scale SAIL-VL's pretraining budget up to 655B tokens and show that even a 2B VLM benefits from scaled up training data sizes, exhibiting logarithmic data size scaling laws in benchmark performance. (3) Scalable SFT via data quantity and complexity scaling: We curate a high-quality SFT dataset collection with leading data quantity scaling effectiveness and demonstrate that training with progressively higher-complexity data surpasses baseline one-stage training by a large margin. SAIL-VL series models achieve the highest average score in 18 widely used VLM benchmarks in our evaluation, with the 2B model takes the top position over VLMs of comparable sizes on OpenCompass 2024 (https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal), demonstrating robust visual comprehension abilities. SAIL-VL series models are released at HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/BytedanceDouyinContent).

Abstract: Recent video generation models have shown promising results in producing high-quality video clips lasting several seconds. However, these models face challenges in generating long sequences that convey clear and informative events, limiting their ability to support coherent narrations. In this paper, we present a large-scale cooking video dataset designed to advance long-form narrative generation in the cooking domain. We validate the quality of our proposed dataset in terms of visual fidelity and textual caption accuracy using state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and video generation models, respectively. We further introduce a Long Narrative Video Director to enhance both visual and semantic coherence in generated videos and emphasize the role of aligning visual embeddings to achieve improved overall video quality. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements in generating visually detailed and semantically aligned keyframes, supported by finetuning techniques that integrate text and image embeddings within the video generation process.

Abstract: We propose a new continuous video modeling framework based on implicit neural representations (INRs) called ActINR. At the core of our approach is the observation that INRs can be considered as a learnable dictionary, with the shapes of the basis functions governed by the weights of the INR, and their locations governed by the biases. Given compact non-linear activation functions, we hypothesize that an INR's biases are suitable to capture motion across images, and facilitate compact representations for video sequences. Using these observations, we design ActINR to share INR weights across frames of a video sequence, while using unique biases for each frame. We further model the biases as the output of a separate INR conditioned on time index to promote smoothness. By training the video INR and this bias INR together, we demonstrate unique capabilities, including $10\times$ video slow motion, 4x spatial super resolution along with 2x slow motion, denoising, and video inpainting. ActINR performs remarkably well across numerous video processing tasks (often achieving more than 6dB improvement), setting a new standard for continuous modeling of videos.

Abstract: User interface understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) has received much attention due to its potential for enhancing software automation. However, existing datasets used to build UI-VLMs either only contain large-scale context-free element annotations or contextualized functional descriptions for elements at a small scale. In this work, we propose the \textbf{AutoGUI} pipeline for automatically annotating UI elements with detailed functionality descriptions at scale. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to infer element functionality by comparing UI state changes before and after simulated interactions. To improve annotation quality, we propose LLM-aided rejection and verification, eliminating invalid annotations without human labor. We construct a high-quality AutoGUI-704k dataset using the proposed pipeline, featuring diverse and detailed functionality annotations that are hardly provided by previous datasets. Human evaluation shows that we achieve annotation correctness comparable to a trained human annotator. Extensive experiments show that our dataset remarkably enhances VLM's UI grounding capabilities and exhibits significant scaling effects. We also show the interesting potential use of our dataset in UI agent tasks. Please view our project at https://autogui-project.github.io/.

Abstract: While diffusion models are powerful in generating high-quality, diverse synthetic data for object-centric tasks, existing methods struggle with scene-aware tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Human-Object Interaction (HOI) Reasoning, where it is critical to preserve scene attributes in generated images consistent with a multimodal context, i.e. a reference image with accompanying text guidance query. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{Hummingbird}$, the first diffusion-based image generator which, given a multimodal context, generates highly diverse images w.r.t. the reference image while ensuring high fidelity by accurately preserving scene attributes, such as object interactions and spatial relationships from the text guidance. Hummingbird employs a novel Multimodal Context Evaluator that simultaneously optimizes our formulated Global Semantic and Fine-grained Consistency Rewards to ensure generated images preserve the scene attributes of reference images in relation to the text guidance while maintaining diversity. As the first model to address the task of maintaining both diversity and fidelity given a multimodal context, we introduce a new benchmark formulation incorporating MME Perception and Bongard HOI datasets. Benchmark experiments show Hummingbird outperforms all existing methods by achieving superior fidelity while maintaining diversity, validating Hummingbird's potential as a robust multimodal context-aligned image generator in complex visual tasks.

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) leverage sparse spikes to encode information and operate in an asynchronous event-driven manner, offering a highly energy-efficient paradigm for machine intelligence. However, the current SNN community focuses primarily on performance improvement by developing large-scale models, which limits the applicability of SNNs in resource-limited edge devices. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly and lightweight SNN, aimed at effectively deploying high-performance SNN in resource-limited scenarios. Specifically, we first develop a baseline model that integrates uniform quantization and structured pruning, called QP-SNN baseline. While this baseline significantly reduces storage demands and computational costs, it suffers from performance decline. To address this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the challenges in quantization and pruning that lead to performance degradation and propose solutions to enhance the baseline's performance. For weight quantization, we propose a weight rescaling strategy that utilizes bit width more effectively to enhance the model's representation capability. For structured pruning, we propose a novel pruning criterion using the singular value of spatiotemporal spike activities to enable more accurate removal of redundant kernels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating two proposed methods into the baseline allows QP-SNN to achieve state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, underscoring its potential for enhancing SNN deployment in edge intelligence computing.

Abstract: Point cloud registration approaches often fail when the overlap between point clouds is low due to noisy point correspondences. This work introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism tailored for Transformer-based architectures that tackles this problem, by fusing information from coordinates and features at the super-point level between point clouds. This formulation has remained unexplored primarily because it must guarantee rotation and translation invariance since point clouds reside in different and independent reference frames. We integrate the Gromov-Wasserstein distance into the cross-attention formulation to jointly compute distances between points across different point clouds and account for their geometric structure. By doing so, points from two distinct point clouds can attend to each other under arbitrary rigid transformations. At the point level, we also devise a self-attention mechanism that aggregates the local geometric structure information into point features for fine matching. Our formulation boosts the number of inlier correspondences, thereby yielding more precise registration results compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We have conducted an extensive evaluation on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, KITTI, and 3DCSR datasets.

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in https://github.com/XingruiWang/Spatial457.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant approach for text-to-image generation. Key components such as the human preference alignment and classifier-free guidance play a crucial role in ensuring generation quality. However, their independent application in current text-to-image models continues to face significant challenges in achieving strong text-image alignment, high generation quality, and consistency with human aesthetic standards. In this work, we for the first time, explore facilitating the collaboration of human performance alignment and test-time sampling to unlock the potential of text-to-image models. Consequently, we introduce CHATS (Combining Human-Aligned optimization and Test-time Sampling), a novel generative framework that separately models the preferred and dispreferred distributions and employs a proxy-prompt-based sampling strategy to utilize the useful information contained in both distributions. We observe that CHATS exhibits exceptional data efficiency, achieving strong performance with only a small, high-quality funetuning dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CHATS surpasses traditional preference alignment methods, setting new state-of-the-art across various standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for generating high-quality images and videos, utilizing compressed latent representations to reduce the computational burden of the diffusion process. While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K $256^2$ and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 $17 \times 256^2$.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models enable rapid concept design, making them widely used in AI-driven design. While recent studies focus on generating semantic and stylistic variations of given design concepts, functional coherence--the integration of multiple affordances into a single coherent concept--remains largely overlooked. In this paper, we introduce SYNTHIA, a framework for generating novel, functionally coherent designs based on desired affordances. Our approach leverages a hierarchical concept ontology that decomposes concepts into parts and affordances, serving as a crucial building block for functionally coherent design. We also develop a curriculum learning scheme based on our ontology that contrastively fine-tunes T2I models to progressively learn affordance composition while maintaining visual novelty. To elaborate, we (i) gradually increase affordance distance, guiding models from basic concept-affordance association to complex affordance compositions that integrate parts of distinct affordances into a single, coherent form, and (ii) enforce visual novelty by employing contrastive objectives to push learned representations away from existing concepts. Experimental results show that SYNTHIA outperforms state-of-the-art T2I models, demonstrating absolute gains of 25.1% and 14.7% for novelty and functional coherence in human evaluation, respectively.

Abstract: While the task of face swapping has recently gained attention in the research community, a related problem of head swapping remains largely unexplored. In addition to skin color transfer, head swap poses extra challenges, such as the need to preserve structural information of the whole head during synthesis and inpaint gaps between swapped head and background. In this paper, we address these concerns with GHOST 2.0, which consists of two problem-specific modules. First, we introduce enhanced Aligner model for head reenactment, which preserves identity information at multiple scales and is robust to extreme pose variations. Secondly, we use a Blender module that seamlessly integrates the reenacted head into the target background by transferring skin color and inpainting mismatched regions. Both modules outperform the baselines on the corresponding tasks, allowing to achieve state of the art results in head swapping. We also tackle complex cases, such as large difference in hair styles of source and target. Code is available at https://github.com/ai-forever/ghost-2.0

Abstract: Perceiving visual scenes as objects and background -- like humans do -- Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aggregates image or video feature maps into object-level feature vectors, termed \textit{slots}. OCL's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from these aggregated slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. However, existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways and often fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a clean architecture -- Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO) -- that unifies mainstream OCL methods. The key to our unification is simple yet effective, just shared quantizing the same VFM representation as the reconstruction target. Through mathematical modeling and statistical verification, we further analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and how their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning. The implementation and model checkpoints are available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/VQ-VFM-OCL.

<title>From Thousands to Billions: 3D Visual Language Grounding via Render-Supervised Distillation from 2D VLMs</title>

Abstract: 3D vision-language grounding faces a fundamental data bottleneck: while 2D models train on billions of images, 3D models have access to only thousands of labeled scenes--a six-order-of-magnitude gap that severely limits performance. We introduce $\textbf{LIFT-GS}$, a practical distillation technique that overcomes this limitation by using differentiable rendering to bridge 3D and 2D supervision. LIFT-GS predicts 3D Gaussian representations from point clouds and uses them to render predicted language-conditioned 3D masks into 2D views, enabling supervision from 2D foundation models (SAM, CLIP, LLaMA) without requiring any 3D annotations. This render-supervised formulation enables end-to-end training of complete encoder-decoder architectures and is inherently model-agnostic. LIFT-GS achieves state-of-the-art results with $25.7\%$ mAP on open-vocabulary instance segmentation (vs. $20.2\%$ prior SOTA) and consistent $10-30\%$ improvements on referential grounding tasks. Remarkably, pretraining effectively multiplies fine-tuning datasets by 2X, demonstrating strong scaling properties that suggest 3D VLG currently operates in a severely data-scarce regime.

Abstract: Human activity is moderated by norms; however, supervision for normative reasoning is sparse, particularly where norms are physically- or socially-grounded. We thus present EGONORMIA $\|\epsilon\|$, comprising 1,853 (200 for EGONORMIA-verified) multiple choice questions (MCQs) grounded within egocentric videos of human interactions, enabling the evaluation and improvement of normative reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). EGONORMIA spans seven norm categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline to generate grounded MCQs from raw egocentric video. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack robust grounded norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 66% on EGONORMIA and 68% on EGONORMIA-verified, with performance across norm categories indicating significant risks of safety and privacy when VLMs are used in real-world agents. We additionally explore methods for improving normative understanding, demonstrating that a naive retrieval-based generation (RAG) method using EGONORMIA can enhance normative reasoning in VLMs.

<title>Gungnir: Exploiting Stylistic Features in Images for Backdoor Attacks on Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: In recent years, Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated significant advances in the field of image generation. However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily observed by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more susceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of backdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks by introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term Timesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images that are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both manual inspection and automated detection neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that Gungnir can easily bypass existing defense methods. Among existing DM defense frameworks, our approach achieves a 0 backdoor detection rate (BDR). Our codes are available at https://github.com/paoche11/Gungnir.

Abstract: Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made great progress in video understanding. However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \textbf{HAICTrain} comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile, \textbf{HAICBench} includes 412 manually annotated video-caption pairs and 2,000 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only significantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but can also improve text-to-video generation results. Both the HAICTrain and HAICBench are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/KuaishouHAIC/HAIC.

Abstract: Human daily activities can be concisely narrated as sequences of routine events (e.g., turning off an alarm) in video streams, forming an event vocabulary. Motivated by this, we introduce VLog, a novel video understanding framework that define video narrations as vocabulary, going beyond the typical subword vocabularies in existing generative video-language models. Built on the lightweight language model GPT-2, VLog feature three key innovations: (i) A generative retrieval model, marrying language model's complex reasoning capabilities with contrastive retrieval's flexible upgrading over narration vocabulary. (ii) A hierarchical vocabulary derived from large-scale video narrations using our narration pair encoding algorithm, enabling efficient indexing of specific events (e.g., cutting a tomato) by identifying broader scenarios (e.g., kitchen) with expressive postfixes (e.g., by the left hand). (iii) A vocabulary update strategy leveraging generative models to extend the vocabulary for novel events encountered during inference. To validate our approach, we introduce VidCap-Eval, a development set requiring concise narrations with reasoning relationships (e.g., before and after). Experiments on EgoSchema, COIN, and HiREST further demonstrate the effectiveness of VLog, highlighting its ability to generate concise, contextually accurate, and efficient narrations, offering a novel perspective on video understanding. Codes are released at https://github.com/showlab/VLog.

Abstract: Progress in 3D vision-language learning has been hindered by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. We introduce UniVLG, a unified architecture for 2D and 3D vision-language understanding that bridges the gap between existing 2D-centric models and the rich 3D sensory data available in embodied systems. Our approach initializes most model weights from pre-trained 2D models and trains on both 2D and 3D vision-language data. We propose a novel language-conditioned mask decoder shared across 2D and 3D modalities to ground objects effectively in both RGB and RGB-D images, outperforming box-based approaches. To further reduce the domain gap between 2D and 3D, we incorporate 2D-to-3D lifting strategies, enabling UniVLG to utilize 2D data to enhance 3D performance. With these innovations, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple 3D vision-language grounding tasks, demonstrating the potential of transferring advances from 2D vision-language learning to the data-constrained 3D domain. Furthermore, co-training on both 2D and 3D data enhances performance across modalities without sacrificing 2D capabilities. By removing the reliance on 3D mesh reconstruction and ground-truth object proposals, UniVLG sets a new standard for realistic, embodied-aligned evaluation.

<title>UStyle: Waterbody Style Transfer of Underwater Scenes by Depth-Guided Feature Synthesis</title>

Abstract: The concept of waterbody style transfer remains largely unexplored in the underwater imaging and vision literature. Traditional image style transfer (STx) methods primarily focus on artistic and photorealistic blending, often failing to preserve object and scene geometry in images captured in high-scattering mediums such as underwater. The wavelength-dependent nonlinear attenuation and depth-dependent backscattering artifacts further complicate learning underwater image STx from unpaired data. This paper introduces UStyle, the first data-driven learning framework for transferring waterbody styles across underwater images without requiring prior reference images or scene information. We propose a novel depth-aware whitening and coloring transform (DA-WCT) mechanism that integrates physics-based waterbody synthesis to ensure perceptually consistent stylization while preserving scene structure. To enhance style transfer quality, we incorporate carefully designed loss functions that guide UStyle to maintain colorfulness, lightness, structural integrity, and frequency-domain characteristics, as well as high-level content in VGG and CLIP (contrastive language-image pretraining) feature spaces. By addressing domain-specific challenges, UStyle provides a robust framework for no-reference underwater image STx, surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that rely solely on end-to-end reconstruction loss. Furthermore, we introduce the UF7D dataset, a curated collection of high-resolution underwater images spanning seven distinct waterbody styles, establishing a benchmark to support future research in underwater image STx. The UStyle inference pipeline and UF7D dataset are released at: https://github.com/uf-robopi/UStyle.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized video understanding, yet are still limited by context length when processing long videos. Recent methods compress videos by leveraging visual redundancy uniformly, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, our quantitative analysis shows that redundancy varies significantly across time and model layers, necessitating a more flexible compression strategy. We propose AdaReTaKe, a training-free method that flexibly reduces visual redundancy by allocating compression ratios among time and layers with theoretical guarantees. Integrated into state-of-the-art MLLMs, AdaReTaKe improves processing capacity from 256 to 2048 frames while preserving critical information. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench datasets demonstrate that AdaReTaKe outperforms existing methods by 2.3% and 2.8% for 7B and 72B models, respectively, with even greater improvements of 5.9% and 6.0% on the longest LVBench.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality and fast image generation that aligns with complex human preferences. While recent advancements in diffusion models and distillation have enabled rapid generation, the effective integration of reward feedback for improved abilities like controllability and preference alignment remains a key open problem. Existing reward-guided post-training approaches targeting accelerated few-step generation often deem diffusion distillation losses indispensable. However, in this paper, we identify an interesting yet fundamental paradigm shift: as conditions become more specific, well-designed reward functions emerge as the primary driving force in training strong, few-step image generative models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Reward-Instruct, a novel and surprisingly simple reward-centric approach for converting pre-trained base diffusion models into reward-enhanced few-step generators. Unlike existing methods, Reward-Instruct does not rely on expensive yet tricky diffusion distillation losses. Instead, it iteratively updates the few-step generator's parameters by directly sampling from a reward-tilted parameter distribution. Such a training approach entirely bypasses the need for expensive diffusion distillation losses, making it favorable to scale in high image resolutions. Despite its simplicity, Reward-Instruct yields surprisingly strong performance. Our extensive experiments on text-to-image generation have demonstrated that Reward-Instruct achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality and quantitative metrics compared to distillation-reliant methods, while also exhibiting greater robustness to the choice of reward function.

Abstract: Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal data, but their potential remains underexplored for deepfake detection due to the misalignment of their knowledge and forensics patterns. To this end, we present a novel framework that unlocks LVLMs' potential capabilities for deepfake detection. Our framework includes a Knowledge-guided Forgery Detector (KFD), a Forgery Prompt Learner (FPL), and a Large Language Model (LLM). The KFD is used to calculate correlations between image features and pristine/deepfake image description embeddings, enabling forgery classification and localization. The outputs of the KFD are subsequently processed by the Forgery Prompt Learner to construct fine-grained forgery prompt embeddings. These embeddings, along with visual and question prompt embeddings, are fed into the LLM to generate textual detection responses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including FF++, CDF2, DFD, DFDCP, DFDC, and DF40, demonstrate that our scheme surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generalization performance, while also supporting multi-turn dialogue capabilities.

Abstract: Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

Abstract: Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by proposing novel approaches such as modeling the temporal order of actions, and has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks. We will make our source code and data publicly available soon.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models often suffer from text-image misalignment in complex scenes involving multiple objects and attributes. Semantic binding has attempted to associate the generated attributes and objects with their corresponding noun phrases (NPs) by text or latent optimizations with the modulation of cross-attention (CA) maps; yet, the factors that influence semantic binding remain underexplored. Here, we investigate the geometrical properties of text token embeddings and their CA maps. We found that the geometrical properties of token embeddings, specifically angular distances and norms, are crucial factors in the differentiation of the CA map. These theoretical findings led to our proposed training-free text-embedding-aware T2I framework, dubbed \textbf{TokeBi}, for strong semantic binding. TokeBi consists of Causality-Aware Projection-Out (CAPO) for distinguishing inter-NP CA maps and Adaptive Token Mixing (ATM) for enhancing inter-NP separation while maintaining intra-NP cohesion in CA maps. Extensive experiments confirm that TokeBi outperforms prior arts across diverse baselines and datasets.

Abstract: The goal of extrinsic calibration is the alignment of sensor data to ensure an accurate representation of the surroundings and enable sensor fusion applications. From a safety perspective, sensor calibration is a key enabler of autonomous driving. In the current state of the art, a trend from target-based offline calibration towards targetless online calibration can be observed. However, online calibration is subject to strict real-time and resource constraints which are not met by state-of-the-art methods. This is mainly due to the high number of parameters to estimate, the reliance on geometric features, or the dependence on specific vehicle maneuvers. To meet these requirements and ensure the vehicle's safety at any time, we propose a miscalibration detection framework that shifts the focus from the direct regression of calibration parameters to a binary classification of the calibration state, i.e., calibrated or miscalibrated. Therefore, we propose a contrastive learning approach that compares embedded features in a latent space to classify the calibration state of two different sensor modalities. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the feature embeddings and challenging calibration errors that highlight the performance of our approach. As a result, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of detection performance, inference time, and resource demand. The code is open source and available on https://github.com/TUMFTM/MiscalibrationDetection.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork R1V, a multimodal reasoning model extending the an R1-series Large language models (LLM) to visual modalities via an efficient multimodal transfer method. Leveraging a lightweight visual projector, Skywork R1V facilitates seamless multimodal adaptation without necessitating retraining of either the foundational language model or the vision encoder. To strengthen visual-text alignment, we propose a hybrid optimization strategy that combines Iterative Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), significantly enhancing cross-modal integration efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive-length Chain-of-Thought distillation approach for reasoning data generation. This approach dynamically optimizes reasoning chain lengths, thereby enhancing inference efficiency and preventing excessive reasoning overthinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Skywork R1V, with only 38B parameters, delivers competitive performance, achieving a score of 69.0 on the MMMU benchmark and 67.5 on MathVista.

<title>A Robust Real-Time Lane Detection Method with Fog-Enhanced Feature Fusion for Foggy Conditions</title>

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing lane detection algorithms generally perform well under favorable weather conditions. However, their performance degrades significantly in adverse conditions, such as fog, which increases the risk of traffic accidents. This challenge is compounded by the lack of specialized datasets and methods designed for foggy environments. To address this, we introduce the FoggyLane dataset, captured in real-world foggy scenarios, and synthesize two additional datasets, FoggyCULane and FoggyTusimple, from existing popular lane detection datasets. Furthermore, we propose a robust Fog-Enhanced Network for lane detection, incorporating a Global Feature Fusion Module (GFFM) to capture global relationships in foggy images, a Kernel Feature Fusion Module (KFFM) to model the structural and positional relationships of lane instances, and a Low-level Edge Enhanced Module (LEEM) to address missing edge details in foggy conditions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1-scores of 95.04 on FoggyLane, 79.85 on FoggyCULane, and 96.95 on FoggyTusimple. Additionally, with TensorRT acceleration, the method reaches a processing speed of 38.4 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, confirming its real-time capabilities and robustness in foggy environments.

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning in close-set 3D object detection, existing approaches struggle with zero-shot generalization to novel objects and camera configurations. We introduce DetAny3D, a promptable 3D detection foundation model capable of detecting any novel object under arbitrary camera configurations using only monocular inputs. Training a foundation model for 3D detection is fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of annotated 3D data, which motivates DetAny3D to leverage the rich prior knowledge embedded in extensively pre-trained 2D foundation models to compensate for this scarcity. To effectively transfer 2D knowledge to 3D, DetAny3D incorporates two core modules: the 2D Aggregator, which aligns features from different 2D foundation models, and the 3D Interpreter with Zero-Embedding Mapping, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting in 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Experimental results validate the strong generalization of our DetAny3D, which not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen categories and novel camera configurations, but also surpasses most competitors on in-domain data.DetAny3D sheds light on the potential of the 3D foundation model for diverse applications in real-world scenarios, e.g., rare object detection in autonomous driving, and demonstrates promise for further exploration of 3D-centric tasks in open-world settings. More visualization results can be found at DetAny3D project page.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have revolutionized signal processing and computer vision by modeling signals as continuous, differentiable functions parameterized by neural networks. However, their inherent formulation as a regression problem makes them prone to regression to the mean, limiting their ability to capture fine details, retain high-frequency information, and handle noise effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Implicit Neural Representations (I-INRs) a novel plug-and-play framework that enhances signal reconstruction through an iterative refinement process. I-INRs effectively recover high-frequency details, improve robustness to noise, and achieve superior reconstruction quality. Our framework seamlessly integrates with existing INR architectures, delivering substantial performance gains across various tasks. Extensive experiments show that I-INRs outperform baseline methods, including WIRE, SIREN, and Gauss, in diverse computer vision applications such as image restoration, image denoising, and object occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Table structure recognition is a key task in document analysis. However, the geometric deformation in deformed tables causes a weak correlation between content information and structure, resulting in downstream tasks not being able to obtain accurate content information. To obtain fine-grained spatial coordinates of cells, we propose the OG-HFYOLO model, which enhances the edge response by Gradient Orientation-aware Extractor, combines a Heterogeneous Kernel Cross Fusion module and a scale-aware loss function to adapt to multi-scale objective features, and introduces mask-driven non-maximal suppression in the post-processing, which replaces the traditional bounding box suppression mechanism. Furthermore, we also propose a data generator, filling the gap in the dataset for fine-grained deformation table cell spatial coordinate localization, and derive a large-scale dataset named Deformation Wired Table (DWTAL). Experiments show that our proposed model demonstrates excellent segmentation accuracy on all mainstream instance segmentation models. The dataset and the source code are open source: https://github.com/justliulong/OGHFYOLO.

<title>Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification from the Perspective of the Frequency Domain</title>

Abstract: The diffusion-based adversarial purification methods attempt to drown adversarial perturbations into a part of isotropic noise through the forward process, and then recover the clean images through the reverse process. Due to the lack of distribution information about adversarial perturbations in the pixel domain, it is often unavoidable to damage normal semantics. We turn to the frequency domain perspective, decomposing the image into amplitude spectrum and phase spectrum. We find that for both spectra, the damage caused by adversarial perturbations tends to increase monotonically with frequency. This means that we can extract the content and structural information of the original clean sample from the frequency components that are less damaged. Meanwhile, theoretical analysis indicates that existing purification methods indiscriminately damage all frequency components, leading to excessive damage to the image. Therefore, we propose a purification method that can eliminate adversarial perturbations while maximizing the preservation of the content and structure of the original image. Specifically, at each time step during the reverse process, for the amplitude spectrum, we replace the low-frequency components of the estimated image's amplitude spectrum with the corresponding parts of the adversarial image. For the phase spectrum, we project the phase of the estimated image into a designated range of the adversarial image's phase spectrum, focusing on the low frequencies. Empirical evidence from extensive experiments demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms most current defense methods.

Abstract: Coronary angiography (CAG) is the gold-standard imaging modality for evaluating coronary artery disease, but its interpretation and subsequent treatment planning rely heavily on expert cardiologists. To enable AI-based decision support, we introduce a two-stage, physician-curated pipeline and a bilingual (Japanese/English) CAG image-report dataset. First, we sample 14,686 frames from 539 exams and annotate them for key-frame detection and left/right laterality; a ConvNeXt-Base CNN trained on this data achieves 0.96 F1 on laterality classification, even on low-contrast frames. Second, we apply the CNN to 243 independent exams, extract 1,114 key frames, and pair each with its pre-procedure report and expert-validated diagnostic and treatment summary, yielding a parallel corpus. We then fine-tune three open-source VLMs (PaliGemma2, Gemma3, and ConceptCLIP-enhanced Gemma3) via LoRA and evaluate them using VLScore and cardiologist review. Although PaliGemma2 w/LoRA attains the highest VLScore, Gemma3 w/LoRA achieves the top clinician rating (mean 7.20/10); we designate this best-performing model as CAG-VLM. These results demonstrate that specialized, fine-tuned VLMs can effectively assist cardiologists in generating clinical reports and treatment recommendations from CAG images.

Abstract: We propose Skywork-VL Reward, a multimodal reward model that provides reward signals for both multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. Our technical approach comprises two key components: First, we construct a large-scale multimodal preference dataset that covers a wide range of tasks and scenarios, with responses collected from both standard vision-language models (VLMs) and advanced VLM reasoners. Second, we design a reward model architecture based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrating a reward head and applying multi-stage fine-tuning using pairwise ranking loss on pairwise preference data. Experimental evaluations show that Skywork-VL Reward achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal VL-RewardBench and exhibits competitive performance on the text-only RewardBench benchmark. Furthermore, preference data constructed based on our Skywork-VL Reward proves highly effective for training Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), leading to significant improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Our results underscore Skywork-VL Reward as a significant advancement toward general-purpose, reliable reward models for multimodal alignment. Our model has been publicly released to promote transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: This paper introduces MutualNeRF, a framework enhancing Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) performance under limited samples using Mutual Information Theory. While NeRF excels in 3D scene synthesis, challenges arise with limited data and existing methods that aim to introduce prior knowledge lack theoretical support in a unified framework. We introduce a simple but theoretically robust concept, Mutual Information, as a metric to uniformly measure the correlation between images, considering both macro (semantic) and micro (pixel) levels. For sparse view sampling, we strategically select additional viewpoints containing more non-overlapping scene information by minimizing mutual information without knowing ground truth images beforehand. Our framework employs a greedy algorithm, offering a near-optimal solution. For few-shot view synthesis, we maximize the mutual information between inferred images and ground truth, expecting inferred images to gain more relevant information from known images. This is achieved by incorporating efficient, plug-and-play regularization terms. Experiments under limited samples show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in different settings, affirming the efficacy of our framework.

Abstract: The pursuit of decision safety in clinical applications highlights the potential of concept-based methods in medical imaging. While these models offer active interpretability, they often suffer from concept leakages, where unintended information within soft concept representations undermines both interpretability and generalizability. Moreover, most concept-based models focus solely on local explanations (instance-level), neglecting the global decision logic (dataset-level). To address these limitations, we propose Concept Rule Learner (CRL), a novel framework to learn Boolean logical rules from binarized visual concepts. CRL employs logical layers to capture concept correlations and extract clinically meaningful rules, thereby providing both local and global interpretability. Experiments on two medical image classification tasks show that CRL achieves competitive performance with existing methods while significantly improving generalizability to out-of-distribution data. The code of our work is available at https://github.com/obiyoag/crl.

Abstract: The automatic control of mobile devices is essential for efficiently performing complex tasks that involve multiple sequential steps. However, these tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result, current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable \emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model, executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the simulated environment. Code and demo are provided in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However, they often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens, overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model to attend to further preceding tokens, especially for video sequence tasks. With extensive experiments, FarSight demonstrates significant hallucination-mitigating performance across different MLLMs on both image and video benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the runner-up solution for the Ego4D EgoSchema Challenge at CVPR 2025 (Confirmed on May 20, 2025). Inspired by the success of large models, we evaluate and leverage leading accessible multimodal large models and adapt them to video understanding tasks via few-shot learning and model ensemble strategies. Specifically, diversified prompt styles and process paradigms are systematically explored and evaluated to effectively guide the attention of large models, fully unleashing their powerful generalization and adaptability abilities. Experimental results demonstrate that, with our carefully designed approach, directly utilizing an individual multimodal model already outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method which includes several additional processes. Besides, an additional stage is further introduced that facilitates the cooperation and ensemble of periodic results, which achieves impressive performance improvements. We hope this work serves as a valuable reference for the practical application of large models and inspires future research in the field.

Abstract: Existing methods for multimodal MRI segmentation with missing modalities typically assume that all MRI modalities are available during training. However, in clinical practice, some modalities may be missing due to the sequential nature of MRI acquisition, leading to performance degradation. Furthermore, retraining models to accommodate newly available modalities can be inefficient and may cause overfitting, potentially compromising previously learned knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Replay-based Hypergraph Domain Incremental Learning (ReHyDIL) for brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. ReHyDIL leverages Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) to enable the segmentation model to learn from newly acquired MRI modalities without forgetting previously learned information. To enhance segmentation performance across diverse patient scenarios, we introduce the Cross-Patient Hypergraph Segmentation Network (CHSNet), which utilizes hypergraphs to capture high-order associations between patients. Additionally, we incorporate Tversky-Aware Contrastive (TAC) loss to effectively mitigate information imbalance both across and within different modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2019 dataset demonstrate that ReHyDIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of over 2% in the Dice Similarity Coefficient across various tumor regions. Our code is available at https://github.com/reeive/ReHyDIL.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit visual-textual interactions to bypass safety guardrails. In this paper, we present DTR, a novel inference-time defense that mitigates multimodal jailbreak attacks through optimizing the model's key-value (KV) caches. Rather than relying on curated safety-specific data or costly image-to-text conversion, we introduce a new formulation of the safety-relevant distributional shift induced by the visual modality. This formulation enables DTR to dynamically adjust visual token weights, minimizing the impact of adversarial visual inputs while preserving the model's general capabilities and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluation across diverse VLMs and attack benchmarks demonstrates that \sys outperforms existing defenses in both attack robustness and benign task performance, marking the first successful application of KV cache optimization for safety enhancement in multimodal foundation models. (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by VLMs.)

Abstract: Large vision models (LVM) based gait recognition has achieved impressive performance. However, existing LVM-based approaches may overemphasize gait priors while neglecting the intrinsic value of LVM itself, particularly the rich, distinct representations across its multi-layers. To adequately unlock LVM's potential, this work investigates the impact of layer-wise representations on downstream recognition tasks. Our analysis reveals that LVM's intermediate layers offer complementary properties across tasks, integrating them yields an impressive improvement even without rich well-designed gait priors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple and universal baseline for LVM-based gait recognition, termed BiggerGait. Comprehensive evaluations on CCPG, CAISA-B*, SUSTech1K, and CCGR\_MINI validate the superiority of BiggerGait across both within- and cross-domain tasks, establishing it as a simple yet practical baseline for gait representation learning. All the models and code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information. However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 330 chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning, 2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13 countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants, reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap between open-source and closed-source models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/GRE.

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the large number of parameters in existing remote sensing image classification models, which hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices, this paper proposes a lightweight classification method based on knowledge distillation. Specifically, G-GhostNet is adopted as the backbone network, leveraging feature reuse to reduce redundant parameters and significantly improve inference efficiency. In addition, a decoupled knowledge distillation strategy is employed, which separates target and non-target classes to effectively enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results on the RSOD and AID datasets demonstrate that, compared with the high-parameter VGG-16 model, the proposed method achieves nearly equivalent Top-1 accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by 6.24 times. This approach strikes an excellent balance between model size and classification performance, offering an efficient solution for deployment on resource-limited devices.

Abstract: Videos are unique in their integration of temporal elements, including camera, scene, action, and attribute, along with their dynamic relationships over time. However, existing benchmarks for video understanding often treat these properties separately or narrowly focus on specific aspects, overlooking the holistic nature of video content. To address this, we introduce TUNA, a temporal-oriented benchmark for fine-grained understanding on dense dynamic videos, with two complementary tasks: captioning and QA.

Abstract: Video generation using diffusion models is highly computationally intensive, with 3D attention in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models accounting for over 80\% of the total computational resources. In this work, we introduce {\bf RainFusion}, a novel training-free sparse attention method that exploits inherent sparsity nature in visual data to accelerate attention computation while preserving video quality. Specifically, we identify three unique sparse patterns in video generation attention calculations--Spatial Pattern, Temporal Pattern and Textural Pattern. The sparse pattern for each attention head is determined online with negligible overhead (\textasciitilde\,0.2\%) with our proposed {\bf ARM} (Adaptive Recognition Module) during inference. Our proposed {\bf RainFusion} is a plug-and-play method, that can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art 3D-attention video generation models without additional training or calibration. We evaluate our method on leading open-sourced models including HunyuanVideo, OpenSoraPlan-1.2 and CogVideoX-5B, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that RainFusion achieves over {\bf 2\(\times\)} speedup in attention computation while maintaining video quality, with only a minimal impact on VBench scores (-0.2\%).

Abstract: Instance segmentation demands costly per-pixel annotations and large models. We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) framework that compresses pretrained vision foundation models (VFM) into compact experts using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three stages: (1) domain adaptation of the VFM teacher(s) via self-training with contrastive pixel calibration, (2) distillation into a compact student via a unified multi-objective loss that couples standard supervision and pseudo-labels with our instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive term, and (3) fine-tuning on labeled data to remove residual pseudo-label bias. Central to CAST is an \emph{instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask and class scores to mine informative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance margins. By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11X smaller student surpasses its adapted VFM teacher(s) by +3.4 AP (33.9 vs. 30.5) and +1.5 AP (16.7 vs. 15.2) and outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.

Abstract: Over the past 50 years, automated face recognition has evolved from rudimentary, handcrafted systems into sophisticated deep learning models that rival and often surpass human performance. This paper chronicles the history and technological progression of FR, from early geometric and statistical methods to modern deep neural architectures leveraging massive real and AI-generated datasets. We examine key innovations that have shaped the field, including developments in dataset, loss function, neural network design and feature fusion. We also analyze how the scale and diversity of training data influence model generalization, drawing connections between dataset growth and benchmark improvements. Recent advances have achieved remarkable milestones: state-of-the-art face verification systems now report False Negative Identification Rates of 0.13% against a 12.4 million gallery in NIST FRVT evaluations for 1:N visa-to-border matching. While recent advances have enabled remarkable accuracy in high- and low-quality face scenarios, numerous challenges persist. While remarkable progress has been achieved, several open research problems remain. We outline critical challenges and promising directions for future face recognition research, including scalability, multi-modal fusion, synthetic identity generation, and explainable systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning, particularly through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved multimodal large language models for complex reasoning tasks. However, two critical limitations persist: 1) they often produce unfocused, verbose reasoning chains that obscure salient spatiotemporal cues and 2) binary rewarding fails to account for partially correct answers, resulting in high reward variance and inefficient learning. In this paper, we propose TW-GRPO, a novel framework that enhances visual reasoning with focused thinking and dense reward granularity. Specifically, we employs a token weighting mechanism that prioritizes tokens with high informational density (estimated by intra-group information entropy), suppressing redundant tokens like generic reasoning prefixes. Furthermore, we reformulate RL training by shifting from single-choice to multi-choice QA tasks, where soft rewards enable finer-grained gradient estimation by distinguishing partial correctness. Additionally, we propose question-answer inversion, a data augmentation strategy to generate diverse multi-choice samples from existing benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several video reasoning and general understanding benchmarks. Notably, TW-GRPO achieves 50.4\% accuracy on CLEVRER (18.8\% improvement over Video-R1) and 65.8\% on MMVU. Our codes are available at \href{https://github.com/longmalongma/TW-GRPO}.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence, encompassing 3D reconstruction, perception, and reasoning, is fundamental to applications such as robotics, aerial imaging, and extended reality. A key enabler is the real-time, accurate estimation of core 3D attributes (camera parameters, point clouds, depth maps, and 3D point tracks) from unstructured or streaming imagery. Inspired by the success of large foundation models in language and 2D vision, a new class of end-to-end 3D geometric foundation models (GFMs) has emerged, directly predicting dense 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass, eliminating the need for slow or unavailable precomputed camera parameters. Since late 2023, the field has exploded with diverse variants, but systematic evaluation is lacking. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for 3D GFMs, covering five core tasks: sparse-view depth estimation, video depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, novel view synthesis, and spanning both standard and challenging out-of-distribution datasets. Our standardized toolkit automates dataset handling, evaluation protocols, and metric computation to ensure fair, reproducible comparisons. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art GFMs, revealing their strengths and limitations across tasks and domains, and derive key insights to guide future model scaling and optimization. All code, evaluation scripts, and processed data will be publicly released to accelerate research in 3D spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Brain tumors present a grave risk to human life, demanding precise and timely diagnosis for effective treatment. Inaccurate identification of brain tumors can significantly diminish life expectancy, underscoring the critical need for precise diagnostic methods. Manual identification of brain tumors within vast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image datasets is arduous and time-consuming. Thus, the development of a reliable deep learning (DL) model is essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and ultimately save lives. This study introduces an innovative optimization-based deep ensemble approach employing transfer learning (TL) to efficiently classify brain tumors. Our methodology includes meticulous preprocessing, reconstruction of TL architectures, fine-tuning, and ensemble DL models utilizing weighted optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithm-based Weight Optimization (GAWO) and Grid Search-based Weight Optimization (GSWO). Experimentation is conducted on the Figshare Contrast-Enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) brain tumor dataset, comprising 3064 images. Our approach achieves notable accuracy scores, with Xception, ResNet50V2, ResNet152V2, InceptionResNetV2, GAWO, and GSWO attaining 99.42%, 98.37%, 98.22%, 98.26%, 99.71%, and 99.76% accuracy, respectively. Notably, GSWO demonstrates superior accuracy, averaging 99.76\% accuracy across five folds on the Figshare CE-MRI brain tumor dataset. The comparative analysis highlights the significant performance enhancement of our proposed model over existing counterparts. In conclusion, our optimized deep ensemble model exhibits exceptional accuracy in swiftly classifying brain tumors. Furthermore, it has the potential to assist neurologists and clinicians in making accurate and immediate diagnostic decisions.

Abstract: In X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), projections from many angles are acquired and used for 3D reconstruction. To make CT suitable for in-line quality control, reducing the number of angles while maintaining reconstruction quality is necessary. Sparse-angle tomography is a popular approach for obtaining 3D reconstructions from limited data. To optimize its performance, one can adapt scan angles sequentially to select the most informative angles for each scanned object. Mathematically, this corresponds to solving an optimal experimental design (OED) problem. OED problems are high-dimensional, non-convex, bi-level optimization problems that cannot be solved online, i.e., during the scan. To address these challenges, we pose the OED problem as a partially observable Markov decision process in a Bayesian framework, and solve it through deep reinforcement learning. The approach learns efficient non-greedy policies to solve a given class of OED problems through extensive offline training rather than solving a given OED problem directly via numerical optimization. As such, the trained policy can successfully find the most informative scan angles online. We use a policy training method based on the Actor-Critic approach and evaluate its performance on 2D tomography with synthetic data.

Abstract: The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly influenced the health and everyday experiences of individuals across the planet. It is a highly contagious respiratory disease requiring early and accurate detection to curb its rapid transmission. Initial testing methods primarily revolved around identifying the genetic composition of the coronavirus, exhibiting a relatively low detection rate and requiring a time-intensive procedure. To address this challenge, experts have suggested using radiological imagery, particularly chest X-rays, as a valuable approach within the diagnostic protocol. This study investigates the potential of leveraging radiographic imaging (X-rays) with deep learning algorithms to swiftly and precisely identify COVID-19 patients. The proposed approach elevates the detection accuracy by fine-tuning with appropriate layers on various established transfer learning models. The experimentation was conducted on a COVID-19 X-ray dataset containing 2000 images. The accuracy rates achieved were impressive of 100% for EfficientNetB4 model. The fine-tuned EfficientNetB4 achieved an excellent accuracy score, showcasing its potential as a robust COVID-19 detection model. Furthermore, EfficientNetB4 excelled in identifying Lung disease using Chest X-ray dataset containing 4,350 Images, achieving remarkable performance with an accuracy of 99.17%, precision of 99.13%, recall of 99.16%, and f1-score of 99.14%. These results highlight the promise of fine-tuned transfer learning for efficient lung detection through medical imaging, especially with X-ray images. This research offers radiologists an effective means of aiding rapid and precise COVID-19 diagnosis and contributes valuable assistance for healthcare professionals in accurately identifying affected patients.

Abstract: Recent object detectors have achieved impressive accuracy in identifying objects seen during training. However, real-world deployment often introduces novel and unexpected objects, referred to as out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, posing significant challenges to model trustworthiness. Modern object detectors are typically overconfident, making it unreliable to use their predictions alone for OOD detection. To address this, we propose leveraging an auxiliary model as a complementary solution. Specifically, we utilize an off-the-shelf text-to-image generative model, such as Stable Diffusion, which is trained with objective functions distinct from those of discriminative object detectors. We hypothesize that this fundamental difference enables the detection of OOD objects by measuring inconsistencies between the models. Concretely, for a given detected object bounding box and its predicted in-distribution class label, we perform class-conditioned inpainting on the image with the object removed. If the object is OOD, the inpainted image is likely to deviate significantly from the original, making the reconstruction error a robust indicator of OOD status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses existing zero-shot and non-zero-shot OOD detection methods, establishing a robust framework for enhancing object detection systems in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Conventional diffusion models typically relies on a fixed forward process, which implicitly defines complex marginal distributions over latent variables. This can often complicate the reverse process' task in learning generative trajectories, and results in costly inference for diffusion models. To address these limitations, we introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), a novel framework that enhances diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the standard Gaussian. We also propose a novel parameterization technique for learning the forward process. Our framework provides an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective, effectively minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. Experimental results demonstrate NFDM's strong performance, evidenced by state-of-the-art likelihood estimation. Furthermore, we investigate NFDM's capacity for learning generative dynamics with specific characteristics, such as deterministic straight lines trajectories, and demonstrate how the framework may be adopted for learning bridges between two distributions. The results underscores NFDM's versatility and its potential for a wide range of applications.

Abstract: Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have led to the emergence of Vision-Language Generalists (VLGs) capable of understanding and generating both text and images. However, seamlessly generating an arbitrary sequence of text and images remains a challenging task for the current VLGs. One primary limitation lies in applying a unified architecture and the same set of parameters to simultaneously model discrete text tokens and continuous image features. Recent works attempt to tackle this fundamental problem by introducing modality-aware expert models. However, they employ identical architectures to process both text and images, disregarding the intrinsic inductive biases in these two modalities. In this work, we introduce MODALITY-SPECIALIZED SYNERGIZERS (MOSS), a novel design that efficiently optimizes existing unified architectures of VLGs with modality-specialized adaptation layers, i.e., a Convolutional LoRA for modeling the local priors of image patches and a Linear LoRA for processing sequential text. This design enables more effective modeling of modality-specific features while maintaining the strong cross-modal integration gained from pretraining. In addition, to improve the instruction-following capability on interleaved text-and-image generation, we introduce LEAFINSTRUCT, the first open-sourced interleaved instruction tuning dataset comprising 184,982 high-quality instances on more than 10 diverse domains. Extensive experiments show that VLGs integrated with M OSS achieve state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing baseline VLGs in complex interleaved generation tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong generalizability on different VLGs.

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate a variety of high-quality images by modeling complex data distributions. Trained diffusion models can also be very effective image priors for solving inverse problems. Most of the existing diffusion-based methods integrate data consistency steps by approximating the likelihood function within the diffusion reverse sampling process. In this paper, we show that the existing approximations are either insufficient or computationally inefficient. To address these issues, we propose a unified likelihood approximation method that incorporates a covariance correction term to enhance the performance and avoids propagating gradients through the diffusion model. The correction term, when integrated into the reverse diffusion sampling process, achieves better convergence towards the true data posterior for selected distributions and improves performance on real-world natural image datasets. Furthermore, we present an efficient way to factorize and invert the covariance matrix of the likelihood function for several inverse problems. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over several existing approaches. Code available at https://github.com/CSIPlab/CoDPS.

Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the Burer-Monteiro method (BM), a technique that has been applied to solve robot perception problems to certifiable optimality in real-time. BM is often used to solve semidefinite programming relaxations, which can be used to perform global optimization for non-convex perception problems. Specifically, BM leverages the low-rank structure of typical semidefinite programs to dramatically reduce the computational cost of performing optimization. This paper discusses BM in certifiable perception, with three main objectives: (i) to consolidate information from the literature into a unified presentation, (ii) to elucidate the role of the linear independence constraint qualification (LICQ), a concept not yet well-covered in certifiable perception literature, and (iii) to share practical considerations that are discussed among practitioners but not thoroughly covered in the literature. Our general aim is to offer a practical primer for applying BM towards certifiable perception.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) during ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is critical for effective treatment but remains challenging due to acoustic artifacts, small lesion size, and anatomical variability. In this study, we propose \textbf{DualSwinUnet++}, a dual-decoder transformer-based architecture designed to enhance PTMC segmentation by incorporating thyroid gland context. DualSwinUnet++ employs independent linear projection heads for each decoder and a residual information flow mechanism that passes intermediate features from the first (thyroid) decoder to the second (PTMC) decoder via concatenation and transformation. These design choices allow the model to condition tumor prediction explicitly on gland morphology without shared gradient interference. Trained on a clinical ultrasound dataset with 691 annotated RFA images and evaluated against state-of-the-art models, DualSwinUnet++ achieves superior Dice and Jaccard scores while maintaining sub-200ms inference latency. The results demonstrate the model's suitability for near real-time surgical assistance and its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy in challenging PTMC cases.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate prior to compensate for information loss due to the measurement operator is a fundamental challenge in imaging inverse problems. Implicit priors based on denoising neural networks have become central to widely-used frameworks such as Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fixed-points of Restoration (FiRe) priors as a new framework for expanding the notion of priors in PnP to general restoration models beyond traditional denoising models. The key insight behind FiRe is that smooth images emerge as fixed points of the composition of a degradation operator with the corresponding restoration model. This enables us to derive an explicit formula for our implicit prior by quantifying invariance of images under this composite operation. Adopting this fixed-point perspective, we show how various restoration networks can effectively serve as priors for solving inverse problems. The FiRe framework further enables ensemble-like combinations of multiple restoration models as well as acquisition-informed restoration networks, all within a unified optimization approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of FiRe across various inverse problems, establishing a new paradigm for incorporating pretrained restoration models into PnP-like algorithms.

Abstract: Integrating watermarking into the generation process of latent diffusion models (LDMs) simplifies detection and attribution of generated content. Semantic watermarks, such as Tree-Rings and Gaussian Shading, represent a novel class of watermarking techniques that are easy to implement and highly robust against various perturbations. However, our work demonstrates a fundamental security vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can leverage unrelated models, even with different latent spaces and architectures (UNet vs DiT), to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks. Specifically, we design two watermark forgery attacks. The first imprints a targeted watermark into real images by manipulating the latent representation of an arbitrary image in an unrelated LDM to get closer to the latent representation of a watermarked image. We also show that this technique can be used for watermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target watermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an arbitrary prompt. Both attacks just need a single reference image with the target watermark. Overall, our findings question the applicability of semantic watermarks by revealing that attackers can easily forge or remove these watermarks under realistic conditions.

Abstract: Multi-hand semantic grasp generation aims to generate feasible and semantically appropriate grasp poses for different robotic hands based on natural language instructions. Although the task is highly valuable, due to the lack of multihand grasp datasets with fine-grained contact description between robotic hands and objects, it is still a long-standing difficult task. In this paper, we present Multi-GraspSet, the first large-scale multi-hand grasp dataset with automatically contact annotations. Based on Multi-GraspSet, we propose Multi-GraspLLM, a unified language-guided grasp generation framework, which leverages large language models (LLM) to handle variable-length sequences, generating grasp poses for diverse robotic hands in a single unified architecture. Multi-GraspLLM first aligns the encoded point cloud features and text features into a unified semantic space. It then generates grasp bin tokens that are subsequently converted into grasp pose for each robotic hand via hand-aware linear mapping. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both real-world experiments and simulator.

Abstract: Our aim is to learn to solve long-horizon decision-making problems in complex robotics domains given low-level skills and a handful of short-horizon demonstrations containing sequences of images. To this end, we focus on learning abstract symbolic world models that facilitate zero-shot generalization to novel goals via planning. A critical component of such models is the set of symbolic predicates that define properties of and relationships between objects. In this work, we leverage pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to propose a large set of visual predicates potentially relevant for decision-making, and to evaluate those predicates directly from camera images. At training time, we pass the proposed predicates and demonstrations into an optimization-based model-learning algorithm to obtain an abstract symbolic world model that is defined in terms of a compact subset of the proposed predicates. At test time, given a novel goal in a novel setting, we use the VLM to construct a symbolic description of the current world state, and then use a search-based planning algorithm to find a sequence of low-level skills that achieves the goal. We demonstrate empirically across experiments in both simulation and the real world that our method can generalize aggressively, applying its learned world model to solve problems with a wide variety of object types, arrangements, numbers of objects, and visual backgrounds, as well as novel goals and much longer horizons than those seen at training time.

Abstract: Ensuring and improving the safety of autonomous driving systems (ADS) is crucial for the deployment of highly automated vehicles, especially in safety-critical events. To address the rarity issue, adversarial scenario generation methods are developed, in which behaviors of traffic participants are manipulated to induce safety-critical events. However, existing methods still face two limitations. First, identification of the adversarial participant directly impacts the effectiveness of the generation. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios, with numerous participants and diverse behaviors, makes identification challenging. Second, the potential of generated safety-critical scenarios to continuously improve ADS performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we propose LLM-attacker: a closed-loop adversarial scenario generation framework leveraging large language models (LLMs). Specifically, multiple LLM agents are designed and coordinated to identify optimal attackers. Then, the trajectories of the attackers are optimized to generate adversarial scenarios. These scenarios are iteratively refined based on the performance of ADS, forming a feedback loop to improve ADS. Experimental results show that LLM-attacker can create more dangerous scenarios than other methods, and the ADS trained with it achieves a collision rate half that of training with normal scenarios. This indicates the ability of LLM-attacker to test and enhance the safety and robustness of ADS.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop (HITL) frameworks are increasingly recognized for their potential to improve annotation accuracy in emotion estimation systems by combining machine predictions with human expertise. This study focuses on integrating a high-performing image-based emotion model into a HITL annotation framework to evaluate the collaborative potential of human-machine interaction and identify the psychological and practical factors critical to successful collaboration. Specifically, we investigate how varying model reliability and cognitive framing influence human trust, cognitive load, and annotation behavior in HITL systems. We demonstrate that model reliability and psychological framing significantly impact annotators' trust, engagement, and consistency, offering insights into optimizing HITL frameworks. Through three experimental scenarios with 29 participants--baseline model reliability (S1), fabricated errors (S2), and cognitive bias introduced by negative framing (S3)--we analyzed behavioral and qualitative data. Reliable predictions in S1 yielded high trust and annotation consistency, while unreliable outputs in S2 led to increased critical evaluations but also heightened frustration and response variability. Negative framing in S3 revealed how cognitive bias influenced participants to perceive the model as more relatable and accurate, despite misinformation regarding its reliability. These findings highlight the importance of both reliable machine outputs and psychological factors in shaping effective human-machine collaboration. By leveraging the strengths of both human oversight and automated systems, this study establishes a scalable HITL framework for emotion annotation and lays the foundation for broader applications in adaptive learning and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Progress in AI has relied on human-generated data, from annotator marketplaces to the wider Internet. However, the widespread use of large language models now threatens the quality and integrity of human-generated data on these very platforms. We argue that this issue goes beyond the immediate challenge of filtering AI-generated content -- it reveals deeper flaws in how data collection systems are designed. Existing systems often prioritize speed, scale, and efficiency at the cost of intrinsic human motivation, leading to declining engagement and data quality. We propose that rethinking data collection systems to align with contributors' intrinsic motivations -- rather than relying solely on external incentives -- can help sustain high-quality data sourcing at scale while maintaining contributor trust and long-term participation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are renowned for their superior instruction-following and reasoning capabilities across diverse problem domains. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on assessing factual and logical correctness in downstream tasks, with limited emphasis on evaluating MLLMs' ability to interpret pragmatic cues and intermodal relationships. To address this gap, we assess the competency of MLLMs in performing Multimodal Discourse Analysis (MDA) using Coherence Relations. Our benchmark, CORDIAL, encompasses a broad spectrum of Coherence Relations across 3 different discourse domains at varying levels of granularity. Through our experiments on 10+ MLLMs employing different prompting strategies, we show that even top models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o fail to match the performance of simple classifier-based baselines. This study emphasizes the need to move beyond similarity-based metrics and adopt a discourse-driven framework for evaluating MLLMs, providing a more nuanced assessment of their capabilities. The benchmark and code are available at: https://aashish2000.github.io/CORDIAL/

<title>Stop Looking for Important Tokens in Multimodal Language Models: Duplication Matters More</title>

Abstract: Vision tokens in multimodal large language models often dominate huge computational overhead due to their excessive length compared to linguistic modality. Abundant recent methods aim to solve this problem with token pruning, which first defines an importance criterion for tokens and then prunes the unimportant vision tokens during inference. However, in this paper, we show that the importance is not an ideal indicator to decide whether a token should be pruned. Surprisingly, it usually results in inferior performance than random token pruning and leading to incompatibility to efficient attention computation operators.Instead, we propose DART (Duplication-Aware Reduction of Tokens), which prunes tokens based on its duplication with other tokens, leading to significant and training-free acceleration. Concretely, DART selects a small subset of pivot tokens and then retains the tokens with low duplication to the pivots, ensuring minimal information loss during token pruning. Experiments demonstrate that DART can prune 88.9% vision tokens while maintaining comparable performance, leading to a 1.99$\times$ and 2.99$\times$ speed-up in total time and prefilling stage, respectively, with good compatibility to efficient attention operators. Our codes are available at https://github.com/ZichenWen1/DART.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a large model-driven framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image semantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information among tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) have gained prominence for efficiently encoding multimedia data, yet their applications in audio signals remain limited. This study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a novel architecture using learnable activation functions, as an effective INR model for audio representation. KAN demonstrates superior perceptual performance over previous INRs, achieving the lowest Log-SpectralDistance of 1.29 and the highest Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality of 3.57 for 1.5 s audio. To extend KAN's utility, we propose FewSound, a hypernetwork-based architecture that enhances INR parameter updates. FewSound outperforms the state-of-the-art HyperSound, with a 33.3% improvement in MSE and 60.87% in SI-SNR. These results show KAN as a robust and adaptable audio representation with the potential for scalability and integration into various hypernetwork frameworks.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) leverages abundant unlabeled data alongside limited labeled data to enhance learning. As vision foundation models (VFMs) increasingly serve as the backbone of vision applications, it remains unclear how SSL interacts with these pre-trained models. To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models.

Abstract: Writing Assistants (e.g., Grammarly, Microsoft Copilot) traditionally generate diverse image captions by employing syntactic and semantic variations to describe image components. However, human-written captions prioritize conveying a central message alongside visual descriptions using pragmatic cues. To enhance caption diversity, it is essential to explore alternative ways of communicating these messages in conjunction with visual content. We propose RONA, a novel prompting strategy for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) that leverages Coherence Relations as a controllable axis for pragmatic variations. We demonstrate that RONA generates captions with better overall diversity and ground-truth alignment, compared to MLLM baselines across multiple domains.

Abstract: Multimodal alignment constructs a joint latent vector space where modalities representing the same concept map to neighboring latent vectors. We formulate this as an inverse problem and show that, under certain conditions, paired data from each modality can map to equivalent latent vectors, which we refer to as perfect alignment. When perfect alignment cannot be achieved, it can be approximated using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a multimodal data matrix. Experiments on synthetic multimodal Gaussian data verify the effectiveness of our perfect alignment method compared to a learned contrastive alignment method. We further demonstrate the practical application of cross-modal transfer for human action recognition, showing that perfect alignment significantly enhances the model's accuracy. We conclude by discussing how these findings can be applied to various modalities and tasks and the limitations of our method. We hope these findings inspire further exploration of perfect alignment and its applications in representation learning.

Abstract: We present SOPHY, a generative model for 3D physics-aware shape synthesis. Unlike existing 3D generative models that focus solely on static geometry or 4D models that produce physics-agnostic animations, our method jointly synthesizes shape, texture, and material properties related to physics-grounded dynamics, making the generated objects ready for simulations and interactive, dynamic environments. To train our model, we introduce a dataset of 3D objects annotated with detailed physical material attributes, along with an efficient pipeline for material annotation. Our method enables applications such as text-driven generation of interactive, physics-aware 3D objects and single-image reconstruction of physically plausible shapes. Furthermore, our experiments show that jointly modeling shape and material properties enhances the realism and fidelity of the generated shapes, improving performance on both generative geometry and physical plausibility.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, labelled retinal imaging data, which presents a significant challenge in the development of machine learning models for ophthalmology, hinders progress in the field. To synthesise Colour Fundus Photographs (CFPs), existing methods primarily relying on predefined disease labels face significant limitations. However, current methods remain limited, thus failing to generate images for broader categories with diverse and fine-grained anatomical structures. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, synthetic Caption-CFP dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k. Specifically, RetinaLogos-1400k uses large language models (LLMs) to describe retinal conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration, vascular distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features. Furthermore, based on this dataset, we employ a novel three-step training framework, called RetinaLogos, which enables fine-grained semantic control over retinal images and accurately captures different stages of disease progression, subtle anatomical variations, and specific lesion types. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07% of text-driven synthetic images indistinguishable from real ones by ophthalmologists. Moreover, the synthetic data improves accuracy by 10%-25% in diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection, thereby providing a scalable solution to augment ophthalmic datasets.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across various visual tasks, yet they remain hindered by the persistent challenge of hallucinations. To address this critical issue, we propose Mixture of Decoding (MoD), a novel approach for hallucination mitigation that dynamically adapts decoding strategies by evaluating the correctness of the model's attention on image tokens. Specifically, MoD measures the consistency between outputs generated from the original image tokens and those derived from the model's attended image tokens, to distinguish the correctness aforementioned. If the outputs are consistent, indicating correct attention, MoD employs a complementary strategy to amplify critical information. Conversely, if the outputs are inconsistent, suggesting erroneous attention, MoD utilizes a contrastive strategy to suppress misleading information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoD significantly outperforms existing decoding methods across multiple mainstream benchmarks, effectively mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/xlchen0205/MoD.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of large-scale urban scenes is critical for applications such as AR navigation, UAV based inspection, and smart city digital twins. While aerial imagery offers broad coverage and complements limitations of ground-based data, reconstructing city-scale environments from such views remains challenging due to occlusions, incomplete geometry, and high memory demands. Recent advances like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) improve scalability and visual quality but remain limited by dense primitive usage, long training times, and poor suit ability for edge devices. We propose CityGo, a hybrid framework that combines textured proxy geometry with residual and surrounding 3D Gaussians for lightweight, photorealistic rendering of urban scenes from aerial perspectives. Our approach first extracts compact building proxy meshes from MVS point clouds, then uses zero order SH Gaussians to generate occlusion-free textures via image-based rendering and back-projection. To capture high-frequency details, we introduce residual Gaussians placed based on proxy-photo discrepancies and guided by depth priors. Broader urban context is represented by surrounding Gaussians, with importance-aware downsampling applied to non-critical regions to reduce redundancy. A tailored optimization strategy jointly refines proxy textures and Gaussian parameters, enabling real-time rendering of complex urban scenes on mobile GPUs with significantly reduced training and memory requirements. Extensive experiments on real-world aerial datasets demonstrate that our hybrid representation significantly reduces training time, achieving on average 1.4x speedup, while delivering comparable visual fidelity to pure 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches. Furthermore, CityGo enables real-time rendering of large-scale urban scenes on mobile consumer GPUs, with substantially reduced memory usage and energy consumption.

Summary: <br />
In this paper, the authors address bias in face recognition models, specifically focusing on data bias related to ethnicity labels. They propose a new approach of treating ethnicity labels as a continuous variable rather than a discrete value for each identity. Through experimental and theoretical validation, they demonstrate that not all identities within the same ethnicity contribute equally to dataset balance. By training models on datasets balanced in the continuous space, they consistently achieve better performance compared to models trained on datasets balanced in the discrete space. The authors conducted extensive experiments, training over 65 different models and creating more than 20 subsets of the original datasets. This novel approach offers valuable insights into improving the balance and performance of face recognition models, with implications for addressing bias in AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Bias has been a constant in face recognition models. Over the years, researchers have looked at it from both the model and the data point of view. However, their approach to mitigation of data bias was limited and lacked insight on the real nature of the problem. Here, in this document, we propose to revise our use of ethnicity labels as a continuous variable instead of a discrete value per identity. We validate our formulation both experimentally and theoretically, showcasing that not all identities from one ethnicity contribute equally to the balance of the dataset; thus, having the same number of identities per ethnicity does not represent a balanced dataset. We further show that models trained on datasets balanced in the continuous space consistently outperform models trained on data balanced in the discrete space. We trained more than 65 different models, and created more than 20 subsets of the original datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics, specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies: Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR) dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates (10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones.

Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline across multiple metrics.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore, we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Summary: 
Counterfeiting of images and videos is becoming a widespread issue on online platforms, leading to the dissemination of false information and potential misuse for criminal activities. Existing detection methods are insufficient in keeping up with evolving counterfeiting techniques, such as the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). This study introduces an independent discriminant network based on a convolutional neural network to identify GAN-generated content. The proposed platform allows users to detect forged images and videos, aiding in the identification of counterfeit materials and hidden criminal evidence. By utilizing advanced technology to combat digital manipulation, this work aims to contribute to the field of forensic analysis and enhance efforts in combating the spread of misleading and fraudulent content online. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an image using various editing software which are readily available. This generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network has been created using a convolutional neural network based on InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence towards the identification of criminal activities.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part of the national security and provide the most valuable service during surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals, there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge. Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet, leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task.

<br />
Summary: 
This study introduces a unified two-stage training framework for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance visual quality assessment. The framework includes a cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage. In the first stage, high-quality data is distilled from a teacher model to initialize reasoning capabilities. In the second stage, a novel reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization is used to optimize scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. The models derived from these stages, Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder, achieve state-of-the-art performance on quality score regression benchmarks, outperforming description-based models. Q-Ponder demonstrates higher accuracy and reasonableness in descriptions compared to its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, showcasing generalization potential across diverse tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments. However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability. This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing. To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage. Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization potential over diverse tasks.

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space, deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

<div> Keywords: object segmentation, complex shapes, Talk2SAM, natural language guidance, semantic regions<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces Talk2SAM, a novel approach that enhances object segmentation models by integrating textual guidance. Talk2SAM uses CLIP-based embeddings from user-provided text prompts to identify relevant semantic regions and improve segmentation of complex shapes like wires and bicycles. By projecting these features into the DINO feature space, Talk2SAM provides additional prompts to the SAM-HQ model, improving its focus on target objects. The method allows for user-controllable segmentation and disambiguation within a single bounding box based on textual input. Evaluation on three benchmarks shows that Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving significant improvements in intersection over union and boundary intersection over union metrics. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating natural language guidance for precise object segmentation where traditional methods struggle. The source code for Talk2SAM is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries, leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ, enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K. Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\% boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods fail.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy, with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment workflows.

<div> keywords: vision pretraining, object-level self-distillation, object-aware cropping, masked attention, transformer

Summary:
Object-level Self-DIStillation (ODIS) is a new approach for vision pretraining that focuses on individual objects rather than whole images. By using object-aware cropping and masked attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions and guides the transformer towards semantically meaningful content. This shift in granularity from scene-level to object-level sub-tasks improves visual representations at both the image and patch levels. The method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on ImageNet1k when using masks at inference time, demonstrating the effectiveness of ODIS in transforming a noisy, scene-centric task into simpler object-centric tasks. The ODIS approach addresses the limitations of current vision pretraining methods by better capturing the complexity of real-world scenes and multiple objects within images.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity. We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation (ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

<br />
Summary: 
In a study involving 111 Vision Language Models (VLMs), researchers evaluated their ability to infer what others are looking at, a crucial skill for human-AI interaction. The VLMs performed poorly, as 94 out of 111 models were unable to surpass random guessing, unlike human participants who achieved near-perfect accuracy. Behavioral analysis revealed that the top-performing VLMs showed decreasing performance with higher task difficulty but consistent performance across different prompts and scene objects, indicating the use of heuristics rather than random guessing. While VLMs currently lack gaze inference capabilities necessary for natural interaction with humans, there is potential for improvement in the future. <div>

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65), and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111 VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential remains.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. It addresses the lack of exploration in this area by existing models and benchmarks, which focus mainly on static or 2D scenes. The benchmark consists of relationships involving static and moving objects, requiring fine-grained temporal grounding, 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. The proposed SAVVY reasoning pipeline comprises two stages: Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation and Dynamic Global Map Construction. By leveraging AV-LLMs and audio-visual methods, SAVVY tracks object trajectories and constructs a dynamic global map for 3D spatial reasoning. Empirical evaluation shows that SAVVY significantly improves the performance of existing AV-LLMs, setting a new standard for dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in audio-visual environments. <div>

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Summary:
Boundary representation (B-rep) data from computer-aided design (CAD) is commonly used in industry, but its STEP format limits its accessibility in large learning pipelines due to high licensing costs for CAD kernels. This paper introduces an alternative format based on HDF5 and a dataset for STEP files, along with an open-source Python library for processing them. Standard functionalities like sampling, normals, and curvature are provided to facilitate integration into existing pipelines. The Fusion 360 and ABC datasets were converted to demonstrate the format's effectiveness. Four standard use cases – normal estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation – were developed to test the integrity and compliance of the data with the original STEP files. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360 dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

Summary: 
The study introduces a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method for efficient and robust representation learning in vision-based reinforcement learning tasks. SPD tackles distractions like shadows, clouds, and light in images, even when unseen during training. By using weak and strong augmentations concurrently, SPD learns task-relevant features by predicting inverse and forward transitions across these augmented versions. The method demonstrates superior performance in MuJoCo visual control tasks and a CARLA autonomous driving task compared to prior studies in handling complex image observations and improving generalization to unseen data.

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training. We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly improves the generalization performance for unseen observations.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method, Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/JeongsooHa/DrG.git

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new approach for Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE) using Radio Frequency (RF) signals. The proposed one-stage MPPE model is efficient and lightweight, achieving higher accuracy compared to existing methods. By subgrouping RF signals and utilizing a shared single-layer CNN with multi-head attention, the model outperforms previous approaches. Additionally, a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) method is introduced, which enhances performance when faced with new locations or obstacles. Experimental results show a significant improvement in MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in PCKh@0.5. The proposed SSL method further boosts performance gains, especially in scenarios with multiple individuals. The code and dataset for this study are publicly available on Github, allowing for further research and development in the field of RF-based MPPE. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency (RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas, contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

The benchmark consists of 2,792 video clips and 8,792 question-answer pairs collected from TikTok and YouTube, testing models' abilities to understand social interactions.

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR), and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and 8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI.

A new approach for evaluating the robustness of vision-language models is proposed in this work. A generic surrogate model is trained to generate joint representations from both image and text inputs, enabling the generation of coordinated adversarial perturbations for both modalities. This coordinated attack strategy outperforms other multi-modal and single-modality attacks in compromising the robustness of state-of-the-art pre-trained vision-language models. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on visual question answering and visual reasoning datasets, showcasing its impact on models like instruct-BLIP and ViLT.

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

The article introduces a novel approach using multi-agent reinforcement learning for evaluating the robustness of video classification models. The challenge lies in minimizing perturbations while inducing misclassification due to the increased complexity and computational cost of video models. By incorporating spatial and temporal agents that consider temporal coherence, the approach effectively identifies sensitive regions in videos with visually imperceptible attacks. The method surpasses existing solutions in metrics like Lp and average queries, offering customizable distortion types for more relevant robustness evaluations. Extensive testing on popular video action recognition models on HMDB-51 and UCF-101 datasets shows promising results, establishing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging, specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Summary:<br />
The study explores the role of CLIP visual representations in vision-language models (VLMs). It suggests that while CLIP may have limitations, the language decoder in VLMs can compensate for weak visual features. By conducting self-attention ablations on three CLIP-based VLMs, the researchers found that the language backbone enriches the visual information provided by CLIP. Even when visual representations lack contextualization, the language decoder can make up for it and maintain performance. This dynamic division of labor highlights the potential for future VLM architectures to delegate more visual processing tasks to the language decoder. <div>
arXiv:2506.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language decoder.

<div> Keywords: Visual Language Models, Evaluation Methodology, Synthetic Images, Perception Failures, Fine-grained Analysis

Summary:
Visual Language Models (VLMs) have evolved to support various applications but evaluating them on specific benchmarks with real images and pre-defined questions can be costly and may not pinpoint the source of failures. To address this, a new evaluation methodology inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics is proposed. This approach involves generating synthetic images with controlled variation in specific attributes, allowing for systematic testing and detailed analysis of perception failures in VLMs. By focusing on fine-grained assessment, this methodology shifts the evaluation focus from aggregate scores to targeted evaluation of VLM capabilities. The code for this methodology is openly available on GitHub, facilitating further research in this area. This new approach provides a more comprehensive and interpretable evaluation of VLMs, enabling researchers to understand the specific limitations and strengths of these models in handling visual tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However, such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception, reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology, inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant. This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However, troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with 0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20% accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally, ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g., weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is vital for various remote sensing applications, especially water body detection. Deep learning models, like U-Net and SegNet, often struggle with convergence speed and stability due to the complex statistical distribution of SAR data. This study investigates the impact of mode normalization on these models and finds that integrating normalization significantly accelerates convergence, maintaining baseline model performance.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically, we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore, cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR image segmentation.

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications, affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A) super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B) reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation (high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, image manipulation, image editing, RADAR, benchmark

Summary:
The article introduces RADAR, a novel approach for identifying changes made to authentic images using diffusion models. By combining features from different image modalities and incorporating an auxiliary contrastive loss, RADAR significantly improves accuracy and generalization to various diffusion models. A new benchmark, BBC-PAIR, is introduced to evaluate the method's performance on images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Results show that RADAR outperforms existing methods in detecting and localizing image edits by both seen and unseen diffusion models. The code, data, and models for RADAR will be publicly available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code, data and models will be publicly available at alex-costanzino.github.io/radar.

Summary:
- The paper introduces a new approach for 3D occupancy prediction using sparse query-based representations.
- Unlike existing methods relying on dense representations, the proposed framework summarizes the scene into a set of 3D queries that are propagated through time in a streaming fashion.
- These queries are decoded into semantic Gaussians at each timestep and guided by a denoising rendering objective to effectively capture scene geometry.
- The new method, named S2GO, outperforms prior art like GaussianWorld on nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, achieving a 1.5 IoU improvement with 5.9x faster inference. 
- S2GO demonstrates state-of-the-art efficiency and performance in 3D occupancy prediction for driving scenes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations. However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient, query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g., GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing 5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate future research in this field.

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory. Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention. This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human cognition using neural network models.

<div> Implicit Neural Representations, Video Restoration, Super-resolution, Denoising, Hierarchical Encoding

Summary:
VR-INR is a novel video restoration method based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) designed for high-resolution video enhancement. Unlike existing methods limited to specific upscaling factors, VR-INR can generalize to any unseen super-resolution scales during testing. It also exhibits zero-shot denoising capabilities on noisy input despite lacking noisy data in training. The approach utilizes a hierarchical spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework along with multi-resolution implicit hash encoding to adaptively decode high-resolution and noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired magnification. Experimental results demonstrate VR-INR's superior performance in maintaining sharpness, preserving details, and effectively denoising compared to state-of-the-art techniques. <div>
arXiv:2506.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

Summary:
The article introduces MORSE-500, a video benchmark designed to assess multimodal reasoning abilities by incorporating temporal complexity and a broad spectrum of reasoning skills. The benchmark consists of 500 scripted video clips with questions across six reasoning categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using Python scripts and generative video models, allowing for precise control over difficulty levels. Unlike static benchmarks, MORSE-500 is built to evolve by enabling the creation of increasingly challenging instances. Initial experiments showed significant performance gaps in various reasoning categories, with abstract and planning tasks posing particular challenges for state-of-the-art systems. The dataset, generation scripts, and evaluation harness are released to support transparent and reproducible research in multimodal reasoning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve: its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems -- including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset, generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent, reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Summary:
Concept-based interpretable neural networks are popular for their intuitive explanations based on case-based reasoning. However, a limitation is concept inconsistency, where visual features are inappropriately mixed, leading to a lack of alignment between model reasoning and human understanding. The YoursProtoP strategy addresses this by allowing users to personalize prototypical parts according to their preferences. This interactive approach adapts and splits concepts to better match user understanding without compromising model accuracy. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that YoursProtoP achieves concept consistency, enhancing user comprehension of model explanations. <div>
arXiv:2506.05533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy of the model.

Summary:
FRAME is introduced as a self-supervised video frame encoder designed for dense video understanding. It addresses the challenge of generating temporally consistent, spatially dense features for every frame in video prediction tasks. By predicting current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, FRAME achieves spatial precision and temporal coherence in its representations. It surpasses existing image encoders and self-supervised video models on dense prediction tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. Additionally, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, enabling support for language-driven tasks like video classification. The evaluation of FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets demonstrates its superior performance and versatility, while maintaining a compact architecture suitable for various downstream applications. <div>

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent, spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge, FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

<div> Keywords: Computer vision, 3D techniques, egocentric videos, dynamic segmentation, motion fusion

Summary: 
In the study of computer vision, the focus has traditionally been on 2D techniques, with 3D vision limited to specific applications. Recent advancements in 3D models like neural radiance fields have shown promise in enhancing outputs derived from independent 2D views by integrating them into 3D and eliminating noise. However, challenges arise when applying 3D techniques to dynamic phenomena such as segmenting moving objects. To address this limitation, the proposed approach involves Layered Motion Fusion, where motion segmentation predictions from a 2D model are fused into layered radiance fields. Test-time refinement is utilized to simplify the data complexity in long dynamic videos, enabling the model to concentrate on specific frames. This combination of motion fusion and refinement results in significantly improved segmentation predictions by the 3D model compared to the 2D baseline, showcasing the potential of 3D techniques to enhance the analysis of dynamic phenomena in a realistic setting. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long, dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the (incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and realistic setting.

<div> Transformer layers, multimodal models, semantic hallucination, scene text, visual perception<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown significant progress in visual perception and reasoning but struggle with visually ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, resulting in semantic hallucinations. This work identifies that transformer layers in LLMs with stronger attention on text regions are less prone to semantic hallucination. A training-free framework is proposed, including ZoomText for text region identification and Grounded Layer Correction for adaptive decoding guidance. The TextHalu-Bench benchmark assesses model hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate effective mitigation of semantic hallucation and strong performance in scene text spotting and understanding tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work, we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for scene text spotting and understanding.

Summary: 
The paper introduces EX-4D, a novel framework for generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input, focusing on extreme viewpoints. The framework utilizes a Depth Watertight Mesh representation to address geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts, ensuring visual quality under extreme camera poses. A simulated masking strategy is proposed to generate training data from monocular videos, overcoming the lack of paired multi-view datasets. Additionally, a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is used to synthesize high-quality, physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms existing methods in terms of physical consistency and quality of extreme-view videos, making it a practical tool for 4D video generation. <div>

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries, leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality, physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video generation.

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless, pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete. SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes. To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives, storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint. We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

<div> Regularization Framework, Camera-based Occupancy Prediction, 3D Semantics, Scene Flow, VoxelSplat 

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper addresses the challenges in camera-based occupancy prediction, focusing on 3D semantics and scene flow. They introduce a regularization framework called VoxelSplat to enhance model performance. VoxelSplat improves semantics supervision by projecting 3D Gaussians onto the 2D camera view, providing additional supervision signals. It also learns scene flow by modeling the motion of Gaussians, enabling self-supervised learning of moving objects' scene flow using adjacent frame labels. The method can be seamlessly integrated into existing occupancy models without additional inference time. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that VoxelSplat improves the accuracy of semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation. The project page and codes are available for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

<div> Structured 3D generative model, PartCrafter, RGB image, multiple meshes, compositional generation architecture<br /><br />Summary: 
PartCrafter is a novel 3D generative model that can create multiple distinct 3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods, it doesn't require pre-segmented inputs and can denoise multiple 3D parts simultaneously to generate individual objects and complex scenes. The model is based on a pretrained 3D mesh diffusion transformer (DiT) and introduces a compositional latent space and hierarchical attention mechanism for structured generation. A new dataset with part-level annotations was curated to support part-level supervision. PartCrafter outperforms existing methods in generating decomposable 3D meshes, even those not directly visible in input images. This showcases the effectiveness of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding and synthesis. The code and training data will be made publicly available.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.05573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct 3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified, compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts, ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation. To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images, demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

<div> degradation, image restoration, UniRes, diffusion-based framework, complex degradations<br />
Summary:<br />
Real-world image restoration faces challenges due to diverse degradations from various sources. Existing methods struggle to generalize to in-the-wild data. This paper introduces UniRes, a diffusion-based framework that handles complex degradations by combining specialized models. UniRes transfers knowledge from isolated restoration tasks to address mixed degradations in an end-to-end manner. The framework is flexible, allowing for extensions and adjusting fidelity-quality trade-offs. Evaluation on complex-degradation and single-degradation datasets demonstrates improved performance, particularly for images with complex degradations. The proposed method offers a promising solution for real-world image restoration tasks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines. Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations, i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework, named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner. It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps, hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex degradations.

<title>Controlled Data Rebalancing in Multi-Task Learning for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing. Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent superiority across all degradation tasks.

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence (maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21 held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed. Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors for scalable open-world visual understanding.

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU, LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational complexity.

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone, subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI, with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR: 0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases, outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review (N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations. TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on 2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is vital for robust progress in the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

arXiv:2506.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper, we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference acceleration.

<title>You Only Estimate Once: Unified, One-stage, Real-Time Category-level Articulated Object 6D Pose Estimation for Robotic Grasping</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method.

<title>Investigating the Relationship between Weighted Figure of Merit and Rosin's Measure</title>

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures - weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis, experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit instead of Rosin's measure.

Abstract: We present a method for 3D ball trajectory estimation from a 2D tracking sequence. To overcome the ambiguity in 3D from 2D estimation, we design an LSTM-based pipeline that utilizes a novel canonical 3D representation that is independent of the camera's location to handle arbitrary views and a series of intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices. Despite training solely on simulated data, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and can generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple trajectories, opening up a range of applications in sport analysis and virtual replay.

<title>Do Large Vision-Language Models Distinguish between the Actual and Apparent Features of Illusions?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05765</link>

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions. However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types, they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available at https://github.com/ynklab/FILM

<title>Robust sensor fusion against on-vehicle sensor staleness</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05780</link>

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale conditions.

Abstract: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ) Challenge at CVPR 2025. Egocentric video captures the scene from the wearer's perspective, where gaze serves as a key non-verbal communication cue that reflects visual attention and offer insights into human intention and cognition. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, GazeNLQ, which leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/stevenlin510/GazeNLQ.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges. Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions, which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking, listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX 4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45 FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140 ms and 215 ms, respectively.

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity, noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in https://github.com/barry664/DeformCL

arXiv:2506.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance. The code is available at https://github.com/nayutayuki/FuseUNet.

<title>High Throughput Event Filtering: The Interpolation-based DIF Algorithm Hardware Architecture</title>

arXiv:2506.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor. We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community. Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second (MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise levels.

<title>FontAdapter: Instant Font Adaptation in Visual Text Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively. Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending, and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile framework for font customization tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view), the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective (e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives, thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at https://github.com/lovelyqian/ObjectRelator.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field, existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics. Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments, and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT) device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32 images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional, uniform light.

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

<title>Domain-RAG: Retrieval-Guided Compositional Image Generation for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection</title>

arXiv:2506.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck" without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2) multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and (3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025 Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public baseline by 2.77%.

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However, most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders, i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder (SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at https://github.com/liyih/CSCL.

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%, which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper, we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is available at link https://github.com/earis/Offsetadjustment\_Background-location\_Decoder\_Mask2former.

<title>Rethinking Semi-supervised Segmentation Beyond Accuracy: Reliability and Robustness</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05917</link>

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models. Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world deployment needs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts. However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role. Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless, jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and (2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance, streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static 3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry. Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection. However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research. This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA methods in agricultural image analysis.

<title>MCA-Bench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating CAPTCHA Robustness Against VLM-based Attacks</title>

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

<title>Bootstrapping World Models from Dynamics Models in Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06006</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly, the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

<title>Sample-Specific Noise Injection For Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06027</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI). Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then, based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/SSNI.

<title>HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1) The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior, capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing models.

arXiv:2506.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums). The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of 97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing and modelling codes are publicly available at https://github.com/diehlj/fast-iterated-sums.

<title>SDS-Net: Shallow-Deep Synergism-detection Network for infrared small target detection</title>

arXiv:2506.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed. Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at https://github.com/PhysiLearn/SDS-Net.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP, and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

<title>WisWheat: A Three-Tiered Vision-Language Dataset for Wheat Management</title>

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield. Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology; (2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements. Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need. Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

<title>VideoChat-A1: Thinking with Long Videos by Chain-of-Shot Reasoning</title>

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos, while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human. Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm. Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema, outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with 7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE). Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information, and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion, spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.

<title>CLaMR: Contextualized Late-Interaction for Multimodal Content Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06144</link>

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision, speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text, and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4 over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50% boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on LongVideoBench.

<title>A Novel Large-scale Crop Dataset and Dual-stream Transformer Method for Fine-grained Hierarchical Crop Classification from Integrated Hyperspectral EnMAP Data and Multispectral Sentinel-2 Time Series</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06155</link>

arXiv:2506.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios. Codes and dataset will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/H2Crop and www.glass.hku.hk

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors (e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large language model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback. Experiments on the HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and physical understanding.

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

<title>GenIR: Generative Visual Feedback for Mental Image Retrieval</title>

arXiv:2506.06220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind, that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation for future research in this direction.

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization versus 0-30% with standard configurations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists, `conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems' capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g., Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form. Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at: \href{https://vga.csail.mit.edu/}{vga.csail.mit.edu}

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric (third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years, allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications. Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis, and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally, we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives, evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions. By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner.

Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable, high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a significant margin.

<title>Movie Facts and Fibs (MF$^2$): A Benchmark for Long Movie Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06275</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge, partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral, ``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length, open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs -- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs. These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

arXiv:2506.06276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation, we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity, complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization. STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and resolution.

Abstract: We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains 3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only 44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human specialists/experts. We believe that ExAct will be beneficial for developing and evaluating VLMs capable of precise understanding of human skills in various physical and procedural domains.

arXiv:2506.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations, we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering, demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM architectures.

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/TerraFM .

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels (referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover, we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more realistic reconstructed images.

<title>Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs</title>

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2) Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in training cost of less than 15%.

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31% accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01) under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively, compared to a baseline U-Net model.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality 3D environments is crucial for industries such as gaming, virtual reality, and cinema, yet remains resource-intensive due to the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their characteristics, strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. By examining state-of-the-art approaches, it presents key challenges such as scene authenticity and the influence of textual inputs. Special attention is given to how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current models. In addition, this review surveys existing evaluation metrics for assessing realism and explores how industry professionals incorporate AI into their workflows. The findings of this study aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape and serve as a foundation for future research on AI-driven 3D content generation. Key findings include that advanced generative architectures enable high-quality 3D content creation at a high computational cost, effective multi-modal integration techniques like cross-attention and latent space alignment facilitate text-to-3D tasks, and the quality and diversity of training data combined with comprehensive evaluation metrics are critical to achieving scalable, robust 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL, a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of complex 3D scenes.

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at the resolution of individual neurons.

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode different types of information and may thus draw information differently from the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data. This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model, capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how outputs borrow from training data.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks, is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced "Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality, structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately 10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets. Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog, the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our evaluation publicly available.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs, achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6% and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by 6.3${\times}$.

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data, which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances. The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or computational complexity.

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search (NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS, the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS. Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of 28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have been substantial, but developing real-time systems for perceptual task guidance remains challenging. These systems must provide interactive, proactive assistance based on streaming visual inputs, yet their development is constrained by the costly and labor-intensive process of data collection and system evaluation. To address these limitations, we present a comprehensive framework with three key contributions. First, we introduce a novel data curation pipeline that synthesizes dialogues from annotated egocentric videos, resulting in \dataset, a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This work lays the foundation for developing real-time, proactive AI assistants capable of guiding users through diverse tasks. Project page: https://pro-assist.github.io/

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate, therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic representation of eye images that contains the information required for verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning, human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints, we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity, facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More information and results can be found on the page https://surgsplat.github.io/.

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates. This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation. However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task, and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges. Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales, thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively, and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of FPDANet.

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours. A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration. A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour; these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63 longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields the best results on both test datasets.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet), transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in real-world settings.

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations, presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations, elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital health tools across clinical domains.

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery (SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the optimisation of the learning process.

<title>3DFlowAction: Learning Cross-Embodiment Manipulation from 3D Flow World Model</title>

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability. Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without hardware-specific training.

<title>PuzzleWorld: A Benchmark for Multimodal, Open-Ended Reasoning in Puzzlehunts</title>

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery, exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy, with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from 4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning, are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature, comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.

Abstract: We propose a combined generative and contrastive neural architecture for learning latent representations of 3D volumetric shapes. The architecture uses two encoder branches for voxel grids and multi-view images from the same underlying shape. The main idea is to combine a contrastive loss between the resulting latent representations with an additional reconstruction loss. That helps to avoid collapsing the latent representations as a trivial solution for minimizing the contrastive loss. A novel dynamic switching approach is used to cross-train two encoders with a shared decoder. The switching approach also enables the stop gradient operation on a random branch. Further classification experiments show that the latent representations learned with our self-supervised method integrate more useful information from the additional input data implicitly, thus leading to better reconstruction and classification performance.

<title>Pseudo-labelling meets Label Smoothing for Noisy Partial Label Learning</title>

Abstract: We motivate weakly supervised learning as an effective learning paradigm for problems where curating perfectly annotated datasets is expensive and may require domain expertise such as fine-grained classification. We focus on Partial Label Learning (PLL), a weakly-supervised learning paradigm where each training instance is paired with a set of candidate labels (partial label), one of which is the true label. Noisy PLL (NPLL) relaxes this constraint by allowing some partial labels to not contain the true label, enhancing the practicality of the problem. Our work centres on NPLL and presents a framework that initially assigns pseudo-labels to images by exploiting the noisy partial labels through a weighted nearest neighbour algorithm. These pseudo-label and image pairs are then used to train a deep neural network classifier with label smoothing. The classifier's features and predictions are subsequently employed to refine and enhance the accuracy of pseudo-labels. We perform thorough experiments on seven datasets and compare against nine NPLL and PLL methods. We achieve state-of-the-art results in all studied settings from the prior literature, obtaining substantial gains in the simulated fine-grained benchmarks. Further, we show the promising generalisation capability of our framework in realistic, fine-grained, crowd-sourced datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces LlavaGuard, a suite of VLM-based vision safeguards that address the critical need for reliable guardrails in the era of large-scale data and models. To this end, we establish a novel open framework, describing a customizable safety taxonomy, data preprocessing, augmentation, and training setup. For teaching a VLM safeguard on safety, we further create a multimodal safety dataset with high-quality human expert annotations, where each image is labeled with a safety rating, category, and rationale. We also employ advanced augmentations to support context-specific assessments. The resulting LlavaGuard models, ranging from 0.5B to 7B, serve as a versatile tool for evaluating the safety compliance of visual content against flexible policies. In comprehensive experiments, LlavaGuard outperforms both state-of-the-art safeguards and VLMs in accuracy and in flexibly handling different policies. Additionally, we demonstrate LlavaGuard's performance in two real-world applications: large-scale dataset annotation and moderation of text-to-image models. We make our entire framework, including the dataset, model weights, and training code.

Abstract: Regular screening and early discovery of uterine fibroid are crucial for preventing potential malignant transformations and ensuring timely, life-saving interventions. To this end, we collect and annotate the first ultrasound video dataset with 100 videos for uterine fibroid segmentation (UFUV). We also present Local-Global Reciprocal Network (LGRNet) to efficiently and effectively propagate the long-term temporal context which is crucial to help distinguish between uninformative noisy surrounding tissues and target lesion regions. Specifically, the Cyclic Neighborhood Propagation (CNP) is introduced to propagate the inter-frame local temporal context in a cyclic manner. Moreover, to aggregate global temporal context, we first condense each frame into a set of frame bottleneck queries and devise Hilbert Selective Scan (HilbertSS) to both efficiently path connect each frame and preserve the locality bias. A distribute layer is then utilized to disseminate back the global context for reciprocal refinement. Extensive experiments on UFUV and three public Video Polyp Segmentation (VPS) datasets demonstrate consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods, indicating the effectiveness and versatility of LGRNet. Code, checkpoints, and dataset are available at https://github.com/bio-mlhui/LGRNet

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds is a global challenge that can be alleviated by the adoption of automatic systems for clinical wound assessment from consumer-grade videos. While 2D image analysis approaches are insufficient for handling the 3D features of wounds, existing approaches utilizing 3D reconstruction methods have not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study on 3D wound reconstruction from consumer-grade videos. Specifically, we introduce the SALVE dataset, comprising video recordings of realistic wound phantoms captured with different cameras. Using this dataset, we assess the accuracy and precision of state-of-the-art methods for 3D reconstruction, ranging from traditional photogrammetry pipelines to advanced neural rendering approaches. In our experiments, we observe that photogrammetry approaches do not provide smooth surfaces suitable for precise clinical measurements of wounds. Neural rendering approaches show promise in addressing this issue, advancing the use of this technology in wound care practices.

Abstract: Understanding the inner representation of a neural network helps users improve models. Concept-based methods have become a popular choice for explaining deep neural networks post-hoc because, unlike most other explainable AI techniques, they can be used to test high-level visual "concepts" that are not directly related to feature attributes. For instance, the concept of "stripes" is important to classify an image as a zebra. Concept-based explanation methods, however, require practitioners to guess and manually collect multiple candidate concept image sets, making the process labor-intensive and prone to overlooking important concepts. Addressing this limitation, in this paper, we frame concept image set creation as an image generation problem. However, since naively using a standard generative model does not result in meaningful concepts, we devise a reinforcement learning-based preference optimization (RLPO) algorithm that fine-tunes a vision-language generative model from approximate textual descriptions of concepts. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate our method's ability to efficiently and reliably articulate diverse concepts that are otherwise challenging to craft manually.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve better zero-shot forecast performance than existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting that visual models may offer a "free lunch" for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research.

Abstract: Diffusion models are cutting-edge generative models adept at producing diverse, high-quality images. Despite their effectiveness, these models often require significant computational resources owing to their numerous sequential denoising steps and the significant inference cost of each step. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques have been employed to automatically search for faster generation processes. However, NAS for diffusion is inherently time-consuming as it requires estimating thousands of diffusion models to search for the optimal one. In this paper, we introduce Flexiffusion, a novel training-free NAS paradigm designed to accelerate diffusion models by concurrently optimizing generation steps and network structures. Specifically, we partition the generation process into isometric step segments, each sequentially composed of a full step, multiple partial steps, and several null steps. The full step computes all network blocks, while the partial step involves part of the blocks, and the null step entails no computation. Flexiffusion autonomously explores flexible step combinations for each segment, substantially reducing search costs and enabling greater acceleration compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for diffusion models. Our searched models reported speedup factors of $2.6\times$ and $1.5\times$ for the original LDM-4-G and the SOTA, respectively. The factors for Stable Diffusion V1.5 and the SOTA are $5.1\times$ and $2.0\times$. We also verified the performance of Flexiffusion on multiple datasets, and positive experiment results indicate that Flexiffusion can effectively reduce redundancy in diffusion models.

Abstract: Text-rich images, where text serves as the central visual element guiding the overall understanding, are prevalent in real-world applications, such as presentation slides, scanned documents, and webpage snapshots. Tasks involving multiple text-rich images are especially challenging, as they require not only understanding the content of individual images but reasoning about inter-relationships and logical flows across multiple visual inputs. Despite the importance of these scenarios, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to handle such tasks due to two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning datasets for text-rich multi-image scenarios, and (2) the difficulty in balancing image resolution with visual feature sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose Leopard, an MLLM tailored for handling vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images. First, we curated about one million high-quality multimodal instruction-tuning data, tailored to text-rich, multi-image scenarios. Second, we proposed an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module to dynamically optimize the allocation of visual sequence length based on the original aspect ratios and resolutions of images. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks reveal that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, such as Llama-3.2 and Qwen2-VL, in challenging text-rich, multi-image evaluations. Remarkably, our approach achieves outstanding performance using only 1.2M training instances, all of which are fully open-sourced, demonstrating both high efficiency and effectiveness compared to models trained on large-scale in-house data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tencent-ailab/Leopard.

Abstract: Out-of-Domain (OOD) generalization is the ability of a model trained on one or more domains to generalize to unseen domains. In the ImageNet era of computer vision, evaluation sets for measuring a model's OOD performance were designed to be strictly OOD with respect to style. However, the emergence of foundation models and expansive web-scale datasets has obfuscated this evaluation process, as datasets cover a broad range of domains and risk test domain contamination. In search of the forgotten domain generalization, we create large-scale datasets subsampled from LAION -- LAION-Natural and LAION-Rendition -- that are strictly OOD to corresponding ImageNet and DomainNet test sets in terms of style. Training CLIP models on these datasets reveals that a significant portion of their performance is explained by in-domain examples. This indicates that the OOD generalization challenges from the ImageNet era still prevail and that training on web-scale data merely creates the illusion of OOD generalization. Furthermore, through a systematic exploration of combining natural and rendition datasets in varying proportions, we identify optimal mixing ratios for model generalization across these domains. Our datasets and results re-enable meaningful assessment of OOD robustness at scale -- a crucial prerequisite for improving model robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, separate training of visual and textual encoders often results in a misalignment of the modality. Such misalignment may lead models to generate content that is absent from the input image, a phenomenon referred to as hallucination. These inaccuracies severely undermine the trustworthiness of MLLMs in real-world applications. Despite attempts to optimize text preferences to mitigate this issue, our initial investigation indicates that the trustworthiness of MLLMs remains inadequate. Specifically, these models tend to provide preferred answers even when the input image is heavily distorted. Analysis of visual token attention also indicates that the model focuses primarily on the surrounding context rather than the key object referenced in the question. These findings highlight a misalignment between the modalities, where answers inadequately leverage input images. Motivated by our findings, we propose Modality-Fair Preference Optimization (MFPO), which comprises three components: the construction of a multimodal preference dataset in which dispreferred images differ from originals solely in key regions; an image reward loss function encouraging the model to generate answers better aligned with the input images; and an easy-to-hard iterative alignment strategy to stabilize joint modality training. Extensive experiments on three trustworthiness benchmarks demonstrate that MFPO significantly enhances the trustworthiness of MLLMs. In particular, it enables the 7B models to attain trustworthiness levels on par with, or even surpass, those of the 13B, 34B, and larger models.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, the scarcity of labeled training data poses a significant challenge when training deep neural networks. When using U-Net-style architectures, it is common practice to address this problem by pretraining the encoder part on a large general-purpose dataset like ImageNet. However, these methods are resource-intensive and do not guarantee improved performance on the downstream task. In this paper we investigate a variety of training setups on medical image segmentation datasets, using ImageNet-pretrained models. By examining over 300 combinations of models, datasets, and training methods, we find that shorter pretraining often leads to better results on the downstream task, providing additional proof to the well-known fact that the accuracy of the model on ImageNet is a poor indicator for downstream performance. As our main contribution, we introduce a novel transferability metric, based on contrastive learning, that measures how robustly a pretrained model is able to represent the target data. In contrast to other transferability scores, our method is applicable to the case of transferring from ImageNet classification to medical image segmentation. We apply our robustness score by measuring it throughout the pretraining phase to indicate when the model weights are optimal for downstream transfer. This reduces pretraining time and improves results on the target task.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) has gained significant attention as a means to remove specific data from trained models without requiring a full retraining process. While progress has been made in unimodal domains like text and image classification, unlearning in multimodal models remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in CLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual representations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and selectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that unlearning does not compromise model performance. CLIPErase consists of three key modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget set, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a Consistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Flickr30K datasets across four CLIP downstream tasks demonstrate that CLIPErase effectively forgets designated associations in zero-shot tasks for multimodal samples, while preserving the model's performance on the retain set after unlearning.

Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning paradigm for visual representation learning, enabling models to acquire rich visual representations by predicting masked portions of images from their visible regions. While this approach has shown promising results, we hypothesize that its effectiveness may be limited by optimization challenges during early training stages, where models are expected to learn complex image distributions from partial observations before developing basic visual processing capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a prototype-driven curriculum leagrning framework that structures the learning process to progress from prototypical examples to more complex variations in the dataset. Our approach introduces a temperature-based annealing scheme that gradually expands the training distribution, enabling more stable and efficient learning trajectories. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, we demonstrate that our curriculum learning strategy significantly improves both training efficiency and representation quality while requiring substantially fewer training epochs compared to standard Masked Auto-Encoding. Our findings suggest that carefully controlling the order of training examples plays a crucial role in self-supervised visual learning, providing a practical solution to the early-stage optimization challenges in MIM.

Abstract: Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different distributions or domains is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning; for example, to evaluate the output quality of image generative models. Currently, metrics used for this task either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task, such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Distance/FID) from natural imaging, which we show insufficiently capture anatomical features. To this end, we introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images, FRD (Fr\'echet Radiomic Distance), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful, and interpretable image features. We show that FRD is superior to other image distribution metrics for a range of medical imaging applications, including out-of-domain (OOD) detection, the evaluation of image-to-image translation (by correlating more with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism), and the evaluation of unconditional image generation. Moreover, FRD offers additional benefits such as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes, sensitivity to image corruptions and adversarial attacks, feature interpretability, and correlation with radiologist-perceived image quality. Additionally, we address key gaps in the literature by presenting an extensive framework for the multifaceted evaluation of image similarity metrics in medical imaging -- including the first large-scale comparative study of generative models for medical image translation -- and release an accessible codebase to facilitate future research. Our results are supported by thorough experiments spanning a variety of datasets, modalities, and downstream tasks, highlighting the broad potential of FRD for medical image analysis.

Abstract: We study the problem of generating temporal object intrinsics -- temporally evolving sequences of object geometry, reflectance, and texture, such as a blooming rose -- from pre-trained 2D foundation models. Unlike conventional 3D modeling and animation techniques that require extensive manual effort and expertise, we introduce a method that generates such assets with signals distilled from pre-trained 2D diffusion models. To ensure the temporal consistency of object intrinsics, we propose Neural Templates for temporal-state-guided distillation, derived automatically from image features from self-supervised learning. Our method can generate high-quality temporal object intrinsics for several natural phenomena and enable the sampling and controllable rendering of these dynamic objects from any viewpoint, under any environmental lighting conditions, at any time of their lifespan.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are likelihood-based models for continuous inputs. They have demonstrated promising results on both density estimation and generative modeling tasks, but have received relatively little attention in recent years. In this work, we demonstrate that NFs are more powerful than previously believed. We present TarFlow: a simple and scalable architecture that enables highly performant NF models. TarFlow can be thought of as a Transformer-based variant of Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAFs): it consists of a stack of autoregressive Transformer blocks on image patches, alternating the autoregression direction between layers. TarFlow is straightforward to train end-to-end, and capable of directly modeling and generating pixels. We also propose three key techniques to improve sample quality: Gaussian noise augmentation during training, a post training denoising procedure, and an effective guidance method for both class-conditional and unconditional settings. Putting these together, TarFlow sets new state-of-the-art results on likelihood estimation for images, beating the previous best methods by a large margin, and generates samples with quality and diversity comparable to diffusion models, for the first time with a stand-alone NF model. We make our code available at https://github.com/apple/ml-tarflow.

Abstract: Automatically generating multiview illusions is a compelling challenge, where a single piece of visual content offers distinct interpretations from different viewing perspectives. Traditional methods, such as shadow art and wire art, create interesting 3D illusions but are limited to simple visual outputs (i.e., figure-ground or line drawing), restricting their artistic expressiveness and practical versatility. Recent diffusion-based illusion generation methods can generate more intricate designs but are confined to 2D images. In this work, we present a simple yet effective approach for creating 3D multiview illusions based on user-provided text prompts or images. Our method leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to optimize the textures and geometry of neural 3D representations through differentiable rendering. When viewed from multiple angles, this produces different interpretations. We develop several techniques to improve the quality of the generated 3D multiview illusions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and showcase illusion generation with diverse 3D forms.

Abstract: Recently released open-source pre-trained foundational image segmentation and object detection models (SAM2+GroundingDINO) allow for geometrically consistent segmentation of objects of interest in multi-view 2D images. Users can use text-based or click-based prompts to segment objects of interest without requiring labeled training datasets. Gaussian Splatting allows for the learning of the 3D representation of a scene's geometry and radiance based on 2D images. Combining Google Earth Studio, SAM2+GroundingDINO, 2D Gaussian Splatting, and our improvements in mask refinement based on morphological operations and contour simplification, we created a pipeline to extract the 3D mesh of any building based on its name, address, or geographic coordinates.

Abstract: Backpropagation provides a generalized configuration for overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Optimizers such as SGD and Adam are commonly used for weight updates in continual learning and continual pre-training. However, access to gradient information is not always feasible in practice due to black-box APIs, hardware constraints, or non-differentiable systems, a challenge we refer to as the gradient bans. To bridge this gap, we introduce ZeroFlow, the first benchmark designed to evaluate gradient-free optimization algorithms for overcoming forgetting. ZeroFlow examines a suite of forward pass-based methods across various algorithms, forgetting scenarios, and datasets. Our results show that forward passes alone can be sufficient to mitigate forgetting. We uncover novel optimization principles that highlight the potential of forward pass-based methods in mitigating forgetting, managing task conflicts, and reducing memory demands. Additionally, we propose new enhancements that further improve forgetting resistance using only forward passes. This work provides essential tools and insights to advance the development of forward-pass-based methods for continual learning.

Abstract: We present a cost-effective new approach for generating denser depth maps for Autonomous Driving (AD) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by integrating the images obtained from deep neural network (DNN) 4D radar detectors with conventional camera RGB images. Our approach introduces a novel pixel positional encoding algorithm inspired by Bartlett's spatial spectrum estimation technique. This algorithm transforms both radar depth maps and RGB images into a unified pixel image subspace called the Spatial Spectrum, facilitating effective learning based on their similarities and differences. Our method effectively leverages high-resolution camera images to train radar depth map generative models, addressing the limitations of conventional radar detectors in complex vehicular environments, thus sharpening the radar output. We develop spectrum estimation algorithms tailored for radar depth maps and RGB images, a comprehensive training framework for data-driven generative models, and a camera-radar deployment scheme for AV operation. Our results demonstrate that our approach also outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 27.95% in terms of Unidirectional Chamfer Distance (UCD).

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/UniDB-SOC/UniDB/.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating high-quality, diverse visual content from natural language prompts. However, their ability to reproduce copyrighted styles, sensitive imagery, and harmful content raises significant ethical and legal concerns. Concept erasure offers a proactive alternative to external filtering by modifying T2I models to prevent the generation of undesired content. In this survey, we provide a structured overview of concept erasure, categorizing existing methods based on their optimization strategies and the architectural components they modify. We categorize concept erasure methods into fine-tuning for parameter updates, closed-form solutions for efficient edits, and inference-time interventions for content restriction without weight modification. Additionally, we explore adversarial attacks that bypass erasure techniques and discuss emerging defenses. To support further research, we consolidate key datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks for assessing erasure effectiveness and model robustness. This survey serves as a comprehensive resource, offering insights into the evolving landscape of concept erasure, its challenges, and future directions.

Abstract: Visual captioning benchmarks have become outdated with the emergence of modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as the brief ground-truth sentences and traditional metrics fail to assess detailed captions effectively. While recent benchmarks attempt to address this by focusing on keyword extraction or object-centric evaluation, they remain limited to vague-view or object-view analyses and incomplete visual element coverage. In this paper, we introduce CAPability, a comprehensive multi-view benchmark for evaluating visual captioning across 12 dimensions spanning six critical views. We curate nearly 11K human-annotated images and videos with visual element annotations to evaluate the generated captions. CAPability stably assesses both the correctness and thoroughness of captions with \textit{precision} and \textit{hit} metrics. By converting annotations to QA pairs, we further introduce a heuristic metric, \textit{know but cannot tell} ($K\bar{T}$), indicating a significant performance gap between QA and caption capabilities. Our work provides a holistic analysis of MLLMs' captioning abilities, as we identify their strengths and weaknesses across various dimensions, guiding future research to enhance specific aspects of their capabilities.

Abstract: Knowing where a particular species can or cannot be found on Earth is crucial for ecological research and conservation efforts. By mapping the spatial ranges of all species, we would obtain deeper insights into how global biodiversity is affected by climate change and habitat loss. However, accurate range estimates are only available for a relatively small proportion of all known species. For the majority of the remaining species, we typically only have a small number of records denoting the spatial locations where they have previously been observed. We outline a new approach for few-shot species range estimation to address the challenge of accurately estimating the range of a species from limited data. During inference, our model takes a set of spatial locations as input, along with optional metadata such as text or an image, and outputs a species encoding that can be used to predict the range of a previously unseen species in a feedforward manner. We evaluate our approach on two challenging benchmarks, where we obtain state-of-the-art range estimation performance, in a fraction of the compute time, compared to recent alternative approaches.

Abstract: Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&amp;E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&amp;E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.

<title>A novel non-convex minimax $p$-th order concave penalty function approach to low-rank tensor completion</title>

Abstract: The low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) problem aims to reconstruct a tensor from partial sample information, which has attracted significant interest in a wide range of practical applications such as image processing and computer vision. Among the various techniques employed for the LRTC problem, non-convex relaxation methods have been widely studied for their effectiveness in handling tensor singular values, which are crucial for accurate tensor recovery. While the minimax concave penalty (MCP) non-convex relaxation method has achieved promising results in tackling the LRTC problem and gained widely adopted, it exhibits a notable limitation: insufficient penalty on small singular values during the singular value handling process, resulting in inefficient tensor recovery. To address this issue and enhance recovery performance, a novel minimax $p$-th order concave penalty (MPCP) function is proposed. Based on this novel function, a tensor $p$-th order $\tau$ norm is proposed as a non-convex relaxation for tensor rank approximation, thereby establishing an MPCP-based LRTC model. Furthermore, theoretical convergence guarantees are rigorously established for the proposed method. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation have recently received much attention in the area of vision and language. Existing UniMs are designed to simultaneously learn both multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, demanding substantial computational resources, and often struggle to generate interleaved text-image. We present ARMOR, a resource-efficient and pure autoregressive framework that achieves both understanding and generation by fine-tuning existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, ARMOR extends existing MLLMs from three perspectives: (1) For model architecture, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with a forward-switching mechanism is introduced to unify embedding space integrating textual and visual modalities for enabling natural text-image interleaved generation with minimal computational overhead. (2) For training data, a meticulously curated, high-quality interleaved dataset is collected for fine-tuning MLLMs. (3) For the training algorithm, we propose a ``what or how to generate'' algorithm to empower existing MLLMs with multimodal generation capabilities while preserving their multimodal understanding capabilities, through three progressive training stages based on the collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ARMOR upgrades existing MLLMs to UniMs with promising image generation capabilities, using limited training resources. Our code will be released soon at https://github.com/finyorko/armor.

Abstract: Understanding plant growth dynamics is essential for applications in agriculture and plant phenotyping. We present the Growth Modelling (GroMo) challenge, which is designed for two primary tasks: (1) plant age prediction and (2) leaf count estimation, both essential for crop monitoring and precision agriculture. For this challenge, we introduce GroMo25, a dataset with images of four crops: radish, okra, wheat, and mustard. Each crop consists of multiple plants (p1, p2, ..., pn) captured over different days (d1, d2, ..., dm) and categorized into five levels (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5). Each plant is captured from 24 different angles with a 15-degree gap between images. Participants are required to perform both tasks for all four crops with these multiview images. We proposed a Multiview Vision Transformer (MVVT) model for the GroMo challenge and evaluated the crop-wise performance on GroMo25. MVVT reports an average MAE of 7.74 for age prediction and an MAE of 5.52 for leaf count. The GroMo Challenge aims to advance plant phenotyping research by encouraging innovative solutions for tracking and predicting plant growth.

Abstract: Self-supervised 3D occupancy prediction offers a promising solution for understanding complex driving scenes without requiring costly 3D annotations. However, training dense occupancy decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and once trained, such models struggle to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or novel object categories without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-Occ. Our method incrementally constructs, optimizes and voxelizes time-aware 3D Gaussians from raw sensor streams by integrating vision foundation models (VLMs) at runtime. The flexible nature of 3D Gaussians allows voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolutions, while the generalization ability of VLMs enables accurate perception and open-vocabulary recognition, without any network training or fine-tuning. Specifically, TT-Occ operates in a lift-track-voxelize symphony: We first lift the geometry and semantics of surrounding-view extracted from VLMs to instantiate Gaussians at 3D space; Next, we track dynamic Gaussians while accumulating static ones to complete the scene and enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we voxelize the optimized Gaussians to generate occupancy prediction. Optionally, inherent noise in VLM predictions and tracking is mitigated by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our framework, we offer two variants: one LiDAR-based and one vision-centric, and conduct extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft benchmarks with varying voxel resolutions. Code will be available at https://github.com/Xian-Bei/TT-Occ.

Abstract: We address key limitations in existing datasets and models for task-oriented hand-object interaction video generation, a critical approach of generating video demonstrations for robotic imitation learning. Current datasets, such as Ego4D, often suffer from inconsistent view perspectives and misaligned interactions, leading to reduced video quality and limiting their applicability for precise imitation learning tasks. Towards this end, we introduce TASTE-Rob -- a pioneering large-scale dataset of 100,856 ego-centric hand-object interaction videos. Each video is meticulously aligned with language instructions and recorded from a consistent camera viewpoint to ensure interaction clarity. By fine-tuning a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) on TASTE-Rob, we achieve realistic object interactions, though we observed occasional inconsistencies in hand grasping postures. To enhance realism, we introduce a three-stage pose-refinement pipeline that improves hand posture accuracy in generated videos. Our curated dataset, coupled with the specialized pose-refinement framework, provides notable performance gains in generating high-quality, task-oriented hand-object interaction videos, resulting in achieving superior generalizable robotic manipulation. The TASTE-Rob dataset is publicly available to foster further advancements in the field, TASTE-Rob dataset and source code will be made publicly available on our website https://taste-rob.github.io.

Abstract: The rapid increase in the number of Computed Tomography (CT) scan examinations has created an urgent need for automated tools, such as organ segmentation, anomaly classification, and report generation, to assist radiologists with their growing workload. Multi-label classification of Three-Dimensional (3D) CT scans is a challenging task due to the volumetric nature of the data and the variety of anomalies to be detected. Existing deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, while Vision Transformers require extensive pre-training, posing challenges for practical use. Additionally, these existing methods do not explicitly model the radiologist's navigational behavior while scrolling through CT scan slices, which requires both global context understanding and local detail awareness. In this study, we present CT-Scroll, a novel global-local attention model specifically designed to emulate the scrolling behavior of radiologists during the analysis of 3D CT scans. Our approach is evaluated on two public datasets, demonstrating its efficacy through comprehensive experiments and an ablation study that highlights the contribution of each model component.

Abstract: Given that interpretability and steerability are crucial to AI safety, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a tool to enhance them in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we extend the application of SAEs to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, and introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating monosemanticity at the neuron-level in vision representations. To ensure that our evaluation aligns with human perception, we propose a benchmark derived from a large-scale user study. Our experimental results reveal that SAEs trained on VLMs significantly enhance the monosemanticity of individual neurons, with sparsity and wide latents being the most influential factors. Notably, we demonstrate that applying SAE interventions on CLIP's vision encoder directly steers multimodal LLM outputs (e.g., LLaVA), without any modifications to the underlying model. These findings emphasize the practicality and efficacy of SAEs as an unsupervised tool for enhancing both interpretability and control of VLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/sae-for-vlm.

Abstract: Cephalopods exhibit unique colour discrimination capabilities despite having one type of photoreceptor, relying instead on chromatic aberration induced by their ocular optics and pupil shapes to perceive spectral information. We took inspiration from this biological mechanism to design a spectral imaging system that combines a ball lens with an event-based camera. Our approach relies on a motorised system that shifts the focal position, mirroring the adaptive lens motion in cephalopods. This approach has enabled us to achieve wavelength-dependent focusing across the visible light and near-infrared spectrum, making the event a spectral sensor. We characterise chromatic aberration effects, using both event-based and conventional frame-based sensors, validating the effectiveness of bio-inspired spectral discrimination both in simulation and in a real setup as well as assessing the spectral discrimination performance. Our proposed approach provides a robust spectral sensing capability without conventional colour filters or computational demosaicing. This approach opens new pathways toward new spectral sensing systems inspired by nature's evolutionary solutions.

Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, crop classification and health detection based on deep learning have gradually become a research hotspot. However, the existing target detection methods show poor performance when dealing with small targets in remote sensing images, especially in the case of complex background and image mixing, which is difficult to meet the practical application requirementsite. To address this problem, a novel target detection model YOLO-RS is proposed in this paper. The model is based on the latest Yolov11 which significantly enhances the detection of small targets by introducing the Context Anchor Attention (CAA) mechanism and an efficient multi-field multi-scale feature fusion network. YOLO-RS adopts a bidirectional feature fusion strategy in the feature fusion process, which effectively enhances the model's performance in the detection of small targets. Small target detection. Meanwhile, the ACmix module at the end of the model backbone network solves the category imbalance problem by adaptively adjusting the contrast and sample mixing, thus enhancing the detection accuracy in complex scenes. In the experiments on the PDT remote sensing crop health detection dataset and the CWC crop classification dataset, YOLO-RS improves both the recall and the mean average precision (mAP) by about 2-3\% or so compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while the F1-score is also significantly improved. Moreover, the computational complexity of the model only increases by about 5.2 GFLOPs, indicating its significant advantages in both performance and efficiency. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and application potential of YOLO-RS in the task of detecting small targets in remote sensing images.

Abstract: This technical report introduces a targeted improvement to the StreamPETR framework, specifically aimed at enhancing velocity estimation, a critical factor influencing the overall NuScenes Detection Score. While StreamPETR exhibits strong 3D bounding box detection performance as reflected by its high mean Average Precision our analysis identified velocity estimation as a substantial bottleneck when evaluated on the NuScenes dataset. To overcome this limitation, we propose a customized positional embedding strategy tailored to enhance temporal modeling capabilities. Experimental evaluations conducted on the NuScenes test set demonstrate that our improved approach achieves a state-of-the-art NDS of 70.86% using the ViT-L backbone, setting a new benchmark for camera-only 3D object detection.

Abstract: Visual text is a crucial component in both document and scene images, conveying rich semantic information and attracting significant attention in the computer vision community. Beyond traditional tasks such as text detection and recognition, visual text processing has witnessed rapid advancements driven by the emergence of foundation models, including text image reconstruction and text image manipulation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain due to the unique properties that differentiate text from general objects. Effectively capturing and leveraging these distinct textual characteristics is essential for developing robust visual text processing models. In this survey, we present a comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis of recent advancements in visual text processing, focusing on two key questions: (1) What textual features are most suitable for different visual text processing tasks? (2) How can these distinctive text features be effectively incorporated into processing frameworks? Furthermore, we introduce VTPBench, a new benchmark that encompasses a broad range of visual text processing datasets. Leveraging the advanced visual quality assessment capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we propose VTPScore, a novel evaluation metric designed to ensure fair and reliable evaluation. Our empirical study with more than 20 specific models reveals substantial room for improvement in the current techniques. Our aim is to establish this work as a fundamental resource that fosters future exploration and innovation in the dynamic field of visual text processing.

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) and structural features (SFs) are cornerstones for the link prediction task. However, as a common and intuitive mode of understanding, the potential of visual perception has been overlooked in the MPNN community. For the first time, we equip MPNNs with vision structural awareness by proposing an effective framework called Graph Vision Network (GVN), along with a more efficient variant (E-GVN). Extensive empirical results demonstrate that with the proposed frameworks, GVN consistently benefits from the vision enhancement across seven link prediction datasets, including challenging large-scale graphs. Such improvements are compatible with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and GVNs achieve new SOTA results, thereby underscoring a promising novel direction for link prediction.

<title>RB-SCD: A New Benchmark for Semantic Change Detection of Roads and Bridges in Traffic Scenes</title>

Abstract: With the rapid modernization of urban transportation, accurately detecting changes such as road and bridge construction, renovation, and demolition is crucial for urban planning and traffic management. However, existing methods often struggle to extract fine-grained semantic changes in complex traffic scenes, largely due to the lack of high-quality annotated change detection (CD) datasets. To address this, we introduce the Road and Bridge Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 260 pairs of high-resolution remote sensing images. RB-SCD spans diverse geographic areas and includes a wide variety of road and bridge types across over ten cities in multiple countries. It covers 11 distinct categories of semantic changes, enabling detailed structural and functional analysis. Based on this challenging dataset, we propose a novel framework called the Multimodal Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD). For the first time, MFDCD integrates multimodal feature characteristics in the frequency domain. It comprises two key components: the Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC) and the Textual Frequency Filter (TFF). DFC couples hierarchical visual features with wavelet-based frequency components, enhancing the perception of fine-grained and cross-temporal structural changes. TFF transforms textual features extracted by the CLIP model into the frequency domain via Fourier transform and applies graph-based filtering to extract salient frequency responses. These are then fused with visual features to enable effective multimodal representation learning. Extensive experiments show that MFDCD achieves strong performance on RB-SCD and three public benchmarks. The RB-SCD dataset, with its rich and diverse annotations, serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in road and bridge change detection under complex traffic conditions.

Abstract: A face morph is created by combining two face images corresponding to two identities to produce a composite that successfully matches both the constituent identities. Reference-free (RF) demorphing reverses this process using only the morph image, without the need for additional reference images. Previous RF demorphing methods are overly constrained, as they rely on assumptions about the distributions of training and testing morphs such as the morphing technique used (e.g., landmark-based) and face image style (e.g., passport photos). In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach, referred to as diffDeMorph, that effectively disentangles component images from a composite morph image with high visual fidelity. Our method is the first to generalize across morph techniques and face styles, beating the current state of the art by $\geq 59.46\%$ under a common training protocol across all datasets tested. We train our method on morphs created using synthetically generated face images and test on real morphs, thereby enhancing the practicality of the technique. Experiments on six datasets and two face matchers establish the utility and efficacy of our method.

Abstract: The success of the machine learning field has reliably depended on training on large datasets. While effective, this trend comes at an extraordinary cost. This is due to two deeply intertwined factors: the size of models and the size of datasets. While promising research efforts focus on reducing the size of models, the other half of the equation remains fairly mysterious. Indeed, it is surprising that the standard approach to training remains to iterate over and over, uniformly sampling the training dataset. In this paper we explore a series of alternative training paradigms that leverage insights from hard-data-mining and dropout, simple enough to implement and use that can become the new training standard. The proposed Progressive Data Dropout reduces the number of effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of the baseline. This savings actually do not come at any cost for accuracy. Surprisingly, the proposed method improves accuracy by up to 4.82%. Our approach requires no changes to model architecture or optimizer, and can be applied across standard training pipelines, thus posing an excellent opportunity for wide adoption.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data. However, traditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and target domains are known, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This leads to performance degradation if private classes exist. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of category settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low confidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to confusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP: UniDA-SS with Image Matching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework composed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based Distinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes, enabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the identification of common classes across domains. Second, Target-based Image Matching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels based on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective learning of common classes. We also introduce a new UniDA-SS benchmark and demonstrate through various experiments that UniMAP significantly outperforms baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/KU-VGI/UniMAP.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is essential in identifying GI tract abnormalities in order to detect diseases in their early stages and improve patient outcomes. Although deep learning has shown success in supporting GI diagnostics and decision-making, these models require curated datasets with labels that are expensive to acquire. Foundation models offer a promising solution by learning general-purpose representations, which can be finetuned for specific tasks, overcoming data scarcity. Developing foundation models for medical imaging holds significant potential, but the sensitive and protected nature of medical data presents unique challenges. Foundation model training typically requires extensive datasets, and while hospitals generate large volumes of data, privacy restrictions prevent direct data sharing, making foundation model training infeasible in most scenarios. In this work, we propose a FL framework for training foundation models for gastroendoscopy imaging, enabling data to remain within local hospital environments while contributing to a shared model. We explore several established FL algorithms, assessing their suitability for training foundation models without relying on task-specific labels, conducting experiments in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. We evaluate the trained foundation model on three critical downstream tasks--classification, detection, and segmentation--and demonstrate that it achieves improved performance across all tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in a federated, privacy-preserving setting.

Abstract: Humans can intuitively compose and arrange scenes in the 3D space for photography. However, can advanced AI image generators plan scenes with similar 3D spatial awareness when creating images from text or image prompts? We present GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline to comprehensively assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models. Furthermore, standard evaluations using general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently fail to capture the detailed spatial errors. To handle this challenge, we propose a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric, which reconstructs 3D scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models and provides a more accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness. Our findings show that while AI models create visually appealing images and can follow general instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement, relationships, and measurements. We summarize three core limitations in the spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models: 1) Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation and 3) Metric Measurement Adherence, highlighting possible directions for improving spatial intelligence in image generation.

Abstract: The capability to jointly process multi-modal information is becoming an essential task. However, the limited number of paired multi-modal data and the large computational requirements in multi-modal learning hinder the development. We propose a novel Tri-Modal Translation (TMT) model that translates between arbitrary modalities spanning speech, image, and text. We introduce a novel viewpoint, where we interpret different modalities as different languages, and treat multi-modal translation as a well-established machine translation problem. To this end, we tokenize speech and image data into discrete tokens, which provide a unified interface across modalities and significantly decrease the computational cost. In the proposed TMT, a multi-modal encoder-decoder conducts the core translation, whereas modality-specific processing is conducted only within the tokenization and detokenization stages. We evaluate the proposed TMT on all six modality translation tasks. TMT outperforms single model counterparts consistently, demonstrating that unifying tasks is beneficial not only for practicality but also for performance.

arXiv:2406.10737v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) seeks to adapt source pre-trained models to continually changing, unseen target domains. While existing CTTA methods assume structured domain changes with uniform durations, real-world environments often exhibit dynamic patterns where domains recur with varying frequencies and durations. Current approaches, which adapt the same parameters across different domains, struggle in such dynamic conditions-they face convergence issues with brief domain exposures, risk forgetting previously learned knowledge, or misapplying it to irrelevant domains. To remedy this, we propose DPCore, a method designed for robust performance across diverse domain change patterns while ensuring computational efficiency. DPCore integrates three key components: Visual Prompt Adaptation for efficient domain alignment, a Prompt Coreset for knowledge preservation, and a Dynamic Update mechanism that intelligently adjusts existing prompts for similar domains while creating new ones for substantially different domains. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that DPCore consistently outperforms various CTTA methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both structured and dynamic settings while reducing trainable parameters by 99% and computation time by 64% compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on extensive datasets can inadvertently learn biases by correlating gender information with specific objects or scenarios. Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically accounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively. Notably, the image encoder's contribution surpasses that of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation confirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are aligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender representations within the image encoder, which contributes most to the model bias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or increased computational demands.

<title>LDPM: Towards undersampled MRI reconstruction with MR-VAE and Latent Diffusion Prior</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models, as powerful generative models, have found a wide range of applications and shown great potential in solving image reconstruction problems. Some works attempted to solve MRI reconstruction with diffusion models, but these methods operate directly in pixel space, leading to higher computational costs for optimization and inference. Latent diffusion models, pre-trained on natural images with rich visual priors, are expected to solve the high computational cost problem in MRI reconstruction by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space. However, direct application to MRI reconstruction faces three key challenges: (1) absence of explicit control mechanisms for medical fidelity, (2) domain gap between natural images and MR physics, and (3) undefined data consistency in latent space. To address these challenges, a novel Latent Diffusion Prior-based undersampled MRI reconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. Our LDPM framework addresses these challenges by: (1) a sketch-guided pipeline with a two-step reconstruction strategy, which balances perceptual quality and anatomical fidelity, (2) an MRI-optimized VAE (MR-VAE), which achieves an improvement of approximately 3.92 dB in PSNR for undersampled MRI reconstruction compared to that with SD-VAE \cite{sd}, and (3) Dual-Stage Sampler, a modified version of spaced DDPM sampler, which enforces high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset\cite{fastmri} demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method and its robustness across various scenarios. The effectiveness of each module is also verified through ablation experiments.

Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We apply our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework, which can be efficiently applied for test-time network adaptation. Additionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient approach to accelerate both EI and Sketched-EI via optimizing only the normalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT and multicoil magnetic resonance image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant computational acceleration over standard EI counterpart in single-input setting and network adaptation at test time.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks. Despite great success, recent studies show that LVLMs encounter substantial limitations when engaging with visual graphs. To study the reason behind these limitations, we propose VGCure, a comprehensive benchmark covering 22 tasks for examining the fundamental graph understanding and reasoning capacities of LVLMs. Extensive evaluations conducted on 14 LVLMs reveal that LVLMs are weak in basic graph understanding and reasoning tasks, particularly those concerning relational or structurally complex information. Based on this observation, we propose a structure-aware fine-tuning framework to enhance LVLMs with structure learning abilities through three self-supervised learning tasks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LVLMs' performance on fundamental and downstream graph learning tasks, as well as enhancing their robustness against complex visual graphs.

Abstract: We introduce MedXpertQA, a highly challenging and comprehensive benchmark to evaluate expert-level medical knowledge and advanced reasoning. MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 18 leading models on \benchmark. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/MedXpertQA

Abstract: As AI becomes more closely integrated with peoples' daily activities, socially intelligent AI that can understand and interact seamlessly with humans in daily lives is increasingly important. However, current works in AI social reasoning all rely on language-only or language-dominant approaches to benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To address this limitation, we tap into a novel data source rich in nonverbal social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique challenges and opportunities in interpreting nonverbal social communication. We contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 8 hours of videos clips from YouTube and developing a comprehensive video question-answering benchmark comprising 806 carefully annotated and verified question-answer pairs, designed to probe nonverbal social reasoning capabilities. Using MimeQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that they achieve low overall accuracy, ranging from 20-30%, while humans score 86%. Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. We hope to inspire future work in AI models that embody true social intelligence capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.

Abstract: Early detection of cervical cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality by identifying precancerous lesions as soon as possible. As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased, leading to a growing demand for automated tools that can assist cytologists managing their rising workload. To address this, the Pap Smear Cell Classification Challenge (PS3C) has been organized in association with ISBI in 2025. This project aims to promote the development of automated tools for pap smear images classification. The analyzed images are grouped into four categories: healthy, unhealthy, both, and rubbish images which are considered as unsuitable for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a two-stage ensemble approach: first, a neural network determines whether an image is rubbish or not. If not, a second neural network classifies the image as containing a healthy cell, an unhealthy cell, or both.

Abstract: Generative retrieval is an emerging approach in information retrieval that generates identifiers (IDs) of target data based on a query, providing an efficient alternative to traditional embedding-based retrieval methods. However, existing models are task-specific and fall short of embedding-based retrieval in performance. This paper proposes GENIUS, a universal generative retrieval framework supporting diverse tasks across multiple modalities and domains. At its core, GENIUS introduces modality-decoupled semantic quantization, transforming multimodal data into discrete IDs encoding both modality and semantics. Moreover, to enhance generalization, we propose a query augmentation that interpolates between a query and its target, allowing GENIUS to adapt to varied query forms. Evaluated on the M-BEIR benchmark, it surpasses prior generative methods by a clear margin. Unlike embedding-based retrieval, GENIUS consistently maintains high retrieval speed across database size, with competitive performance across multiple benchmarks. With additional re-ranking, GENIUS often achieves results close to those of embedding-based methods while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that accelerates the discovery of actionable relationships in high-dimensional temporal data by integrating machine learning (ML), explainable AI (XAI), and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance data quality and streamline workflows. Traditional methods often fail to recognize complex temporal relationships, leading to noisy, redundant, or biased datasets. Our approach combines ML-driven pruning to identify and mitigate low-quality samples, XAI-based interpretability to validate critical feature interactions, and NLP for future contextual validation, reducing the time required to uncover actionable insights by 40-60%. Evaluated on real-world agricultural and synthetic datasets, the framework significantly improves performance metrics (e.g., MSE, R2, MAE) and computational efficiency, with hardware-agnostic scalability across diverse platforms. While long-term real-world impacts (e.g., cost savings, sustainability gains) are pending, this methodology provides an immediate pathway to accelerate data-centric AI in dynamic domains like agriculture and energy, enabling faster iteration cycles for domain experts.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disease that causes pain and mobility issues. While MRI-based deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in predicting total knee replacement (TKR) and disease progression, their generalizability remains challenging, particularly when applied to imaging data from different sources. In this study, we have shown that replacing batch normalization with instance normalization, using data augmentation, and applying contrastive loss improves model generalization in a baseline deep learning model for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction. We trained and evaluated our model using MRI data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, considering sagittal fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (FS-IW-TSE) images as the source domain and sagittal fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) dual-echo in steady state (DESS) images as the target domain. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy across both domains, with our approach outperforming the baseline model.

Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/mar-cry/Ophora.

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8 Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++ achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases represent a clinically significant burden, necessitating precise diagnostic approaches to optimize patient outcomes. Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&amp;E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new task of reading recognition to determine when a user is reading, essential for contextual AI in smart glasses. A large-scale dataset, Reading in the Wild, is presented, containing 100 hours of diverse reading and non-reading videos. Three modalities (egocentric RGB, eye gaze, head pose) are identified for solving the task, with a transformer model performing efficiently using these modalities individually or combined. The relevance and complementarity of these modalities to the task are demonstrated, along with strategies for encoding each modality effectively.

Abstract: To enable egocentric contextual AI in always-on smart glasses, it is crucial to be able to keep a record of the user's interactions with the world, including during reading. In this paper, we introduce a new task of reading recognition to determine when the user is reading. We first introduce the first-of-its-kind large-scale multimodal Reading in the Wild dataset, containing 100 hours of reading and non-reading videos in diverse and realistic scenarios. We then identify three modalities (egocentric RGB, eye gaze, head pose) that can be used to solve the task, and present a flexible transformer model that performs the task using these modalities, either individually or combined. We show that these modalities are relevant and complementary to the task, and investigate how to efficiently and effectively encode each modality. Additionally, we show the usefulness of this dataset towards classifying types of reading, extending current reading understanding studies conducted in constrained settings to larger scale, diversity and realism.

Summary:<br /><br />Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by tackling vision-language tasks with diverse requirements. This study introduces a systematic post-training framework for MLLMs using RLVR, focusing on optimizing dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. The framework includes a curated dataset of verifiable vision-language problems and a multi-domain RLVR setup with different rewards. A data mixture strategy is proposed to predict the fine-tuning outcome and optimize the best mixture for training. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the MLLM's general reasoning capabilities. The best mixture strategy boosts the accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by 5.24% compared to uniform data mixture and by 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers. Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such, training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets, highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture. Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

Abstract: Although chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) have driven breakthroughs in NLP, their integration into generative vision models remains underexplored. We introduce ReasonGen-R1, a two-stage framework that first imbues an autoregressive image generator with explicit text-based "thinking" skills via supervised fine-tuning on a newly generated reasoning dataset of written rationales, and then refines its outputs using Group Relative Policy Optimization. To enable the model to reason through text before generating images, We automatically generate and release a corpus of model crafted rationales paired with visual prompts, enabling controlled planning of object layouts, styles, and scene compositions. Our GRPO algorithm uses reward signals from a pretrained vision language model to assess overall visual quality, optimizing the policy in each update. Evaluations on GenEval, DPG, and the T2I benchmark demonstrate that ReasonGen-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines and prior state-of-the-art models. More: aka.ms/reasongen.

Abstract: Making neural visual generative models controllable by logical reasoning systems is promising for improving faithfulness, transparency, and generalizability. We propose the Abductive visual Generation (AbdGen) approach to build such logic-integrated models. A vector-quantized symbol grounding mechanism and the corresponding disentanglement training method are introduced to enhance the controllability of logical symbols over generation. Furthermore, we propose two logical abduction methods to make our approach require few labeled training data and support the induction of latent logical generative rules from data. We experimentally show that our approach can be utilized to integrate various neural generative models with logical reasoning systems, by both learning from scratch or utilizing pre-trained models directly.

Summary: 
Efficient attention implementation is crucial for large models with quadratic time complexity. The SpargeAttn method proposed in this paper offers a universal sparse and quantized attention solution for any model. It employs a two-stage online filter to predict and skip matrix multiplications in the attention map, significantly accelerating diverse models such as language, image, and video generation. SpargeAttn ensures both speedup and end-to-end performance without sacrificing metrics. The method is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.

<div> Adversarial training, dynamic epsilon scheduling, perturbation budget, instance-specific robustness, deep neural networks.<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES) as a novel framework for adaptive adversarial training in deep neural networks. DES adjusts the perturbation budget on a per-instance and per-iteration basis by considering the distance to the decision boundary, prediction confidence, and model uncertainty. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that DES improves both adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon baselines and prior adaptive methods. The theoretical analysis provided in the paper offers insights into the stability and convergence of the proposed scheduling policy. DES represents a significant advancement in instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods, offering a more effective and dynamic approach to defending against adversarial attacks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.04263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy, and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

Summary: 
Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting (RSVP) introduces a new framework that combines multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding. RSVP consists of two stages: reasoning-driven localization and segmentation refinement, utilizing multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to enhance visual grounding. The framework integrates textual and visual cues to generate precise segmentation masks through a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM). By explicitly modeling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and segmentation, RSVP enables MLLMs to reason about objects and generate structured visual representations. Experimental results show that RSVP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg and 49.7 mAP on SegInW under zero-shot settings. RSVP is validated as an effective framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting (RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM), seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding.

Summary:
- The Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB) introduces 92 sub-tasks for structured visual reasoning across multiple images.
- These tasks evaluate spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning with multi-solution annotations.
- The benchmark is designed to assess the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in reasoning over multiple images.
- Baseline experiments on 40 MLLMs show that open-source models are behind commercial ones in multi-image reasoning tasks.
- Multimodal reward models struggle with multi-image reward ranking tasks, highlighting a current limitation in the field.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the $\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$, including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Summary:
In the field of 3D human generation, challenges persist in achieving fine detail, realistic rendering of hands and faces, and control over appearance from text prompts. Existing methods struggle with diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data, inhibiting the development of foundational 3D human models. To address these issues, a weakly supervised pipeline is proposed. Firstly, a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes is generated using an image diffusion model. Secondly, an efficient mapping approach from image features to 3D point clouds is introduced utilizing a transformer-based architecture. Finally, a point-cloud diffusion model conditioned on text prompts is trained. This pipeline achieves significant speed-ups in 3D human generation compared to current approaches, improving text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail, accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality. We will make the code and dataset available.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000 questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation, and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment, location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200 randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems, offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification.

<div> Keywords: world modeling, procedural planning, AI benchmark, video-based, action recognition

Summary:
The paper introduces a new benchmark called WorldPrediction that evaluates the world modeling and procedural planning capabilities of AI agents. Unlike previous benchmarks that focus on low-level tasks, WorldPrediction emphasizes actions with temporal and semantic abstraction. The benchmark tasks include distinguishing the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or ordered sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from distractors based on initial and final world states. Visual observations are used to represent states and actions, with "action equivalents" provided to prevent models from exploiting background cues. Grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, the benchmark ensures reliability and robustness of evaluation. Human filtering and validation show that current AI models struggle to achieve high accuracy on WorldPrediction tasks compared to humans. WorldPrediction aims to push the frontier of AI research by testing world modeling and procedural planning capabilities in diverse environments.

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models, especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning, WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel approach called PLUCC for detecting the puck in ice hockey broadcast videos. PLUCC leverages contextual cues derived from player behavior, such as body orientation and gaze direction, to improve detection accuracy. It comprises three main components: a contextual encoder, a feature pyramid encoder, and a gating decoder with a channel gating mechanism. In addition to traditional evaluation metrics like average precision, a new metric called Rink Space Localization Error (RSLE) is proposed to account for perspective bias in rink space evaluation. Experimental results on the PuckDataset show that PLUCC outperforms existing methods, with a 12.2% improvement in average precision and a 25% improvement in RSLE average precision. The study highlights the importance of contextual understanding in enhancing puck detection performance and its potential applications in automated sports analysis. <div>

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance, surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of 12.2\% and RSLE average precision of 25\%. Our research demonstrates the critical role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with broad implications for automated sports analysis.

<div> video transformer architectures, Sign Language Recognition, BdSL dataset, data augmentation techniques, model performance

Summary:
The study focuses on Sign Language Recognition (SLR) using state-of-the-art video transformer architectures on the Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) dataset. Fine-tuning models such as VideoMAE, ViViT, and TimeSformer on BdSLW60 and BdSLW401 datasets showed significant improvements in accuracy compared to traditional approaches. Data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance model robustness. Evaluation through cross-validation and signer-independent testing revealed the superiority of video transformer models in recognizing BdSL signs. Factors like dataset size, video quality, and model architecture influenced performance, with the VideoMAE variant achieving highest accuracies. The results demonstrate the potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition using advanced deep learning techniques. <div>

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT, and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in 9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401 sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets, including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set, while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics) achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60 dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

<div> fMRI, deep neural networks, activation maximization, visual cortex, brain responses
Summary: 
An approach using activation maximization on deep neural network-based encoding models of the human brain is presented in this study. By adapting activations from a pretrained Inception V3 network and using linear regression to predict fMRI responses, a full image-computable model of brain responses is created. Utilizing activation maximization, images optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels are generated, showing visual characteristics corresponding to known selectivity. This method is extended to whole regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain and tested with human participants in an fMRI study, demonstrating reliable driving of activity in targeted regions. The results showcase the efficacy of activation maximization applied to DNN-based encoding models, offering flexible characterization and modulation of responses across the human visual system. <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models, our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses across the human visual system.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, image protection, perturbation, misinformation, editing

Summary:
Diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can be used for image generation but also misused for spreading misinformation and plagiarizing copyrighted materials. Current image protection methods use perturbations to obstruct diffusion-based editing, aiming to create noisy and unrelated images when edited. However, experiments show that these methods do not completely achieve this goal. In many cases, protected images can still be edited to generate desirable outputs that closely match the guidance prompt. Adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with text prompts during the generation process, resulting in unintended consequences such as better edits. Therefore, perturbation-based methods may not offer sufficient protection against diffusion-based editing for robust image protection. <div>

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios, diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.

<div> filter normalization, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, atmosphere-equivariant, generalization

Summary:
This article introduces the concept of filter normalization in deep learning to address the absence of normalization in convolutional filters learned end-to-end in deep networks. By applying classical filtering principles and incorporating learnable scaling and shifting similar to batch normalization, the proposed method ensures that filters are atmosphere-equivariant, leading to improved outcomes in the presence of atmospheric transfer. The study demonstrates significant improvements on intensity variation benchmarks for both artificial and natural images, with the ResNet34 model even surpassing CLIP by a substantial margin. The analysis highlights that unnormalized filters can degrade performance, while filter normalization promotes diversity, improves robustness, and enhances generalization in deep learning models dependent on convolution. <div>
arXiv:2506.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer, their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and generalization.

<div> Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), Image Generation, Next-Scale Prediction, Masked Prediction, Image Quality <br />
Summary: <br />
Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR) is developed as a new image generation algorithm that improves on Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR). By reformulating next-scale prediction and utilizing masked prediction, HMAR generates high-quality images quickly with a controllable multi-step procedure. HMAR achieves performance on par with VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines on ImageNet benchmarks. Efficient block-sparse attention kernels enable HMAR to train and infer over 2.5x and 1.75x faster than VAR, with a lower memory footprint. Additionally, HMAR offers greater flexibility, allowing for changes in the sampling schedule without the need for retraining, and enabling zero-shot application to image editing tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.04421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions. When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally, HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner.

Summary:
This paper explores challenges in using egocentric devices for photorealistic scene reconstruction in high dynamic range. The study highlights the importance of utilizing visual-inertial bundle adjustment for precise calibration of rolling shutter RGB cameras. By incorporating a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting, the sensor characteristics and dynamic ranges can be effectively addressed. Evaluation using the Project Aria and Meta Quest3 devices demonstrates a consistent visual enhancement with a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio. The findings showcase the benefits of accurate camera calibration and image formation modeling for improved photoreal reconstruction in various lighting conditions. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and recording profile are available at http://www.projectaria.com/photoreal-reconstruction/

<div> Keywords: face recognition, pose invariance, defrontalization, facial feature extraction, training dataset

Summary:
In this work, a new method called face defrontalization is proposed to enhance pose-invariant face recognition by training a model on frontal-profile pairs dataset. This method does not introduce any time overhead during inference and involves training a face defrontalization FFWM model and a ResNet-50 facial feature extraction model. The approach was evaluated on various open-access datasets, showing improved results compared to models without defrontalization. The proposed method outperforms existing face frontalization methods on larger datasets, highlighting potential overfitting issues of current approaches on smaller datasets. However, for extreme poses in the Multi-PIE dataset, the proposed method did not show clear superiority. This suggests the need for further research to address challenges in achieving pose invariance in face recognition systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance, current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses (75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

Summary: 
FALO is a hardware-friendly approach to LiDAR 3D object detection, offering high accuracy and fast inference speed. It arranges sparse 3D voxels into a 1D sequence for efficient processing. The ConvDotMix blocks in FALO utilize large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers to enhance spatial and embedding feature interaction. Implicit grouping balances tensor dimensions for efficient inference and accounts for the increasing receptive field. FALO is designed for deployment on compact, embedded devices and achieves competitive performance on benchmarks like nuScenes and Waymo. It outperforms the latest SOTA methods on mobile GPUs and NPUs by a speedup factor of 1.6 to 9.8. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a 1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features. Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit (NPU).

<div> Keywords: deepfake detection, language guidance, vision encoder, statistical artifacts, data uncertainty learning

Summary:
In this paper, the authors propose a new deepfake detection technique called AuthGuard that enhances generalization by incorporating language guidance for human-like commonsense reasoning. By training an expert deepfake vision encoder using image-text contrastive learning with few-shot prompting, the proposed framework is able to extract both language-describable deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts. By integrating data uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, noise in image-text supervision is mitigated, resulting in improved robustness. AuthGuard achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, outperforming existing techniques on the DFDC and DF40 datasets. The framework also enhances deepfake reasoning, as demonstrated by a significant improvement in performance on the DDVQA dataset. Overall, AuthGuard provides a comprehensive and effective solution for detecting deepfake content. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable, commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework, AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15% on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on the DDVQA dataset.

<div> propose, pruning, deep learning, neural networks, efficiency
Summary:
The article introduces a new method for pruning structures in deep learning models to improve computational efficiency. Unlike existing techniques that focus on removing either neurons or layers, the proposed method can simultaneously prune different structures within a model. By selecting the subnetwork with the highest representation similarity to its parent using the Centered Kernel Alignment metric, the method creates highly sparse models that maintain predictive performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach outperforms current layer and filter pruning techniques, achieving significant reduction in Floating Point Operations with minimal loss of accuracy. Notably, the method shows improvements on popular architectures like ResNet56 and ResNet110, with up to 95.82% FLOPs reduction. Moreover, the pruned models exhibit robustness to adversarial and out-of-distribution samples, and contribute to GreenAI by reducing carbon emissions up to 83.31%. This work marks a significant advancement in model pruning techniques. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks. However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore, simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once, we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent (the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82% FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI, reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT) module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\% detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial 33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

<div> Learnable Separable Kernels, SISR, image frequency components, reduction of parameters, computational load <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs) as a plug-and-play module for single-image super-resolution tasks, directly enhancing image frequency components. LSKs are designed as rank-one matrices, reducing parameters and computational requirements by over 60%. Decomposing LSKs into orthogonal one-dimensional kernels leads to improved model performance. Feature map analysis shows effective enhancement of image frequency components. Models incorporating LSKs outperform baseline methods, especially with higher upscaling factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of LSKs in reducing parameters and computational load while enhancing overall model performance. <div>

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance. Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

<div> Keywords: slow-thinking language models, multi-modal large language models, visual grounding, reinforcement learning, reasoning objective

Summary: 
Recent advancements in slow-thinking language models like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks by emulating reflective human-like cognition. However, extending these abilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) poses challenges due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading the underlying reasoner LLMs. The proposed solution, RACRO, decouples perception from reasoning by optimizing captioning behavior through reasoning-guided reinforcement learning. This approach enhances visual grounding and generates reasoning-optimized representations. By closing the perception-reasoning loop, RACRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal math and science benchmarks while allowing for superior scalability and easy adaptation to advanced reasoning LLMs without costly re-alignment. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this, we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal re-alignment.

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Summary:<br />
- Follow-Your-Creation is a new 4D video creation framework that can generate and edit 4D content from a single monocular video input.
- It leverages a video inpainting model as a generative prior, making 4D video creation a video inpainting task to fill in missing content due to camera trajectory changes or user edits.
- The model is trained on composite masked inpainting video data generated from depth-based point cloud rendering and editing masks, allowing for diverse and challenging inpainting scenarios.
- A self-iterative tuning strategy gradually increases viewing angles during training for temporal consistency under large camera motion.
- A temporal packaging module is introduced during inference to improve generation quality and support prompt-based content editing, outperforming existing methods in quality and versatility. <div>
arXiv:2506.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task, enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance, enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both quality and versatility.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) for embodied intelligence, focusing on high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. The approach divides the agent's learning process into high-level instructions and low-level actions, defining five sub-setups.

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks, preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt. While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance, making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications. Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel two-stage framework named Perfecting Depth for enhancing sensor depth.

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research. By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies, this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

The STARE benchmark assesses multimodal large language models on tasks that require multi-step visual simulations, covering various spatial reasoning challenges. While models perform well on simpler 2D transformations, they struggle with more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles. Humans achieve high accuracy on these tasks but speed up significantly with intermediate visual simulations. Models show inconsistent gains from visual simulations, highlighting a need for improved leveraging of visual information.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning, neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up (down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0 Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage intermediate visual information.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation, with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism.

<div> representation learning, neural networks, feature extraction, object segmentation, Galois algebra theory

Summary:
This article introduces a new method for representation learning without supervision, inspired by human development. The traditional assumption of disentangled feature axes is challenged, as it fails to consider conditional independence. The authors propose a novel approach based on group decomposition in Galois algebra theory. However, the initial method was limited to low-resolution images with no background. To address this, the authors present a modified technique combining feature extraction and object segmentation. This allows for the application of group decomposition theory to realistic scenarios, improving the understanding of human object recognition. By replacing pixel translation with feature translation and grouping features based on transformations, the proposed model shows promise in acquiring meaningful representations in real-world environments. <div>
arXiv:2506.04668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision. Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence. To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background, which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background. We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human development of object recognition in the real world.

<div> Few-Shot Prototypical Concept Classification, Mixture of LoRA Experts, concept guidance, multi-level feature preservation, geometry-aware concept discrimination loss<br />
Summary:<br />
The proposed Few-Shot Prototypical Concept Classification framework addresses challenges in low-data settings by balancing parameters and aligning representation patterns. Leveraging Mixture of LoRA Experts allows for efficient parameter adaptation. Cross-module concept guidance ensures alignment between feature representations and concept activation patterns. A multi-level feature preservation strategy enriches representations by fusing spatial and semantic cues. A geometry-aware concept discrimination loss encourages orthogonal concepts for clearer decision boundaries. Experimental results on six benchmarks show significant performance improvement, with 4.2%-8.7% relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification. The approach combines concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve higher accuracy and model interpretability, paving the way for more transparent visual recognition systems.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts, encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7% relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more transparent visual recognition systems.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Vision Large Language Models, data generation, synthetic data, instance segmentation

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a novel data generation framework called Gen-n-Val, which combines Layer Diffusion (LD), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) to produce high-quality synthetic data for computer vision tasks. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: the LD prompt agent and the data validation agent. The LD prompt agent optimizes prompts for LD to generate single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and clean backgrounds, while the data validation agent filters out low-quality synthetic images. The system prompts are refined through TextGrad, and image harmonization is used to combine multiple instances within scenes. Compared to existing methods, Gen-n-Val reduces invalid synthetic data and improves performance on COCO instance segmentation and object detection benchmarks. It shows significant improvements over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks as well. <div>

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However, current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Summary: 
MARS is a new method introduced to accurately reconstruct radio maps from sparse measurements, crucial for applications in smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning. Traditional techniques like interpolation and inpainting lack environmental awareness, while deep learning approaches often rely on detailed scene data and struggle with generalization. MARS, however, combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections to enhance global and local feature extraction, thereby improving reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results across various scenes and antenna locations demonstrate that MARS outperforms baseline models in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) while maintaining low computational cost. This highlights the practical potential of MARS in effectively and efficiently reconstructing radio maps.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Summary: 
The article introduces HoliSafe, a comprehensive safety dataset and benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), addressing the limitations of current approaches. It covers all safe/unsafe image-text combinations to enhance training and evaluation, aiming to prevent jailbreak attacks and improve safety in unseen configurations. SafeLLaVA, a new VLM model, incorporates a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head to encode harmful visual cues and offer interpretable harmfulness classification. The model, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance on multiple benchmarks. The HoliSafe benchmark also identifies vulnerabilities in existing VLM models, highlighting the importance of robust and interpretable safety measures in VLMs. These advancements aim to drive further research in enhancing VLM safety and expanding multimodal alignment possibilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Summary:
Linearly decodable features representative of ImageNet classes are found in the residual stream of the LlaVA-Next model, showcasing the multimodal capabilities of models trained on embeddings of visual inputs. Targeted edits on the model output demonstrate the causal nature of these features. Training multimodal Sparse Autoencoders results in a dictionary of highly interpretable text and image features, enhancing the diversity of studied linear features. Despite initial disjoint representations across modalities, model representations become more shared in deeper layers, suggesting convergence towards a unified representation space. <div>

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become increasingly shared in deeper layers.

<div> Keywords: Pretrained VLMs, Few-shot adaptation, OOD generalization, Finetuning, Augmentation techniques

Summary: 
Finetuning with proper hyperparameters outperforms prompt tuning and linear probing for VLM adaptation. Visual encoder-only finetuning is more efficient and accurate than contrastive finetuning both visual and textual encoders. Finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder balances ID and OOD accuracy best. Retrieval augmentation boosts OOD accuracy, while adversarial perturbation enhances robustness during finetuning. Naively combining both techniques sacrifices overall ID and OOD accuracy. To address this, SRAPF, a two-stage process of partial finetuning and adversarial partial finetuning, is proposed. SRAPF achieves state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on ImageNet OOD benchmarks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID) task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation, aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation, and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning. Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD benchmarks.

arXiv:2506.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects, such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks. Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

<div> label-aligned transfer, object detection, dataset integration, class semantics, bounding box annotations 

Summary:
Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT) is introduced as a framework that aims to improve generalization in object detection by integrating multiple datasets with different label taxonomies and annotation inconsistencies. LAT first trains dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then combined with ground-truth annotations using a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG) to address spatial inconsistencies. A Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module further refines region features by injecting class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals. This approach allows for many-to-one label space transfer across heterogeneous datasets, aligning both class-level misalignments and bounding box inconsistencies. LAT does not rely on shared label spaces or manual annotations, preserving dataset-specific annotation granularity while achieving improved detection performance in the target domain. Across various benchmarks, LAT consistently outperforms semi-supervised baselines, demonstrating gains of up to +4.8AP. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT), a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector. LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations. Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over semi-supervised baselines.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, backdoor attacks, reinforcement learning, semantic fidelity, multimodal generative models <br />
Summary:<br />
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where attackers can manipulate the model to generate malicious captions. This is problematic due to the stealthiness and cross-modal nature of the attacks. The proposed solution, Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), employs a reinforcement learning framework to counter these attacks without prior knowledge of triggers. By disrupting the activation of malicious pathways through perturbations, SRD aims to reduce attack success rates to 5.6% while maintaining caption quality on clean inputs with minimal performance drop. Using a semantic fidelity score as a reward signal, SRD guides the agent to generate robust yet faithful captions, addressing abnormal attention concentration and semantic incoherence in the generated captions. SRD offers an interpretable defense against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal generative models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1) abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g., occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic, interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal generative models.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning. Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream.

Our approach also features a novel optimization objective ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

Summary:<br />
In this study, the focus is on improving multi-modal reasoning in large language models using smaller high-value datasets. The authors introduce a novel data selection paradigm called Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP) that identifies cognitive samples triggering genuine multi-modal reasoning. RAP includes two estimators, Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) and Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE), to select samples based on their potential to stimulate reasoning and discard language priors. Additionally, a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) replaces trivial instances with more challenging ones to ensure robust multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning. Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing computational costs by over 43%.

<div> photometric relation, monocular depth learning, SSIM, unsupervised, optimization

Summary:
This work introduces a new form of the SSIM function for unsupervised monocular depth learning, focusing on improving training performance. The proposed SSIM form incorporates luminance, contrast, and structural similarity components through addition rather than multiplication, resulting in smoother gradients during training. Extensive experiments are conducted to optimize the parameters of the new SSIM function, showing significant performance improvements compared to the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset. By utilizing the optimized SSIM loss function within the MonoDepth framework, this approach enhances the accuracy of unsupervised depth estimation tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

<div> Keywords: Visual Place Recognition, Perspective-to-Equirectangular formulation, Hyperbolic space, Hierarchical feature aggregation, Coarse-to-fine search strategy

Summary: 
HypeVPR is a novel hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space designed for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using the perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation. The framework leverages the hierarchical structures present in visual environments captured by panoramic views. It employs hyperbolic space to represent feature relationships hierarchically and preserve distance properties within the feature space. HypeVPR introduces a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within hyperbolic space. Additionally, it adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine search strategy to balance speed and accuracy in matching descriptors from different image types. This approach allows HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods and achieve up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse benchmark datasets. The code and models for HypeVPR will be made available on GitHub at https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.

<br />
Summary: Object-X is a versatile framework for multi-modal object representation in 3D space. It encodes rich object embeddings from images, point clouds, and text, and decodes them into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions. By grounding modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding, Object-X enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction and supports various tasks such as scene alignment, single-image 3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on real-world datasets show that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view synthesis, improves geometric accuracy, and achieves competitive performance in scene alignment and localization. Importantly, Object-X significantly reduces storage requirements compared to traditional approaches, making it a scalable and practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation. <div>
arXiv:2506.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings (e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image 3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization. Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches, establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

arXiv:2506.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g., homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e., the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation. SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code: https://github.com/danini/superansac

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented 97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3) Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern recognition.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range. However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR), addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic lights.

<title>DualX-VSR: Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution without Motion Compensation</title>

arXiv:2506.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision, which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data. We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions, without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess, the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in 3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model, OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models' capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost, high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models. Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians. To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments, poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just individual animal re-identification.

<title>Time-Lapse Video-Based Embryo Grading via Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern Mining</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists' overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists' evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

<title>Robustness as Architecture: Designing IQA Models to Withstand Adversarial Perturbations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04951</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust. Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses -- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through data to engineering it through design.

<title>APVR: Hour-Level Long Video Understanding with Adaptive Pivot Visual Information Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04953</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR (Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames. This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing MLLM architectures.

<title>FEAT: Full-Dimensional Efficient Attention Transformer for Medical Video Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04956</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations, including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only 23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at https://github.com/Yaziwel/FEAT.

<title>Bringing SAM to new heights: Leveraging elevation data for tree crown segmentation from drone imagery</title>

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2) temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM) information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations. We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree crown instance segmentation models.

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering (ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes, making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories (e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds, enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding capabilities.

<title>Multi-scale Image Super Resolution with a Single Auto-Regressive Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04990</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04990</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However, due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model (300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to +3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world applications.

<title>Beyond Cropped Regions: New Benchmark and Corresponding Baseline for Chinese Scene Text Retrieval in Diverse Layouts</title>

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene text retrieval.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth features from some well-annotated datasets \cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem \cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors \cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of 91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios, particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs. Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans. We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual sharpness.

arXiv:2506.05026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation, enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and coherent video editing without inversion.

Abstract: Vietnamese document analysis and recognition (DAR) is a crucial field with applications in digitization, information retrieval, and automation. Despite advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions, including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage community-driven solutions.

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22], which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0 on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%, compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1 score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies. Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions: for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence and deployment of Emotion AI-powered facial affect analysis (FAA) tools, concerns about the trustworthiness of these systems have become more prominent. This first workshop on "Towards Trustworthy Facial Affect Analysis: Advancing Insights of Fairness, Explainability, and Safety (TrustFAA)" aims to bring together researchers who are investigating different challenges in relation to trustworthiness-such as interpretability, uncertainty, biases, and privacy-across various facial affect analysis tasks, including macro/ micro-expression recognition, facial action unit detection, other corresponding applications such as pain and depression detection, as well as human-robot interaction and collaboration. In alignment with FG2025's emphasis on ethics, as demonstrated by the inclusion of an Ethical Impact Statement requirement for this year's submissions, this workshop supports FG2025's efforts by encouraging research, discussion and dialogue on trustworthy FAA.

<title>Astraea: A GPU-Oriented Token-wise Acceleration Framework for Video Diffusion Transformers</title>

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs) while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods (<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

<title>DIMCIM: A Quantitative Evaluation Framework for Default-mode Diversity and Generalization in Text-to-Image Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity ("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters. DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of model performance.

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors. Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets. Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore, we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli. CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving human-level accuracy.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7 hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR) human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/Through-the-Wall-Radar-Human-Activity-Recognition-Without-Using-Neural-Networks.

<title>Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.

<title>Single GPU Task Adaptation of Pathology Foundation Models for Whole Slide Image Analysis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05184</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images, necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer (\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

<title>MokA: Multimodal Low-Rank Adaptation for MLLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05191</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2, Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations, especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment, far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in complex and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore, we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

<title>Grounding Beyond Detection: Enhancing Contextual Understanding in Embodied 3D Grounding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05199</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection? To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly, these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation, strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions. Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

<title>OGGSplat: Open Gaussian Growing for Generalizable Reconstruction with Expanded Field-of-View</title>

arXiv:2506.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

<title>Follow-Your-Motion: Video Motion Transfer via Efficient Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Finetuning</title>

arXiv:2506.05207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the 3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion.

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand, explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g., large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?" (recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach, we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL (72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR.

<title>SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains. Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs. ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1) Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework, using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models. Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over 12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a different robot platform.

<title>LeanPO: Lean Preference Optimization for Likelihood Alignment in Video-LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05260</link>

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta (y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training, inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs, showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient Video-LLMs.

<title>Can Foundation Models Generalise the Presentation Attack Detection Capabilities on ID Cards?</title>

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD) on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two, or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets. One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide images are the key to generalisation.

<title>From Play to Replay: Composed Video Retrieval for Temporally Fine-Grained Videos</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05274</link>

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct each  pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image, video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR, TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

<title>Unifying Appearance Codes and Bilateral Grids for Driving Scene Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.

<title>Rectified Point Flow: Generic Point Cloud Pose Estimation</title>

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy.

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically, given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance.

<title>Stable Vision Concept Transformers for Medical Diagnosis</title>

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer (VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field. To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus meeting the needs of the medical field.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially, EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore, by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35, surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling speed. The code and weights are available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/alitok.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration, extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored, particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2, which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically, an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses, including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a single step.

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2 by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs, including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision, localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations, including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual understanding.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our experiments.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic, transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass and applicability to painting.

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data, however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable, real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization, directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity, leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state, and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding.

<title>Does Your 3D Encoder Really Work? When Pretrain-SFT from 2D VLMs Meets 3D VLMs</title>

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures, allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis. This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map, our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results.

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with 1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been realeased on https://av-reasoner.github.io.

<title>MINT-CoT: Enabling Interleaved Visual Tokens in Mathematical Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT. However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset, containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline. We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by +34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around 9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60 minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs, spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action, scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets, VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.

arXiv:2506.05338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images. To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

<title>Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) tasks.

<title>SparseMM: Head Sparsity Emerges from Visual Concept Responses in MLLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at https://github.com/CR400AF-A/SparseMM.

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

<title>FreeTimeGS: Free Gaussians at Anytime and Anywhere for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

<title>VideoMathQA: Benchmarking Mathematical Reasoning via Multimodal Understanding in Videos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour. It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality, totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios, questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

<title>Contrastive Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g., class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows, enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs. We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x, (2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9 compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code at: https://github.com/gstoica27/DeltaFM.git.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000 meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect knowledge across fields.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles.

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO), indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters, which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made publicly available.

arXiv:2506.04362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions, which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications. Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while opening up several future directions. Our code is available at https://github.com/info-ucr/PEFTLeak.

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority. In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy under ambient illumination.

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free, handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh deformations.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples. StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality variations.

<title>Scaling Laws for Robust Comparison of Open Foundation Language-Vision Models and Datasets</title>

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT, that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost. Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases, we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

<title>VoxDet: Rethinking 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction as Dense Object Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04623</link>

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels: the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level, which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks: offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6 directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking 1st on the online leaderboard.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features. Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly under-resourced ones.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric transformation is observed.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability. This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis, developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs) through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA) system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping, and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and conducting comprehensive system validation.

Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts. An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35 different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally, the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around 38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection algorithms. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/mariomlz99/MineInsight.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks, while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/Cross-Class-Features-AT.

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution. Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable, image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data. Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training data.

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks, such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M, a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&amp;E-stained whole slide images covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation, improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to use H\&amp;E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&amp;E images. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling, existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset for brain tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Volumetric video, also known as hologram video, is a novel medium that portrays natural content in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.

Abstract: Deep learning is providing a wealth of new approaches to the problem of novel view synthesis, from Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) based approaches to end-to-end style architectures. Each approach offers specific strengths but also comes with limitations in their applicability. This work introduces ViewFusion, an end-to-end generative approach to novel view synthesis with unparalleled flexibility. ViewFusion consists in simultaneously applying a diffusion denoising step to any number of input views of a scene, then combining the noise gradients obtained for each view with an (inferred) pixel-weighting mask, ensuring that for each region of the target view only the most informative input views are taken into account. Our approach resolves several limitations of previous approaches by (1) being trainable and generalizing across multiple scenes and object classes, (2) adaptively taking in a variable number of pose-free views at both train and test time, (3) generating plausible views even in severely underdetermined conditions (thanks to its generative nature) -- all while generating views of quality on par or even better than comparable methods. Limitations include not generating a 3D embedding of the scene, resulting in a relatively slow inference speed, and our method only being tested on the relatively small Neural 3D Mesh Renderer dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/bronemos/view-fusion.

Abstract: Visual commonsense plays a vital role in understanding and reasoning about the visual world. While commonsense knowledge bases like ConceptNet provide structured collections of general facts, they lack visually grounded representations. Scene graph datasets like Visual Genome, though rich in object-level descriptions, primarily focus on directly observable information and lack systematic categorization of commonsense knowledge. We present Visual Commonsense Dataset (VCD), a large-scale dataset containing over 100,000 images and 14 million object-commonsense pairs that bridges this gap. VCD introduces a novel three-level taxonomy for visual commonsense, integrating both Seen (directly observable) and Unseen (inferrable) commonsense across Property, Action, and Space aspects. Each commonsense is represented as a triple where the head entity is grounded to object bounding boxes in images, enabling scene-dependent and object-specific visual commonsense representation. To demonstrate VCD's utility, we develop VCM, a generative model that combines a vision-language model with instruction tuning to discover diverse visual commonsense from images. Extensive evaluations demonstrate both the high quality of VCD and its value as a resource for advancing visually grounded commonsense understanding and reasoning. Our dataset and code will be released on https://github.com/NUSTM/VCD.

Abstract: Large repositories of image-caption pairs are essential for the development of vision-language models. However, these datasets are often extracted from noisy data scraped from the web, and contain many mislabeled instances. In order to improve the reliability of downstream models, it is important to identify and filter images with incorrect captions. However, beyond filtering based on image-caption embedding similarity, no prior works have proposed other methods to filter noisy multimodal data, or concretely assessed the impact of noisy captioning data on downstream training. In this work, we propose, theoretically justify, and empirically validate LEMoN, a method to identify label errors in image-caption datasets. Our method leverages the multimodal neighborhood of image-caption pairs in the latent space of contrastively pretrained multimodal models to automatically identify label errors. Through empirical evaluations across eight datasets and twelve baselines, we find that LEMoN outperforms the baselines by over 3% in label error detection, and that training on datasets filtered using our method improves downstream captioning performance by more than 2 BLEU points over noisy training.

Abstract: Text Recognition (TR) refers to the research area that focuses on retrieving textual information from images, a topic that has seen significant advancements in the last decade due to the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, these solutions often necessitate vast amounts of manually labeled or synthetic data. Addressing this challenge, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has gained attention by utilizing large datasets of unlabeled data to train DNN, thereby generating meaningful and robust representations. Although SSL was initially overlooked in TR because of its unique characteristics, recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of SSL methods specifically for this field. This rapid development, however, has led to many methods being explored independently, without taking previous efforts in methodology or comparison into account, thereby hindering progress in the field of research. This paper, therefore, seeks to consolidate the use of SSL in the field of TR, offering a critical and comprehensive overview of the current state of the art. We will review and analyze the existing methods, compare their results, and highlight inconsistencies in the current literature. This thorough analysis aims to provide general insights into the field, propose standardizations, identify new research directions, and foster its proper development.

<title>Detection-Driven Object Count Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Accurately controlling object count in text-to-image generation remains a key challenge. Supervised methods often fail, as training data rarely covers all count variations. Methods that manipulate the denoising process to add or remove objects can help; however, they still require labeled data, limit robustness and image quality, and rely on a slow, iterative process.
  Pre-trained differentiable counting models that rely on soft object density summation exist and could steer generation, but employing them presents three main challenges: (i) they are pre-trained on clean images, making them less effective during denoising steps that operate on noisy inputs; (ii) they are not robust to viewpoint changes; and (iii) optimization is computationally expensive, requiring repeated model evaluations per image.
  We propose a new framework that uses pre-trained object counting techniques and object detectors to guide generation. First, we optimize a counting token using an outer-loop loss computed on fully generated images. Second, we introduce a detection-driven scaling term that corrects errors caused by viewpoint and proportion shifts, among other factors, without requiring backpropagation through the detection model. Third, we show that the optimized parameters can be reused for new prompts, removing the need for repeated optimization. Our method provides efficiency through token reuse, flexibility via compatibility with various detectors, and accuracy with improved counting across diverse object categories.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged to address overfitting and high computational costs associated with fully fine-tuning in self-supervised learning. Mainstream PEFT methods add a few trainable parameters while keeping the pre-trained backbone parameters fixed. These methods achieve comparative, and often superior, performance to fully fine-tuning, demonstrating the powerful representation ability of the pre-trained backbone. Despite this success, these methods typically ignore the initialization of the new parameters, often relying solely on random initialization. We argue that if pre-training is significantly beneficial, it should be applied to all parameters requiring representational capacity. Motivated by this, we propose Target Parameter Pre-training (TPP), a simple yet effective fine-tuning framework. TPP pre-trains target parameters, i.e., the new parameters introduced during fine-tuning, in an additional stage before PEFT. During this stage, the pre-trained backbone parameters are frozen, and only the new parameters are trainable. A defined pretext task encourages the new parameters to learn specific representations of downstream data. Subsequently, when PEFT is employed, the pre-trained new parameters are loaded to enhance fine-tuning efficiency. The proposed TPP framework is versatile, allowing integration with various pre-trained backbones, pretext tasks, and PEFT methods. We evaluated the fine-tuning performance of our method on seven public datasets, covering four modalities and two task types. The results demonstrate that TPP can be easily integrated into existing PEFT methods, significantly improving performance.

Abstract: One-step text-to-image generator models offer advantages such as swift inference efficiency, flexible architectures, and state-of-the-art generation performance. In this paper, we study the problem of aligning one-step generator models with human preferences for the first time. Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), we formulate the alignment problem as maximizing expected human reward functions while adding an Integral Kullback-Leibler divergence term to prevent the generator from diverging. By overcoming technical challenges, we introduce Diff-Instruct++ (DI++), the first, fast-converging and image data-free human preference alignment method for one-step text-to-image generators. We also introduce novel theoretical insights, showing that using CFG for diffusion distillation is secretly doing RLHF with DI++. Such an interesting finding brings understanding and potential contributions to future research involving CFG. In the experiment sections, we align both UNet-based and DiT-based one-step generators using DI++, which use the Stable Diffusion 1.5 and the PixelArt-$\alpha$ as the reference diffusion processes. The resulting DiT-based one-step text-to-image model achieves a strong Aesthetic Score of 6.19 and an Image Reward of 1.24 on the COCO validation prompt dataset. It also achieves a leading Human preference Score (HPSv2.0) of 28.48, outperforming other open-sourced models such as Stable Diffusion XL, DMD2, SD-Turbo, as well as PixelArt-$\alpha$. Both theoretical contributions and empirical evidence indicate that DI++ is a strong human-preference alignment approach for one-step text-to-image models.

Abstract: We propose Diff-Instruct* (DI*), a data-efficient post-training approach for one-step text-to-image generative models to improve its human preferences without requiring image data. Our method frames alignment as online reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which optimizes the one-step model to maximize human reward functions while being regularized to be kept close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the Kullback-Leibler divergence as the regularization, we introduce a novel general score-based divergence regularization that substantially improves performance as well as post-training stability. Although the general score-based RLHF objective is intractable to optimize, we derive a strictly equivalent tractable loss function in theory that can efficiently compute its \emph{gradient} for optimizations. We introduce \emph{DI*-SDXL-1step}, which is a 2.6B one-step text-to-image model at a resolution of $1024\times 1024$, post-trained from DMD2 w.r.t SDXL. \textbf{Our 2.6B \emph{DI*-SDXL-1step} model outperforms the 50-step 12B FLUX-dev model} in ImageReward, PickScore, and CLIP score on the Parti prompts benchmark while using only 1.88\% of the inference time. This result clearly shows that with proper post-training, the small one-step model is capable of beating huge multi-step diffusion models. Our model is open-sourced at this link: https://github.com/pkulwj1994/diff_instruct_star. We hope our findings can contribute to human-centric machine learning techniques.

Abstract: The proliferation of disinformation demands reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. We present Dynamic Evidence-based FAct-checking with Multimodal Experts (DEFAME), a modular, zero-shot MLLM pipeline for open-domain, text-image claim verification. DEFAME operates in a six-stage process, dynamically selecting the tools and search depth to extract and evaluate textual and visual evidence. Unlike prior approaches that are text-only, lack explainability, or rely solely on parametric knowledge, DEFAME performs end-to-end verification, accounting for images in claims and evidence while generating structured, multimodal reports. Evaluation on the popular benchmarks VERITE, AVerITeC, and MOCHEG shows that DEFAME surpasses all previous methods, establishing itself as the new state-of-the-art fact-checking system for uni- and multimodal fact-checking. Moreover, we introduce a new multimodal benchmark, ClaimReview2024+, featuring claims after the knowledge cutoff of GPT-4o, avoiding data leakage. Here, DEFAME drastically outperforms the GPT-4o baselines, showing temporal generalizability and the potential for real-time fact-checking.

Abstract: Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the physical world understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image, and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and, shape and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or complex ray tracing.

Abstract: Scoring the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has witnessed growing interest. Existing benchmarks have highlighted the impressive performance of LMMs in text recognition; however, their abilities in certain challenging tasks, such as text localization, handwritten content extraction, and logical reasoning, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce OCRBench v2, a large-scale bilingual text-centric benchmark with currently the most comprehensive set of tasks (4x more tasks than the previous multi-scene benchmark OCRBench), the widest coverage of scenarios (31 diverse scenarios), and thorough evaluation metrics, with 10,000 human-verified question-answering pairs and a high proportion of difficult samples. Moreover, we construct a private test set with 1,500 manually annotated images. The consistent evaluation trends observed across both public and private test sets validate the OCRBench v2's reliability. After carefully benchmarking state-of-the-art LMMs, we find that most LMMs score below 50 (100 in total) and suffer from five-type limitations, including less frequently encountered text recognition, fine-grained perception, layout perception, complex element parsing, and logical reasoning.

Abstract: Advances in healthcare research have significantly enhanced our understanding of disease mechanisms, diagnostic precision, and therapeutic options. Yet, lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide due to challenges in early and accurate diagnosis. While current lung cancer detection models show promise, there is considerable potential for further improving the accuracy for timely intervention. To address this challenge, we introduce a hybrid deep convolution model leveraging transfer learning, named the Maximum Sensitivity Neural Network (MSNN). MSNN is designed to improve the precision of lung cancer detection by refining sensitivity and specificity. This model has surpassed existing deep learning approaches through experimental validation, achieving an accuracy of 98% and a sensitivity of 97%. By overlaying sensitivity maps onto lung Computed Tomography (CT) scans, it enables the visualization of regions most indicative of malignant or benign classifications. This innovative method demonstrates exceptional performance in distinguishing lung cancer with minimal false positives, thereby enhancing the accuracy of medical diagnoses.

Abstract: Creating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models requires significant expertise and effort. Text-to-CAD, which converts textual descriptions into CAD parametric sequences, is crucial in streamlining this process. Recent studies have utilized ground-truth parametric sequences, known as sequential signals, as supervision to achieve this goal. However, CAD models are inherently multimodal, comprising parametric sequences and corresponding rendered visual objects. Besides,the rendering process from parametric sequences to visual objects is many-to-one. Therefore, both sequential and visual signals are critical for effective training. In this work, we introduce CADFusion, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone and alternates between two training stages: the sequential learning (SL) stage and the visual feedback (VF) stage. In the SL stage, we train LLMs using ground-truth parametric sequences, enabling the generation of logically coherent parametric sequences. In the VF stage, we reward parametric sequences that render into visually preferred objects and penalize those that do not, allowing LLMs to learn how rendered visual objects are perceived and evaluated. These two stages alternate throughout the training, ensuring balanced learning and preserving benefits of both signals. Experiments demonstrate that CADFusion significantly improves performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention power state-of-the-art video generation, but suffer from prohibitive compute cost -- when generating just a 5-second 720P video, attention alone takes 800 out of 945 seconds of total inference time. This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being hardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the first efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving 58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over FlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading video DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s without quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further lowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench. We make our codebase public at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a technique aimed at enhancing the performance of a small student network without increasing its parameter size by transferring knowledge from a large, pre-trained teacher network. In the feature space, different local regions within an individual global feature map often encode distinct yet interdependent semantic information. However, previous methods mainly focus on transferring global feature knowledge, neglecting the decoupling of interdependent local regions within an individual global feature, which often results in suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose MSDCRD, a novel contrastive representation distillation approach that explicitly performs multi-scale decoupling within the feature space. MSDCRD employs a multi-scale sliding-window pooling approach within the feature space to capture representations at various granularities effectively. This, in conjunction with sample categorization, facilitates efficient multi-scale feature decoupling. When integrated with a novel and effective contrastive loss function, this forms the core of MSDCRD. Feature representations differ significantly across network architectures, and this divergence becomes more pronounced in heterogeneous models, rendering feature distillation particularly challenging. Despite this, our method not only achieves superior performance in homogeneous models but also enables efficient feature knowledge transfer across a variety of heterogeneous teacher-student pairs, highlighting its strong generalizability. Moreover, its plug-and-play and parameter-free nature enables flexible integration with different visual tasks. Extensive experiments on different visual benchmarks consistently confirm the superiority of our method in enhancing the performance of student models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of weakly supervised cross-view localization, where the goal is to estimate the pose of a ground camera relative to a satellite image with noisy ground truth annotations. A common approach to bridge the cross-view domain gap for pose estimation is Bird's-Eye View (BEV) synthesis. However, existing methods struggle with height ambiguity due to the lack of depth information in ground images and satellite height maps. Previous solutions either assume a flat ground plane or rely on complex models, such as cross-view transformers. We propose BevSplat, a novel method that resolves height ambiguity by using feature-based Gaussian primitives. Each pixel in the ground image is represented by a 3D Gaussian with semantic and spatial features, which are synthesized into a BEV feature map for relative pose estimation. Additionally, to address challenges with panoramic query images, we introduce an icosphere-based supervision strategy for the Gaussian primitives. We validate our method on the widely used KITTI and VIGOR datasets, which include both pinhole and panoramic query images. Experimental results show that BevSplat significantly improves localization accuracy over prior approaches.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often struggle to recognize novel concepts, as they rely on pre-trained knowledge and have limited ability to capture subtle visual details. Domain-specific knowledge gaps in training also make them prone to confusing visually similar, commonly misrepresented, or low-resource concepts. To help LMMs better align nuanced visual features with language, improving their ability to recognize and reason about novel or rare concepts, we propose a Contrastive visual Data Augmentation (CoDA) strategy. CoDA extracts key contrastive textual and visual features of target concepts against the known concepts they are misrecognized as, and then uses multimodal generative models to produce targeted synthetic data. Automatic filtering of extracted features and augmented images is implemented to guarantee their quality, as verified by human annotators. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of CoDA on low-resource concept and diverse scene recognition datasets including INaturalist and SUN. We additionally collect NovelSpecies, a benchmark dataset consisting of newly discovered animal species that are guaranteed to be unseen by LMMs. LLaVA-1.6 1-shot updating results on these three datasets show CoDA significantly improves SOTA visual data augmentation strategies by 12.3% (NovelSpecies), 5.1% (SUN), and 6.0% (iNat) absolute gains in accuracy.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) achieves robust speech recognition in noisy environments by combining auditory and visual information. However, recent Large Language Model (LLM) based AVSR systems incur high computational costs due to the high temporal resolution of audio-visual speech processed by LLMs. In this work, we introduce an efficient multimodal speech LLM framework that minimizes token length while preserving essential linguistic content. Our approach employs an early AV-fusion module for streamlined feature integration, an audio-visual speech Q-Former that dynamically allocates tokens based on input duration, and a refined query allocation strategy with a speech rate predictor to adjust token allocation according to speaking speed of each audio sample. Extensive experiments on the LRS3 dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a WER of 0.72% while using only 3.5 tokens per second. Moreover, our approach not only reduces token usage by 86% compared to the previous multimodal speech LLM framework, but also improves computational efficiency by reducing FLOPs by 35.7%.

Abstract: In Omnimatte, one aims to decompose a given video into semantically meaningful layers, including the background and individual objects along with their associated effects, such as shadows and reflections. Existing methods often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects, and composite those objects onto new videos. These are accomplished by adapting zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. To overcome this, we introduce temporal and spatial attention guidance modules that steer the diffusion process for accurate object removal and temporally consistent background reconstruction. We further show that self-attention maps capture information about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time performance with minimal frame runtime.

Abstract: In mixed reality applications, a realistic acoustic experience in spatial environments is as crucial as the visual experience for achieving true immersion. Despite recent advances in neural approaches for Room Impulse Response (RIR) estimation, most existing methods are limited to the single environment on which they are trained, lacking the ability to generalize to new rooms with different geometries and surface materials. We aim to develop a unified model capable of reconstructing the spatial acoustic experience of any environment with minimum additional measurements. To this end, we present xRIR, a framework for cross-room RIR prediction. The core of our generalizable approach lies in combining a geometric feature extractor, which captures spatial context from panorama depth images, with a RIR encoder that extracts detailed acoustic features from only a few reference RIR samples. To evaluate our method, we introduce ACOUSTICROOMS, a new dataset featuring high-fidelity simulation of over 300,000 RIRs from 260 rooms. Experiments show that our method strongly outperforms a series of baselines. Furthermore, we successfully perform sim-to-real transfer by evaluating our model on four real-world environments, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach and the realism of our dataset.

Abstract: The exponential increase in video content poses significant challenges in terms of efficient navigation, search, and retrieval, thus requiring advanced video summarization techniques. Existing video summarization methods, which heavily rely on visual features and temporal dynamics, often fail to capture the semantics of video content, resulting in incomplete or incoherent summaries. To tackle the challenge, we propose a new video summarization framework that leverages the capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs), expecting that the knowledge learned from massive data enables LLMs to evaluate video frames in a manner that better aligns with diverse semantics and human judgments, effectively addressing the inherent subjectivity in defining keyframes. Our method, dubbed LLM-based Video Summarization (LLMVS), translates video frames into a sequence of captions using a Muti-modal Large Language Model (M-LLM) and then assesses the importance of each frame using an LLM, based on the captions in its local context. These local importance scores are refined through a global attention mechanism in the entire context of video captions, ensuring that our summaries effectively reflect both the details and the overarching narrative. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing ones in standard benchmarks, highlighting the potential of LLMs in the processing of multimedia content.

Abstract: Determining the vanishing points (VPs) in a Manhattan world, as a fundamental task in many 3D vision applications, consists of jointly inferring the line-VP association and locating each VP. Existing methods are, however, either sub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of computing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation techniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a "soft" association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error, that allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations. This approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP problem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative solver (called GlobustVP), which independently searches for one VP and its associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After each independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three VPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that GlobustVP achieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness, and global optimality compared to previous works. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/WU-CVGL/GlobustVP.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of irrigation methods is crucial for sustainable agricultural practices and food systems. However, existing models that rely solely on spectral features from satellite imagery are ineffective due to the complexity of agricultural landscapes and limited training data, making this a challenging problem. We present Knowledge-Informed Irrigation Mapping (KIIM), a novel Swin-Transformer based approach that uses (i) a specialized projection matrix to encode crop to irrigation probability, (ii) a spatial attention map to identify agricultural lands from non-agricultural lands, (iii) bi-directional cross-attention to focus complementary information from different modalities, and (iv) a weighted ensemble for combining predictions from images and crop information. Our experimentation on five states in the US shows up to 22.9\% (IoU) improvement over baseline with a 71.4% (IoU) improvement for hard-to-classify drip irrigation. In addition, we propose a two-phase transfer learning approach to enhance cross-state irrigation mapping, achieving a 51% IoU boost in a state with limited labeled data. The ability to achieve baseline performance with only 40% of the training data highlights its efficiency, reducing the dependency on extensive manual labeling efforts and making large-scale, automated irrigation mapping more feasible and cost-effective.

Abstract: Vectorized HD map is essential for autonomous driving. Remarkable work has been achieved in recent years, but there are still major issues: (1) in the generation of the BEV features, single modality-based methods are of limited perception capability, while direct concatenation-based multi-modal methods fail to capture synergies and disparities between different modalities, resulting in limited ranges with feature holes; (2) in the classification and localization of map elements, only point information is used without the consideration of element infor-mation and neglects the interaction between point information and element information, leading to erroneous shapes and element entanglement with low accuracy. To address above issues, we introduce SuperMapNet for long-range and high-accuracy vectorized HD map construction. It uses both camera images and LiDAR point clouds as input, and first tightly couple semantic information from camera images and geometric information from LiDAR point clouds by a cross-attention based synergy enhancement module and a flow-based disparity alignment module for long-range BEV feature generation. And then, local features from point queries and global features from element queries are tightly coupled by three-level interactions for high-accuracy classification and localization, where Point2Point interaction learns local geometric information between points of the same element and of each point, Element2Element interaction learns relation constraints between different elements and semantic information of each elements, and Point2Element interaction learns complement element information for its constituent points. Experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate superior performances, surpassing SOTAs over 14.9/8.8 mAP and 18.5/3.1 mAP under hard/easy settings, respectively. The code is made publicly available1.

Abstract: Place recognition is a cornerstone of vehicle navigation and mapping, which is pivotal in enabling systems to determine whether a location has been previously visited. This capability is critical for tasks such as loop closure in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and long-term navigation under varying environmental conditions. In this survey, we comprehensively review recent advancements in place recognition, emphasizing three representative methodological paradigms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches, Transformer-based frameworks, and cross-modal strategies. We begin by elucidating the significance of place recognition within the broader context of autonomous systems. Subsequently, we trace the evolution of CNN-based methods, highlighting their contributions to robust visual descriptor learning and scalability in large-scale environments. We then examine the emerging class of Transformer-based models, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies and offer improved generalization across diverse scenes. Furthermore, we discuss cross-modal approaches that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as Lidar, vision, and text description, thereby enhancing resilience to viewpoint, illumination, and seasonal variations. We also summarize standard datasets and evaluation metrics widely adopted in the literature. Finally, we identify current research challenges and outline prospective directions, including domain adaptation, real-time performance, and lifelong learning, to inspire future advancements in this domain. The unified framework of leading-edge place recognition methods, i.e., code library, and the results of their experimental evaluations are available at https://github.com/CV4RA/SOTA-Place-Recognitioner.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration; and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x speed-up in the prefilling stage.

Abstract: The global challenge of sustainable recycling demands automated, fast, and accurate, state-of-the-art (SOTA) material detection systems that act as a bedrock for a circular economy. Democratizing access to these cutting-edge solutions that enable real-time waste analysis is essential for scaling up recycling efforts and fostering the Green Deal. In response, we introduce \textbf{Electrolyzers-HSI}, a novel multimodal benchmark dataset designed to accelerate the recovery of critical raw materials through accurate electrolyzer materials classification. The dataset comprises 55 co-registered high-resolution RGB images and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data cubes spanning the 400--2500 nm spectral range, yielding over 4.2 million pixel vectors and 424,169 labeled ones. This enables non-invasive spectral analysis of shredded electrolyzer samples, supporting quantitative and qualitative material classification and spectral properties investigation. We evaluate a suite of baseline machine learning (ML) methods alongside SOTA transformer-based deep learning (DL) architectures, including Vision Transformer, SpectralFormer, and the Multimodal Fusion Transformer, to investigate architectural bottlenecks for further efficiency optimisation when deploying transformers in material identification. We implement zero-shot detection techniques and majority voting across pixel-level predictions to establish object-level classification robustness. In adherence to the FAIR data principles, the electrolyzers-HSI dataset and accompanying codebase are openly available at https://github.com/hifexplo/Electrolyzers-HSI and https://rodare.hzdr.de/record/3668, supporting reproducible research and facilitating the broader adoption of smart and sustainable e-waste recycling solutions.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating high-fidelity visual content. In this work, we explore how generative models can further be used not only to synthesize visual content but also to understand the properties of a scene given a natural image. We formulate scene understanding as an inverse generative modeling problem, where we seek to find conditional parameters of a visual generative model to best fit a given natural image. To enable this procedure to infer scene structure from images substantially different than those seen during training, we further propose to build this visual generative model compositionally from smaller models over pieces of a scene. We illustrate how this procedure enables us to infer the set of objects in a scene, enabling robust generalization to new test scenes with an increased number of objects of new shapes. We further illustrate how this enables us to infer global scene factors, likewise enabling robust generalization to new scenes. Finally, we illustrate how this approach can be directly applied to existing pretrained text-to-image generative models for zero-shot multi-object perception.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) has garnered significant attention in information retrieval. Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method. Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual enhancement without additional annotations. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over several state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: Modern diffusion MRI sequences commonly acquire a large number of volumes with diffusion sensitization gradients of differing strengths or directions. Such sequences rely on echo-planar imaging (EPI) to achieve reasonable scan duration. However, EPI is vulnerable to off-resonance effects, leading to tissue susceptibility and eddy-current induced distortions. The latter is particularly problematic because it causes misalignment between volumes, disrupting downstream modelling and analysis. The essential correction of eddy distortions is typically done post-acquisition, with image registration. However, this is non-trivial because correspondence between volumes can be severely disrupted due to volume-specific signal attenuations induced by varying directions and strengths of the applied gradients. This challenge has been successfully addressed by the popular FSL~Eddy tool but at considerable computational cost. We propose an alternative approach, leveraging recent advances in image processing enabled by deep learning (DL). It consists of two convolutional neural networks: 1) An image translator to restore correspondence between images; 2) A registration model to align the translated images. Results demonstrate comparable distortion estimates to FSL~Eddy, while requiring only modest training sample sizes. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to tackle this problem with deep learning. Together with recently developed DL-based susceptibility correction techniques, they pave the way for real-time preprocessing of diffusion MRI, facilitating its wider uptake in the clinic.

Abstract: Fetal brain tissue segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial tool that supports understanding of neurodevelopment, yet it faces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data coming from different scanners and settings, as well as data scarcity. Recent approaches based on domain randomization, like SynthSeg, have shown great potential for single-source domain generalization by simulating images with randomized contrast and image resolution from the label maps. In this work, we investigate how to maximize the out-of-domain (OOD) generalization potential of SynthSegbased methods in fetal brain MRI. Specifically, we demonstrate that the simple Gaussian mixture models employed in FetalSynthSeg outperform physics-informed generation methods in terms of OOD generalization. We further show that incorporating intensity clustering significantly enhances generalization in settings with limited label classes by producing more realistic synthetic data. By combining synthetic pretraining with fine-tuning on real images and applying weight-space interpolation between the two models, we propose DRIFTS as an effective and practical solution for single-source domain generalization. DRIFTS consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks and is, to our knowledge, the first method to achieve accurate brain tissue segmentation on fetal T1-weighted images. We validate our approach on 308 subjects from four datasets acquired at three different sites, covering a range of scanner field strengths (0.55T to 3T) and both T1w and T2w modalities. We conclude with five practical recommendations to guide the development of SynthSeg-based methods for other organs and imaging modalities.

Abstract: Machine learning models often rely on simple spurious features -- patterns in training data that correlate with targets but are not causally related to them, like image backgrounds in foreground classification. This reliance typically leads to imbalanced test performance across minority and majority groups. In this work, we take a closer look at the fundamental cause of such imbalanced performance through the lens of memorization, which refers to the ability to predict accurately on atypical examples (minority groups) in the training set but failing in achieving the same accuracy in the testing set. This paper systematically shows the ubiquitous existence of spurious features in a small set of neurons within the network, providing the first-ever evidence that memorization may contribute to imbalanced group performance. Through three experimental sources of converging empirical evidence, we find the property of a small subset of neurons or channels in memorizing minority group information. Inspired by these findings, we hypothesize that spurious memorization, concentrated within a small subset of neurons, plays a key role in driving imbalanced group performance. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we show that eliminating these unnecessary spurious memorization patterns via a novel framework during training can significantly affect the model performance on minority groups. Our experimental results across various architectures and benchmarks offer new insights on how neural networks encode core and spurious knowledge, laying the groundwork for future research in demystifying robustness to spurious correlation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by handling diverse inputs such as images, audio, and video, but at the cost of adding a multimodal encoding stage that increases both computational and memory overhead. This step negatively affects key Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as time to first token (TTFT) and time per output token (TPOT). We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our approach decouples these steps, unlocking new opportunities and optimizations. These include a mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a novel way to parallelize the encoding load within a request, a module for optimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel role-switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15x lower peak memory utilization), batch sizes (up to 22x larger), 10x more images per request, and 2.2x larger KV caches. Furthermore, it leads to significant improvements in SLO attainment (up to 90-100% improvement) and TTFT (up to 71% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate.

Abstract: Leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create embodied agents offers a promising avenue for tackling real-world tasks. While language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention, MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmbodiedBench, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate vision-driven embodied agents. EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 24 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9\% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied agents.

Abstract: Generating motion for arbitrary skeletons is a longstanding challenge in computer graphics, remaining largely unexplored due to the scarcity of diverse datasets and the irregular nature of the data. In this work, we introduce AnyTop, a diffusion model that generates motions for diverse characters with distinct motion dynamics, using only their skeletal structure as input. Our work features a transformer-based denoising network, tailored for arbitrary skeleton learning, integrating topology information into the traditional attention mechanism. Additionally, by incorporating textual joint descriptions into the latent feature representation, AnyTop learns semantic correspondences between joints across diverse skeletons. Our evaluation demonstrates that AnyTop generalizes well, even with as few as three training examples per topology, and can produce motions for unseen skeletons as well. Furthermore, our model's latent space is highly informative, enabling downstream tasks such as joint correspondence, temporal segmentation and motion editing. Our webpage, https://anytop2025.github.io/Anytop-page, includes links to videos and code.

Abstract: This paper advances motion agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) toward autonomous navigation in dynamic and cluttered environments, significantly surpassing first and recent seminal but limited studies on LLM's spatial reasoning, where movements are restricted in four directions in simple, static environments in the presence of only single agents much less multiple agents. Specifically, we investigate LLMs as spatial reasoners to overcome these limitations by uniformly encoding environments (e.g., real indoor floorplans), agents which can be dynamic obstacles and their paths as discrete tokens akin to language tokens. Our training-free framework supports multi-agent coordination, closed-loop replanning, and dynamic obstacle avoidance without retraining or fine-tuning. We show that LLMs can generalize across agents, tasks, and environments using only text-based interactions, opening new possibilities for semantically grounded, interactive navigation in both simulation and embodied systems.

Abstract: Poisson Surface Reconstruction is a widely-used algorithm for reconstructing a surface from an oriented point cloud. To facilitate applications where only partial surface information is available, or scanning is performed sequentially, a recent line of work proposes to incorporate uncertainty into the reconstructed surface via Gaussian process models. The resulting algorithms first perform Gaussian process interpolation, then solve a set of volumetric partial differential equations globally in space, resulting in a computationally expensive two-stage procedure. In this work, we apply recently-developed techniques from geometric Gaussian processes to combine interpolation and surface reconstruction into a single stage, requiring only one linear solve per sample. The resulting reconstructed surface samples can be queried locally in space, without the use of problem-dependent volumetric meshes or grids. These capabilities enable one to (a) perform probabilistic collision detection locally around the region of interest, (b) perform ray casting without evaluating points not on the ray's trajectory, and (c) perform next-view planning on a per-ray basis. They also do not requiring one to approximate kernel matrix inverses with diagonal matrices as part of intermediate computations, unlike prior methods. Results show that our approach provides a cleaner, more-principled, and more-flexible stochastic surface reconstruction pipeline.

Abstract: Realistic digital garment modeling remains a labor-intensive task due to the intricate process of translating 2D sewing patterns into high-fidelity, simulation-ready 3D garments. We introduce GarmageNet, a unified generative framework that automates the creation of 2D sewing patterns, the construction of sewing relationships, and the synthesis of 3D garment initializations compatible with physics-based simulation. Central to our approach is Garmage, a novel garment representation that encodes each panel as a structured geometry image, effectively bridging the semantic and geometric gap between 2D structural patterns and 3D garment shapes. GarmageNet employs a latent diffusion transformer to synthesize panel-wise geometry images and integrates GarmageJigsaw, a neural module for predicting point-to-point sewing connections along panel contours. To support training and evaluation, we build GarmageSet, a large-scale dataset comprising over 10,000 professionally designed garments with detailed structural and style annotations. Our method demonstrates versatility and efficacy across multiple application scenarios, including scalable garment generation from multi-modal design concepts (text prompts, sketches, photographs), automatic modeling from raw flat sewing patterns, pattern recovery from unstructured point clouds, and progressive garment editing using conventional instructions-laying the foundation for fully automated, production-ready pipelines in digital fashion.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pose unique safety challenges due to their integration of visual and textual data, thereby introducing new dimensions of potential attacks and complex risk combinations. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM} (\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety \textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Experimental results show that DREAM significantly boosts safety during both inference and training phases without compromising performance on normal tasks (namely oversafety), achieving a 16.17\% improvement in the SIUO safe\&amp;effective score compared to GPT-4V.

<title>MM-PRM: Enhancing Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning with Scalable Step-Level Supervision</title>

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language understanding, they still struggle with complex multi-step reasoning, often producing logically inconsistent or partially correct solutions. A key limitation lies in the lack of fine-grained supervision over intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we propose MM-PRM, a process reward model trained within a fully automated, scalable framework. We first build MM-Policy, a strong multimodal model trained on diverse mathematical reasoning data. Then, we construct MM-K12, a curated dataset of 10,000 multimodal math problems with verifiable answers, which serves as seed data. Leveraging a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based pipeline, we generate over 700k step-level annotations without human labeling. The resulting PRM is used to score candidate reasoning paths in the Best-of-N inference setup and achieves significant improvements across both in-domain (MM-K12 test set) and out-of-domain (OlympiadBench, MathVista, etc.) benchmarks. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of soft labels, smaller learning rates, and path diversity in optimizing PRM performance. MM-PRM demonstrates that process supervision is a powerful tool for enhancing the logical robustness of multimodal reasoning systems. We release all our codes and data at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-PRM.

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), benefiting from large language models, is an emerging interactive AI system that simulates roles or characters with diverse personalities. However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/OmniCharacter.

Abstract: Group synchronization is the problem of determining reliable global estimates from noisy local measurements on networks. The typical task for group synchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a way that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information about local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on a hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the hyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group synchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image processing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of higher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations. Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions which establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group synchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general higher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on higher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm. We discuss theoretical guarantees for our framework, including convergence analyses under outliers and noise. Finally, we show potential advantages of our method through numerical experiments. In particular, we show that in certain cases our higher-order method applied to rotational and angular synchronization outperforms standard pairwise synchronization methods and is more robust to outliers. We also show that our method has comparable performance on simulated cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data compared to a standard cryo-EM reconstruction package.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D robotic manipulation have improved grasping of everyday objects, but transparent and specular materials remain challenging due to depth sensing limitations. While several 3D reconstruction and depth completion approaches address these challenges, they suffer from setup complexity or limited observation information utilization. To address this, leveraging the power of single view 3D object reconstruction approaches, we propose a training free framework SR3D that enables robotic grasping of transparent and specular objects from a single view observation. Specifically, given single view RGB and depth images, SR3D first uses the external visual models to generate 3D reconstructed object mesh based on RGB image. Then, the key idea is to determine the 3D object's pose and scale to accurately localize the reconstructed object back into its original depth corrupted 3D scene. Therefore, we propose view matching and keypoint matching mechanisms,which leverage both the 2D and 3D's inherent semantic and geometric information in the observation to determine the object's 3D state within the scene, thereby reconstructing an accurate 3D depth map for effective grasp detection. Experiments in both simulation and real world show the reconstruction effectiveness of SR3D.

<title>Contrast-Invariant Self-supervised Segmentation for Quantitative Placental MRI</title>

Abstract: Accurate placental segmentation is essential for quantitative analysis of the placenta. However, this task is particularly challenging in T2*-weighted placental imaging due to: (1) weak and inconsistent boundary contrast across individual echoes; (2) the absence of manual ground truth annotations for all echo times; and (3) motion artifacts across echoes caused by fetal and maternal movement. In this work, we propose a contrast-augmented segmentation framework that leverages complementary information across multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI to learn robust, contrast-invariant representations. Our method integrates: (i) masked autoencoding (MAE) for self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled multi-echo slices; (ii) masked pseudo-labeling (MPL) for unsupervised domain adaptation across echo times; and (iii) global-local collaboration to align fine-grained features with global anatomical context. We further introduce a semantic matching loss to encourage representation consistency across echoes of the same subject. Experiments on a clinical multi-echo placental MRI dataset demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively across echo times and outperforms both single-echo and naive fusion baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically exploit multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI for placental segmentation.

<div> Keywords: motion control, video generation, trajectory-based inputs, generative process, controllability <br />
Summary: 
This study proposes a unified framework for motion control in video generation by integrating camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. Unlike previous methods that handle these motion types separately, this approach combines user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models through a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or a mix of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to create temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. The framework shows superior performance in various video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects, dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments demonstrate better controllability and visual quality compared to existing methods and commercial solutions. The approach remains compatible with different state-of-the-art video generation backbones. <div>

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

Summary:<br />
This paper discusses the potential of CLIP, a model trained for aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, for image synthesis without the need for a decoder or fine-tuning. The approach focuses on optimizing an implicit neural representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying frequencies across network layers. Several techniques are introduced to stabilize the inverse mapping process, including adversarially robust initialization, Orthogonal Procrustes projection, and a blending loss. These methods enable capabilities such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and image reconstruction without modifying the weights of CLIP. The study suggests that discriminative models like CLIP may have untapped generative potential, opening up new possibilities for image synthesis applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain sight.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Graph Flow Matching (GFM) as an enhancement to existing flow matching networks for sample generation tasks. GFM incorporates neighbor information through a diffusion term in addition to the standard reaction term, improving velocity predictions and enhancing generation quality. By leveraging a graph neural module, GFM effectively captures correlations between points along the generation trajectory, leading to improved Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and recall in image generation benchmarks. Operating within the latent space of a pretrained variational autoencoder, GFM offers a lightweight solution that enhances existing flow models with minimal additional computational cost. Overall, GFM demonstrates its effectiveness as a modular enhancement to deep flow architectures for improved sample generation outcomes. <br />  <div>

Abstract: Flow matching casts sample generation as learning a continuous-time velocity field that transports noise to data. Existing flow matching networks typically predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its effectiveness as a modular enhancement to existing flow matching architectures.

Abstract: Amid the challenges posed by global population growth and climate change, traditional agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) systems is currently undergoing a significant digital transformation to facilitate efficient big data processing. While smart agriculture utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enable precise control, it still encounters significant challenges, including excessive reliance on agricultural expert knowledge, difficulties in fusing multimodal data, poor adaptability to dynamic environments, and bottlenecks in real-time decision-making at the edge. Large language models (LLMs), with their exceptional capabilities in knowledge acquisition and semantic understanding, provide a promising solution to address these challenges. To this end, we propose Farm-LightSeek, an edge-centric multimodal agricultural IoT data analytics framework that integrates LLMs with edge computing. This framework collects real-time farmland multi-source data (images, weather, geographic information) via sensors, performs cross-modal reasoning and disease detection at edge nodes, conducts low-latency management decisions, and enables cloud collaboration for model updates. The main innovations of Farm-LightSeek include: (1) an agricultural "perception-decision-action" closed-loop architecture; (2) cross-modal adaptive monitoring; and (3)a lightweight LLM deployment strategy balancing performance and efficiency. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Farm-LightSeek consistently achieves reliable performance in mission-critical tasks, even under the limitations of edge computing resources. This work advances intelligent real-time agricultural solutions and highlights the potential for deeper integration of agricultural IoT with LLMs.

Abstract: Human beings rely heavily on estimation of poses in order to access their body movements. Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision advances in order to track human body movements in real life applications. This comes from videos which are recorded through available devices. These para-digms provide potential to make human movement measurement more accessible to users. The consumers of pose estimation movements believe that human poses content tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation software usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we develop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human health. This proposed hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method aims to detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified real time pose estimation. This ensemble allows fusion of performance of stated methods in real time. The input poses from images are fed into individual meth-ods. The pose transformation method helps to identify relevant features for en-semble to perform training effectively. After this, customized pre-trained hybrid ensemble is trained on public benchmarked datasets which is being evaluated through test datasets. The effectiveness and viability of proposed method is estab-lished based on comparative analysis of group pose estimation methods and ex-periments conducted on benchmarked datasets. It provides best optimized results in real-time pose estimation. It makes pose estimation method more robust to oc-clusion and improves dense regression accuracy. These results have affirmed po-tential application of this method in several real-time situations with improvement in human health life span

Summary:<br />
This study addresses the risk of misusing text-to-image generative models for malicious purposes by proposing a method to incorporate neural fingerprinting. Existing methods have not achieved 100% attribution accuracy, making them impractical for deployment. The proposed approach leverages cyclic error correcting codes from coding theory to improve accuracy. By combining neural fingerprinting with text-to-image diffusion models, the study aims to strike a balance between attribution accuracy and generation quality. The open-source nature of generative models underscores the need for robust risk mitigation strategies. The use of coding theory concepts adds a novel dimension to the field of neural fingerprinting for text-to-image models. The research contributes to the ongoing efforts to combat misuse of AI technologies for malicious intents.<br /> <div>

Abstract: The risk of misusing text-to-image generative models for malicious uses, especially due to the open-source development of such models, has become a serious concern. As a risk mitigation strategy, attributing generative models with neural fingerprinting is emerging as a popular technique. There has been a plethora of recent work that aim for addressing neural fingerprinting. A trade-off between the attribution accuracy and generation quality of such models has been studied extensively. None of the existing methods yet achieved $100\%$ attribution accuracy. However, any model with less than \emph{perfect} accuracy is practically non-deployable. In this work, we propose an accurate method to incorporate neural fingerprinting for text-to-image diffusion models leveraging the concepts of cyclic error correcting codes from the literature of coding theory.

Abstract: EdgeVidSum is a lightweight method that generates personalized, fast-forward summaries of long-form videos directly on edge devices. The proposed approach enables real-time video summarization while safeguarding user privacy through local data processing using innovative thumbnail-based techniques and efficient neural architectures. Unlike conventional methods that process entire videos frame by frame, the proposed method uses thumbnail containers to significantly reduce computational complexity without sacrificing semantic relevance. The framework employs a hierarchical analysis approach, where a lightweight 2D CNN model identifies user-preferred content from thumbnails and generates timestamps to create fast-forward summaries. Our interactive demo highlights the system's ability to create tailored video summaries for long-form videos, such as movies, sports events, and TV shows, based on individual user preferences. The entire computation occurs seamlessly on resource-constrained devices like Jetson Nano, demonstrating how EdgeVidSum addresses the critical challenges of computational efficiency, personalization, and privacy in modern video consumption environments.

Abstract: Physical intelligence -- anticipating and shaping the world from partial, multisensory observations -- is critical for next-generation world models. We propose FOLIAGE, a physics-informed multimodal world model for unbounded accretive surface growth. In its Action-Perception loop, a unified context encoder maps images, mesh connectivity, and point clouds to a shared latent state. A physics-aware predictor, conditioned on physical control actions, advances this latent state in time to align with the target latent of the surface, yielding a Modality-Agnostic Growth Embedding (MAGE) that interfaces with critic heads for downstream objectives. FOLIAGE's Accretive Graph Network (AGN) captures dynamic connectivity through Age Positional Encoding and Energy-Gated Message-Passing. Geometry-Correspondence Fusion and Cross-Patch Masking enhance MAGE's expressiveness, while Hierarchical Pooling balances global context with local dynamics. We create SURF-GARDEN, a world model learning platform comprising a Counterfactual Physics Simulator, a Multimodal Correspondence Extractor, and Evolution Tracing, which generates 7,200 diverse surface-growth sequences. SURF-BENCH, our physical-intelligence evaluation suite, evaluates six core tasks -- topology recognition, inverse material estimation, growth-stage classification, latent roll-out, cross-modal retrieval, and dense correspondence -- and four stress tests -- sensor dropout, zero-shot modality transfer, long-horizon prediction, and physics ablation -- to probe resilience. FOLIAGE outperforms specialized baselines while remaining robust across dynamic environments, establishing a new world-model based, multimodal pathway to physical intelligence.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces AURA-MFM, a multimodal foundation model that integrates third-person video, motion capture, IMU, and text data for detailed human activity analysis. By combining these modalities, the model offers a comprehensive understanding of human behavior that surpasses existing methods. A Transformer-based IMU encoder further enhances the model's performance. Experimental results show superior performance in retrieval and activity recognition tasks compared to current approaches. In zero-shot classification for action recognition, the model achieved higher F1-score and accuracy, outperforming existing methods significantly. AURA-MFM addresses the limitations of previous models by providing a multidimensional perspective on human activity, making it a promising advancement in behavior analysis using wearable devices. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the widespread adoption of wearable devices has highlighted the growing importance of behavior analysis using IMU. While applications span diverse fields such as healthcare and robotics, recent studies have increasingly focused on multimodal analysis, in addition to unimodal analysis. Several studies have proposed multimodal foundation models that incorporate first-person video and text data; however, these models still fall short in providing a detailed analysis of full-body human activity. To address this limitation, we propose Activity Understanding and Representations Alignment - Multimodal Foundation Model (AURA-MFM), a foundational model integrating four modalities: third-person video, motion capture, IMU, and text. By incorporating third-person video and motion capture data, the model enables a detailed and multidimensional understanding of human activity, which first-person perspectives alone fail to capture. Additionally, a Transformer-based IMU encoder is employed to enhance the model's overall performance. Experimental evaluations on retrieval and activity recognition tasks demonstrate that our model surpasses existing methods. Notably, in the zero-shot classification for action recognition, our method achieved significantly higher performance, with an F1-score of 0.6226 and an accuracy of 0.7320, whereas the existing method recorded an F1-score of 0.0747 and an accuracy of 0.1961.

<div> privacy concerns, multimodal large language models, video understanding applications, membership inference attacks, Sharma-Mittal entropy<br />
Summary:<br />
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are being increasingly used in video understanding applications, raising concerns about privacy due to the inclusion of sensitive video content in their training datasets. Existing methods for membership inference attacks (MIAs) in MLLMs are not effective for video data due to scalability and temporal variations. A new method, Vid-SME, tailored for video understanding LLMs (VULLMs), is introduced to address these challenges. Vid-SME computes Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME) for video inputs, leveraging the confidence of model outputs and adapting parameters for improved accuracy. By comparing SME differences between natural and temporally-reversed video frames, Vid-SME provides robust membership scores to identify videos in a model's training set. Experimental results on various VULLMs show that Vid-SME is highly effective in determining improperly used videos during training. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in handling complex multimodal tasks and are increasingly adopted in video understanding applications. However, their rapid advancement raises serious data privacy concerns, particularly given the potential inclusion of sensitive video content, such as personal recordings and surveillance footage, in their training datasets. Determining improperly used videos during training remains a critical and unresolved challenge. Despite considerable progress on membership inference attacks (MIAs) for text and image data in MLLMs, existing methods fail to generalize effectively to the video domain. These methods suffer from poor scalability as more frames are sampled and generally achieve negligible true positive rates at low false positive rates (TPR@Low FPR), mainly due to their failure to capture the inherent temporal variations of video frames and to account for model behavior differences as the number of frames varies. To address these challenges, we introduce Vid-SME, the first membership inference method tailored for video data used in video understanding LLMs (VULLMs). Vid-SME leverages the confidence of model output and integrates adaptive parameterization to compute Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME) for video inputs. By leveraging the SME difference between natural and temporally-reversed video frames, Vid-SME derives robust membership scores to determine whether a given video is part of the model's training set. Experiments on various self-trained and open-sourced VULLMs demonstrate the strong effectiveness of Vid-SME.

Summary: 
The article introduces TerraIncognita, a benchmark designed to assess multimodal models' ability to identify unknown insect species from image data. The dataset combines images of known and rare species from underexplored biodiversity hotspots. Models are evaluated on hierarchical taxonomic classification, detection of novel species, and generation of taxonomically aligned explanations. Top models show high proficiency at the Order level but struggle at the Species level, indicating the difficulty of fine taxonomic prediction. TerraIncognita will be regularly updated with new species, providing a platform for long-term benchmarking. The dataset, results, and future updates are available online. <div>

Abstract: The rapid global loss of biodiversity, particularly among insects, represents an urgent ecological crisis. Current methods for insect species discovery are manual, slow, and severely constrained by taxonomic expertise, hindering timely conservation actions. We introduce TerraIncognita, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal models for the challenging problem of identifying unknown, potentially undescribed insect species from image data. Our benchmark dataset combines a mix of expertly annotated images of insect species likely known to frontier AI models, and images of rare and poorly known species, for which few/no publicly available images exist. These images were collected from underexplored biodiversity hotspots, realistically mimicking open-world discovery scenarios faced by ecologists. The benchmark assesses models' proficiency in hierarchical taxonomic classification, their capability to detect and abstain from out-of-distribution (OOD) samples representing novel species, and their ability to generate explanations aligned with expert taxonomic knowledge. Notably, top-performing models achieve over 90\% F1 at the Order level on known species, but drop below 2\% at the Species level, highlighting the sharp difficulty gradient from coarse to fine taxonomic prediction (Order $\rightarrow$ Family $\rightarrow$ Genus $\rightarrow$ Species). TerraIncognita will be updated regularly, and by committing to quarterly dataset expansions (of both known and novel species), will provide an evolving platform for longitudinal benchmarking of frontier AI methods. All TerraIncognita data, results, and future updates are available \href{https://baskargroup.github.io/TerraIncognita/}{here}.

<div> Keywords: Continual learning, model merging, stability, plasticity, vision-language models

Summary:
Continual learning is typically approached through sequential fine-tuning, leading to a bias towards recent tasks at the expense of retaining prior knowledge. In this study, the authors introduce a new method based on model merging to balance stability and plasticity. Rather than solely updating model weights sequentially, they propose merging newly trained task parameters with previously learned ones to achieve a better equilibrium. They also suggest a mechanism to promote learning aligned weights with existing ones to prevent interference during the merging process. Evaluation on large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrates that this approach reduces forgetting, enhances robustness to different task orders and similarities, and boosts generalization capabilities. The findings suggest that model merging can effectively address the challenges of continual learning by maintaining stability while still allowing for adaptation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning is conventionally tackled through sequential fine-tuning, a process that, while enabling adaptation, inherently favors plasticity over the stability needed to retain prior knowledge. While existing approaches attempt to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, a bias towards recent tasks persists as they build upon this sequential nature. In this work we present a new perspective based on model merging to maintain stability while still retaining plasticity. Rather than just sequentially updating the model weights, we propose merging newly trained task parameters with previously learned ones, promoting a better balance. To maximize the effectiveness of the merging process, we propose a simple mechanism that promotes learning aligned weights with previous ones, thereby avoiding interference when merging. We evaluate this approach on large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing forgetting, increasing robustness to various task orders and similarities, and improving generalization.

Summary: <br />
Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLMs) face challenges in generalization ability under test-time distribution shifts. Existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are limited in leveraging internal knowledge for dynamic adaptation of complex visual semantic information. To address this, Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning (MINT) is proposed, introducing a Memory Prompt Bank (MPB) to store key-value prompt pairs as memory of seen samples. At test time, relevant pairs are retrieved to create Associative Prompts for adaptive visual guidance. MINT utilizes learnable text prompts for rapid VLM adaptation without retraining. The framework allows precise customization of visual contextual guidance by dynamically assembling associative prompts leveraging stored memory. <div>

Abstract: Improving the generalization ability of Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLMs) under test-time data distribution shifts remains a critical challenge. The existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods fall short in fully leveraging the model's internal knowledge, particularly in dynamically adapting to complex and hierarchical visual semantic information. In this paper, we propose Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning (MINT), a novel framework to address this issue. Inspired by human associative memory theory, MINT introduces a Memory Prompt Bank (MPB), which stores learnable key-value prompt pairs that work as a memory of previously seen samples. During the test time, relevant prompt pairs in the MPB are retrieved by the hierarchical visual features of test images to dynamically assemble Associative Prompts. The associative prompts are then injected into the image encoder for fine-grained, customized visual contextual guidance. MINT also utilizes learnable text prompts. MINT thus enables rapid, precise VLM adaptation at test time by leveraging this MPB-acquired memory, without source data or retraining. The code is available at https://github.com/Jamieyi2004/MINT.

Summary: 
- Unintentional falls are a major health concern for seniors, necessitating the need for an automated fall detection system.
- The proposed system uses a pre-trained 3D CNN model to extract both spatial and temporal features, reducing training time.
- A SVM classifier is then trained to classify activities as either falls or ADL using stratified shuffle five split cross-validation.
- The model utilizes the Sports1M dataset for pre-training and is tested on the GMDCSA and CAUCAFall datasets.
- The source code for the system is available at https://github.com/ekramalam/HFD_3DCNN. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Unintentional or accidental falls are one of the significant health issues in senior persons. The population of senior persons is increasing steadily. So, there is a need for an automated fall detection monitoring system. This paper introduces a vision-based fall detection system using a pre-trained 3D CNN. Unlike 2D CNN, 3D CNN extracts not only spatial but also temporal features. The proposed model leverages the original learned weights of a 3D CNN model pre-trained on the Sports1M dataset to extract the spatio-temporal features. Only the SVM classifier was trained, which saves the time required to train the 3D CNN. Stratified shuffle five split cross-validation has been used to split the dataset into training and testing data. Extracted features from the proposed 3D CNN model were fed to an SVM classifier to classify the activity as fall or ADL. Two datasets, GMDCSA and CAUCAFall, were utilized to conduct the experiment.

Summary: 
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are proficient in high-level visual reasoning but struggle with nuanced perceptual tasks, as revealed by the new benchmark HueManity. The dataset consists of images with alphanumeric strings embedded in challenging dot patterns, testing precise pattern recognition abilities. When compared to human and traditional computer vision benchmarks, MLLMs exhibited a notable performance deficit, achieving only 33.6% accuracy on the numeric task and a mere 3% on the alphanumeric task. In contrast, humans achieved nearly perfect scores, and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. The study also delves into architectural and training paradigm factors contributing to MLLMs' perceptual limitations. To encourage further research in enhancing MLLMs' perceptual robustness, the HueManity dataset and code have been made open-source. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

Summary:
AutoSEP is a novel iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework that aims to improve the fine-grained image classification capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in an unsupervised manner. By leveraging unlabeled data, AutoSEP learns a description prompt to guide MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within images, ultimately enhancing classification accuracy. The framework iteratively improves the prompt using instance-level classification scoring functions, without the need for training or fine-tuning. Evaluation on multiple fine-grained classification datasets shows that AutoSEP consistently outperforms other unsupervised baselines, with an average improvement of 13% over standard zero-shot classification and 5% over the best-performing baselines. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the self-supervised optimization framework in enhancing MLLM performance for fine-grained image classification tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing promising results on general zero-shot image classification tasks, fine-grained image classification remains challenging. It demands precise attention to subtle visual details to distinguish between visually similar subcategories--details that MLLMs may easily overlook without explicit guidance. To address this, we introduce AutoSEP, an iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework designed to enhance MLLM fine-grained classification capabilities in a fully unsupervised manner. Our core idea is to leverage unlabeled data to learn a description prompt that guides MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within an image, and boosts classification accuracy. We developed an automatic self-enhancing prompt learning framework called AutoSEP to iteratively improve the description prompt using unlabeled data, based on instance-level classification scoring function. AutoSEP only requires black-box access to MLLMs, eliminating the need for any training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach on multiple fine-grained classification datasets. It consistently outperforms other unsupervised baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our self-supervised optimization framework. Notably, AutoSEP on average improves 13 percent over standard zero-shot classification and 5 percent over the best-performing baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/yq-hong/AutoSEP

Abstract: Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.

To address the limitations of current AQA methodologies, the authors propose the FLEX dataset, the first multi-modal, multi-action dataset that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG) signals.

FLEX also utilizes knowledge graphs to construct annotation rules for mapping actions, keysteps, error types, and feedback. Baseline methodologies on FLEX show that multimodal data, multiview data, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance model performance. Overall, FLEX advances AQA methodologies and datasets towards multi-modal and multi-action scenarios, contributing to the integration of artificial intelligence in the fitness domain.

Abstract: With the increasing awareness of health and the growing desire for aesthetic physique, fitness has become a prevailing trend. However, the potential risks associated with fitness training, especially with weight-loaded fitness actions, cannot be overlooked. Action Quality Assessment (AQA), a technology that quantifies the quality of human action and provides feedback, holds the potential to assist fitness enthusiasts of varying skill levels in achieving better training outcomes. Nevertheless, current AQA methodologies and datasets are limited to single-view competitive sports scenarios and RGB modality and lack professional assessment and guidance of fitness actions. To address this gap, we propose the FLEX dataset, the first multi-modal, multi-action, large-scale dataset that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG) signals into AQA. FLEX utilizes high-precision MoCap to collect 20 different weight-loaded actions performed by 38 subjects across 3 different skill levels for 10 repetitions each, containing 5 different views of the RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological information. Additionally, FLEX incorporates knowledge graphs into AQA, constructing annotation rules in the form of penalty functions that map weight-loaded actions, action keysteps, error types, and feedback. We conducted various baseline methodologies on FLEX, demonstrating that multimodal data, multiview data, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance model performance. FLEX not only advances AQA methodologies and datasets towards multi-modal and multi-action scenarios but also fosters the integration of artificial intelligence within the fitness domain.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces GenSeC-PC, a novel channel-adaptive cross-modal generative semantic communication framework for efficient transmission of point clouds (PCs) in autonomous driving and extended reality applications. GenSeC-PC combines images and point clouds using a semantic encoder and PointDif decoder for high compression efficiency and superior reconstruction. A streamlined and asymmetric channel-adaptive joint semantic-channel coding architecture enables robust transmission with feedback on SNR and bandwidth for the encoder. The use of rectified denoising diffusion implicit models allows real-time PC communication. GenSeC-PC leverages generative priors for reliable reconstruction from noisy or incomplete source PCs and supports fully analog transmission, improving compression efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-modal semantic extraction and dual-metric guided fine-tuning, showcasing robustness in various conditions such as low SNR, bandwidth limitations, multiple 2D images, and new objects. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: With the rapid development of autonomous driving and extended reality, efficient transmission of point clouds (PCs) has become increasingly important. In this context, we propose a novel channel-adaptive cross-modal generative semantic communication (SemCom) for PC transmission, called GenSeC-PC. GenSeC-PC employs a semantic encoder that fuses images and point clouds, where images serve as non-transmitted side information. Meanwhile, the decoder is built upon the backbone of PointDif. Such a cross-modal design not only ensures high compression efficiency but also delivers superior reconstruction performance compared to PointDif. Moreover, to ensure robust transmission and reduce system complexity, we design a streamlined and asymmetric channel-adaptive joint semantic-channel coding architecture, where only the encoder needs the feedback of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and available bandwidth. In addition, rectified denoising diffusion implicit models is employed to accelerate the decoding process to the millisecond level, enabling real-time PC communication. Unlike existing methods, GenSeC-PC leverages generative priors to ensure reliable reconstruction even from noisy or incomplete source PCs. More importantly, it supports fully analog transmission, improving compression efficiency by eliminating the need for error-free side information transmission common in prior SemCom approaches. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of cross-modal semantic extraction and dual-metric guided fine-tuning, highlighting the framework's robustness across diverse conditions, including low SNR, bandwidth limitations, varying numbers of 2D images, and previously unseen objects.

Abstract: Plant Disease Detection (PDD) is a key aspect of precision agriculture. However, existing deep learning methods often rely on extensively annotated datasets, which are time-consuming and costly to generate. Self-supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by exploiting the abundance of unlabeled data. However, most existing SSL approaches suffer from high computational costs due to convolutional neural networks or transformer-based architectures. Additionally, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies in visual representation and rely on static loss functions that fail to align local and global features effectively. To address these challenges, we propose ConMamba, a novel SSL framework specially designed for PDD. ConMamba integrates the Vision Mamba Encoder (VME), which employs a bidirectional State Space Model (SSM) to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level contrastive loss with dynamic weight adjustment to optimize local-global feature alignment. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics. This provides an efficient and robust solution for PDD.

Abstract: Accurately estimating high-resolution carbon emissions is crucial for effective emission governance and mitigation planning. While conventional methods for precise carbon accounting are hindered by substantial data collection efforts, the rise of open data and advanced learning techniques offers a promising solution. Once an open data-based prediction model is developed and trained, it can easily infer emissions for new areas based on available open data. To address this, we incorporate two modalities of open data, satellite images and point-of-interest (POI) data, to predict high-resolution urban carbon emissions, with satellite images providing macroscopic and static and POI data offering fine-grained and relatively dynamic functionality information. However, estimating high-resolution carbon emissions presents two significant challenges: the intertwined and implicit effects of various functionalities on carbon emissions, and the complex spatial contiguity correlations that give rise to the agglomeration effect. Our model, OpenCarbon, features two major designs that target the challenges: a cross-modality information extraction and fusion module to extract complementary functionality information from two modules and model their interactions, and a neighborhood-informed aggregation module to capture the spatial contiguity correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's superiority, with a significant performance gain of 26.6\% on R2. Further generalizability tests and case studies also show OpenCarbon's capacity to capture the intrinsic relation between urban functionalities and carbon emissions, validating its potential to empower efficient carbon governance and targeted carbon mitigation planning.

<div> Keywords: Noisy partial label learning, Pre-trained vision-language models, Collaborative consistency regularization, Instance-dependent noise, Few-shot annotations<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a method for learning from noisy partial labels annotated by pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). The proposed collaborative consistency regularization (Co-Reg) method addresses the instance-dependent noise generated by pre-trained models, making learning more challenging. The approach involves training two neural networks simultaneously to purify training labels through a "Co-Pseudo-Labeling" mechanism and enforcing consistency regularization constraints in both label and feature representation spaces. The method can also utilize few-shot manually annotated valid labels for improved performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach compared to other denoising algorithms, annotation methods, and pre-trained model application schemes. The study highlights the potential of integrating weakly-supervised learning techniques into the knowledge distillation process of pre-trained models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of noisy partial label learning (NPLL), each training sample is associated with a set of candidate labels annotated by multiple noisy annotators. With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVa and GPT-4V, the direction of using these models to replace time-consuming manual annotation workflows and achieve "manual-annotation-free" training for downstream tasks has become a highly promising research avenue. This paper focuses on learning from noisy partial labels annotated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes an innovative collaborative consistency regularization (Co-Reg) method. Unlike the symmetric noise primarily addressed in traditional noisy label learning, the noise generated by pre-trained models is instance-dependent, embodying the underlying patterns of the pre-trained models themselves, which significantly increases the learning difficulty for the model. To address this, we simultaneously train two neural networks that implement collaborative purification of training labels through a "Co-Pseudo-Labeling" mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization constraints in both the label space and feature representation space. Our method can also leverage few-shot manually annotated valid labels to further enhance its performances. Comparative experiments with different denoising and disambiguation algorithms, annotation manners, and pre-trained model application schemes fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, while revealing the broad prospects of integrating weakly-supervised learning techniques into the knowledge distillation process of pre-trained models.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion Transformers, Dynamic Sparsity, Inference Speedup, Image Generation, Video Generation

Summary: 
Chipmunk introduces dynamic sparsity at inference time to reduce redundancy in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) without retraining. By analyzing activations in two state-of-the-art DiTs, Chipmunk identifies the fastest-changing intermediate activations and caches the rest. To address the challenges of sparse operations underutilizing GPU tensor cores and introduce overhead, Chipmunk utilizes column-wise sparsity and overlaps computation with other tasks. This approach results in a 9.3x speedup at 93% sparsity compared to dense baselines. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. When stacked on top of full step caching, Chipmunk achieves a 3.72x speedup on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while maintaining minimal quality impact.  <div>
arXiv:2506.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in high-quality image and video generation but incur substantial compute cost at inference. A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly across inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant across steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this redundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change between steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25% of the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations across steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic sparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate activations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems challenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU tensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and caching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges, Chipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce column-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient sparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at 93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk overlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other parts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra latency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that Chipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev with minimal quality impact.

<div> Keywords: optical flow estimation, neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, iterative refinements, improvement

Summary: 
Recent advancements in optical flow estimation have utilized neural networks to predict flow fields between images. Traditional approaches involve fixed-step iterations for refinement, potentially leading to suboptimal results. This paper introduces a novel method utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) to predict flow derivatives in a continuous model. This approach dynamically adjusts the number of compute steps based on input data, offering improved performance tailored to specific data characteristics. By employing a specific neural architecture and ODE solver, the proposed model can match the updates of existing recurrent cell methods, but with increased adaptability. Extensive experiments on optical flow benchmarks showcase significant enhancements over baseline and existing models, achieved with just a single refinement step. <div>
arXiv:2506.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works on optical flow estimation use neural networks to predict the flow field that maps positions of one image to positions of the other. These networks consist of a feature extractor, a correlation volume, and finally several refinement steps. These refinement steps mimic the iterative refinements performed by classical optimization algorithms and are usually implemented by neural layers (e.g., GRU) which are recurrently executed for a fixed and pre-determined number of steps. However, relying on a fixed number of steps may result in suboptimal performance because it is not tailored to the input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for predicting the derivative of the flow using a continuous model, namely neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). One key advantage of this approach is its capacity to model an equilibrium process, dynamically adjusting the number of compute steps based on the data at hand. By following a particular neural architecture, ODE solver, and associated hyperparameters, our proposed model can replicate the exact same updates as recurrent cells used in existing works, offering greater generality. Through extensive experimental analysis on optical flow benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive improvement over baseline and existing models, all while requiring only a single refinement step.

Summary:
SportMamba is a new adaptive hybrid multi-object tracking technique designed specifically for dynamic team sports. It introduces a mamba-attention mechanism to model non-linear motion patterns and a height-adaptive spatial association metric to handle ID switches caused by occlusions. The technique also includes adaptive buffers to improve associations in fast-motion scenarios. SportMamba demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the challenging SportsMOT dataset, known for its complex motion and severe occlusions. Furthermore, the technique shows generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to the VIP-HTD ice hockey dataset. The innovative approach of SportMamba addresses the difficulties in tracking players in fast-paced team sports scenarios with ambiguous appearance cues and non-linear motion patterns, making it a valuable tool for sports analytics and video analysis in sports broadcasting.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in team sports is particularly challenging due to the fast-paced motion and frequent occlusions resulting in motion blur and identity switches, respectively. Predicting player positions in such scenarios is particularly difficult due to the observed highly non-linear motion patterns. Current methods are heavily reliant on object detection and appearance-based tracking, which struggle to perform in complex team sports scenarios, where appearance cues are ambiguous and motion patterns do not necessarily follow a linear pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce SportMamba, an adaptive hybrid MOT technique specifically designed for tracking in dynamic team sports. The technical contribution of SportMamba is twofold. First, we introduce a mamba-attention mechanism that models non-linear motion by implicitly focusing on relevant embedding dependencies. Second, we propose a height-adaptive spatial association metric to reduce ID switches caused by partial occlusions by accounting for scale variations due to depth changes. Additionally, we extend the detection search space with adaptive buffers to improve associations in fast-motion scenarios. Our proposed technique, SportMamba, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various metrics in the SportsMOT dataset, which is characterized by complex motion and severe occlusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to VIP-HTD, an ice hockey dataset.

Abstract: The Arrow of Time (AoT)-time's irreversible flow shaping physical events-is fundamental to video comprehension, yet remains a significant challenge for modern large multimodal models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to perceive and utilize temporal directionality in video when responding to language queries, obstructing deeper temporal understanding. We tackle this deficiency by first providing a critical analysis of existing benchmarks and models. We then introduce ArrowRL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training strategy with an innovative reverse reward that instills AoT awareness by encouraging divergent video interpretations between forward and reversed visual frames. For rigorous evaluation, we additionally develop AoTBench, a new multi-faceted benchmark probing temporally challenging questions. Experiments show ArrowRL greatly advances temporal perception: it not only achieves substantial improvements on our challenging AoTBench but also demonstrably boosts performance on standard video question answering (VQA) benchmarks (with peak accuracy gains reaching over 20% and 10% respectively). This validates ArrowRL's effectiveness and highlights the critical need for dedicated AoT understanding in LMMs.

Abstract: Controlling defects in semiconductor processes is important for maintaining yield, improving production cost, and preventing time-dependent critical component failures. Electron beam-based imaging has been used as a tool to survey wafers in the line and inspect for defects. However, manual classification of images for these nano-scale defects is limited by time, labor constraints, and human biases. In recent years, deep learning computer vision algorithms have shown to be effective solutions for image-based inspection applications in industry. This work proposes application of vision transformer (ViT) neural networks for automatic defect classification (ADC) of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of wafer defects. We evaluated our proposed methods on 300mm wafer semiconductor defect data from our fab in IBM Albany. We studied 11 defect types from over 7400 total images and investigated the potential of transfer learning of DinoV2 and semi-supervised learning for improved classification accuracy and efficient computation. We were able to achieve classification accuracies of over 90% with less than 15 images per defect class. Our work demonstrates the potential to apply the proposed framework for a platform agnostic in-house classification tool with faster turnaround time and flexibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled accurate image-based geolocation, raising serious concerns about location privacy risks in everyday social media posts. However, current benchmarks remain coarse-grained, linguistically biased, and lack multimodal and privacy-aware evaluations. To address these gaps, we present KoreaGEO Bench, the first fine-grained, multimodal geolocation benchmark for Korean street views. Our dataset comprises 1,080 high-resolution images sampled across four urban clusters and nine place types, enriched with multi-contextual annotations and two styles of Korean captions simulating real-world privacy exposure. We introduce a three-path evaluation protocol to assess ten mainstream VLMs under varying input modalities and analyze their accuracy, spatial bias, and reasoning behavior. Results reveal modality-driven shifts in localization precision and highlight structural prediction biases toward core cities.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have begun to transform image analysis by acting as pretrained generalist backbones that can be adapted to many tasks even when post-training data are limited, yet their impact on spatial proteomics, imaging that maps proteins at single-cell resolution, remains limited. Here, we introduce KRONOS, a foundation model built for spatial proteomics. KRONOS was trained in a self-supervised manner on over 47 million image patches covering 175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, and 8 fluorescence-based imaging platforms. We introduce key architectural adaptations to address the high-dimensional, multi-channel, and heterogeneous nature of multiplex imaging. We demonstrate that KRONOS learns biologically meaningful representations across multiple scales, ranging from cellular and microenvironment to tissue levels, enabling it to address diverse downstream tasks, including cell phenotyping, region classification, and patient stratification. Evaluated across 11 independent cohorts, KRONOS achieves state-of-the-art performance across cell phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and retrieval tasks, and is highly data-efficient. KRONOS also introduces the paradigm of segmentation-free patch-level processing for efficient and scalable spatial proteomics analysis, allowing cross-institutional comparisons, and as an image reverse search engine for spatial patterns. Together, these results position KRONOS as a flexible and scalable tool for spatial proteomics. The model is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS.

Summary: 
This study explores the connection between urban sounds and visual scenes in London, New York, and Tokyo by comparing different visual representation methods. Street view embeddings show better alignment with environmental sounds than segmentation outputs. Remote sensing segmentation is more effective in interpreting ecological categories following a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony (BGA) framework. Embedding-based models offer superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This research contributes to the field of multimodal urban sensing by providing insights on incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Environmental soundscapes convey substantial ecological and social information regarding urban environments; however, their potential remains largely untapped in large-scale geographic analysis. In this study, we investigate the extent to which urban sounds correspond with visual scenes by comparing various visual representation strategies in capturing acoustic semantics. We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound recordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major global cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio, along with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV for semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to evaluate cross-modal similarity. The results indicate that street view embeddings demonstrate stronger alignment with environmental sounds compared to segmentation outputs, whereas remote sensing segmentation is more effective in interpreting ecological categories through a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony (BGA) framework. These findings imply that embedding-based models offer superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This work advances the burgeoning field of multimodal urban sensing by offering novel perspectives for incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.

<div> EigenCL, unsupervised contrastive learning, crop stress detection, NDRE dynamics, precision agriculture<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
A new approach, EigenCL, for early detection of crop stress in precision agriculture is introduced. By utilizing over 10,000 Sentinel-2 NDRE image patches from drought-affected Iowa cornfields, EigenCL constructs five-point NDRE time series per patch and derives an RBF similarity matrix. The principal eigenvector, strongly correlated with NDRE values, defines stress-aware similarity for contrastive embedding learning. This method, based on biologically similar stress trajectories, enables early stress detection up to 12 days before traditional NDRE thresholds, achieving superior clustering metrics and high accuracy in downstream classification tasks. EigenCL offers a label-free, scalable solution aligned with plant physiology, suitable for deployment in data-scarce agricultural environments. Validation on an independent dataset confirms its generalizability without the need for retraining. <div>

Abstract: Early detection of crop stress is vital for minimizing yield loss and enabling timely intervention in precision agriculture. Traditional approaches using NDRE often detect stress only after visible symptoms appear or require labeled datasets, limiting scalability. This study introduces EigenCL, a novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework guided by temporal NDRE dynamics and biologically grounded eigen decomposition. Using over 10,000 Sentinel-2 NDRE image patches from drought-affected Iowa cornfields, we constructed five-point NDRE time series per patch and derived an RBF similarity matrix. The principal eigenvector explaining 76% of the variance and strongly correlated (r = 0.95) with raw NDRE values was used to define stress-aware similarity for contrastive embedding learning. Unlike existing methods that rely on visual augmentations, EigenCL pulls embeddings together based on biologically similar stress trajectories and pushes apart divergent ones. The learned embeddings formed physiologically meaningful clusters, achieving superior clustering metrics (Silhouette: 0.748, DBI: 0.35) and enabling 76% early stress detection up to 12 days before conventional NDRE thresholds. Downstream classification yielded 95% k-NN and 91% logistic regression accuracy. Validation on an independent 2023 Nebraska dataset confirmed generalizability without retraining. EigenCL offers a label-free, scalable approach for early stress detection that aligns with underlying plant physiology and is suitable for real-world deployment in data-scarce agricultural environments.

<div> Efficient Vision Foundation Models, ViT-Split, CNN, VFM, adapters <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces ViT-Split, a novel approach for enhancing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) by dividing the model into extractor and adapter components. By eliminating the CNN branch and incorporating task and prior heads, ViT-Split addresses early layer gradient backpropagation and reduces complexity. The extractor focuses on learning low-level features, while the adapter tailors task-specific features, improving efficiency. The prior head leverages multi-scale prior features from the frozen VFM, reducing parameter tuning and overfitting. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks validate ViT-Split's efficacy and efficiency, showcasing up to a 4x reduction in training time while achieving comparable or superior results, particularly on the ADE20K dataset. Overall, ViT-Split offers a streamlined and effective solution for optimizing VFMs and enhancing performance across diverse visual tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. While several VFM adapters have shown promising results by leveraging the prior knowledge of VFMs, we identify two inefficiencies in these approaches. First, the interaction between convolutional neural network (CNN) and VFM backbone triggers early layer gradient backpropagation. Second, existing methods require tuning all components, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features, underutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of several VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an extractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning task-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch and introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task head is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient propagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior features from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting. Extensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth estimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ViT-Split. Specifically, ViT-Split reduces training time up to $4\times$ while achieving comparable or even better results on ADE20K, compared to other VFM adapters.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the GeoVis-GNN method, which combines visual and geometric features for improved Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition. By using dual-attention feature fusion and entity graph learning, the model progressively builds from entity-specific representations towards high-level interaction understanding. A new dataset, MPHOI-120, captures dynamic multi-person interactions with concurrent actions and partial engagement, addressing challenges like complex dynamics and occlusions. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various HOI scenarios, including two-person interactions, single-person activities, bimanual manipulations, and complex concurrent interactions. <div>

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition in videos requires understanding both visual patterns and geometric relationships as they evolve over time. Visual and geometric features offer complementary strengths. Visual features capture appearance context, while geometric features provide structural patterns. Effectively fusing these multimodal features without compromising their unique characteristics remains challenging. We observe that establishing robust, entity-specific representations before modeling interactions helps preserve the strengths of each modality. Therefore, we hypothesize that a bottom-up approach is crucial for effective multimodal fusion. Following this insight, we propose the Geometric Visual Fusion Graph Neural Network (GeoVis-GNN), which uses dual-attention feature fusion combined with interdependent entity graph learning. It progressively builds from entity-specific representations toward high-level interaction understanding. To advance HOI recognition to real-world scenarios, we introduce the Concurrent Partial Interaction Dataset (MPHOI-120). It captures dynamic multi-person interactions involving concurrent actions and partial engagement. This dataset helps address challenges like complex human-object dynamics and mutual occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various HOI scenarios. These scenarios include two-person interactions, single-person activities, bimanual manipulations, and complex concurrent partial interactions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in inversion and instruction-based image editing, existing approaches primarily excel at editing single, prominent objects but significantly struggle when applied to complex scenes containing multiple entities. To quantify this gap, we first introduce RefEdit-Bench, a rigorous real-world benchmark rooted in RefCOCO, where even baselines trained on millions of samples perform poorly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce RefEdit -- an instruction-based editing model trained on our scalable synthetic data generation pipeline. Our RefEdit, trained on only 20,000 editing triplets, outperforms the Flux/SD3 model-based baselines trained on millions of data. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that our model not only excels in referring expression tasks but also enhances performance on traditional benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results comparable to closed-source methods. We release data \& checkpoint for reproducibility.

<div> Keywords: rendering engines, synthetic images, deep learning, computer vision, dataset supplementation <br />
<br />
Summary: This paper explores the use of rendering engines, particularly Unreal Engine 4, to generate synthetic images for deep learning computer vision models. Synthetic images offer advantages such as reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility of training data without internet threats. The study evaluates the validity of synthetic images by testing their impact on model accuracy in binary classification tasks. Results show that adding synthetic images to real datasets can improve test accuracy and reduce the gap between training and test accuracy. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that using synthetic images allows researchers to train models with only a fraction of real images typically required. Guidelines for creating and utilizing synthetic images are provided, highlighting the potential performance improvements for data-scarce projects in computer vision. <div>
arXiv:2506.03449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how rendering engines, like Unreal Engine 4 (UE), can be used to create synthetic images to supplement datasets for deep computer vision (CV) models in image abundant and image limited use cases. Using rendered synthetic images from UE can provide developers and businesses with a method of accessing nearly unlimited, reproducible, agile, and cheap training sets for their customers and applications without the threat of poisoned images from the internet or the cost of collecting them. The validity of these generated images are examined by testing the change in model test accuracy in two different sized CV models across two binary classification cases (Cat vs Dog and Weld Defect Detection). In addition, this paper provides an implementation of how to measure the quality of synthetic images by using pre-trained CV models as auditors. Results imply that for large (VGG16) and small (MobileNetV3-small) parameter deep CV models, adding >60% additional synthetic images to a real image dataset during model training can narrow the test-training accuracy gap to ~1-2% without a conclusive effect on test accuracy compared to using real world images alone. Likewise, adding <10% additional real training images to synthetic only training sets decreased the classification error rate in half, then decreasing further when adding more real training images. For these cases tested, using synthetic images from rendering engines allow researchers to only use 10% of their real images during training, compared to the traditional 50-70%. This research serves as an example of how to create synthetic images, guidelines on how to use the images, potential restrictions and possible performance improvements for data-scarce projects.

<div> Neural field-based image approach, few-shot learning, noisy labels, robustness, soft clustering <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a robust neural field-based image approach (RoNFA) for few-shot image classification in the presence of label errors. RoNFA comprises two neural fields for feature and category representation. Each neuron in the field for category representation (FCR) has a receptive field (RF) on the field for feature representation (FFR) centered at the representative neuron for its category, determined through soft clustering. During the prediction stage, the range of these receptive fields adapts based on neuronal activation in FCR for improved accuracy. Experimental results on real-world FSL datasets with various label noise types show that RoNFA outperforms existing FSL methods. Its accuracy with noisy labels exceeds that of state-of-the-art methods trained on clean support sets, highlighting its robustness against label errors. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In few-shot learning (FSL), the labeled samples are scarce. Thus, label errors can significantly reduce classification accuracy. Since label errors are inevitable in realistic learning tasks, improving the robustness of the model in the presence of label errors is critical. This paper proposes a new robust neural field-based image approach (RoNFA) for few-shot image classification with noisy labels. RoNFA consists of two neural fields for feature and category representation. They correspond to the feature space and category set. Each neuron in the field for category representation (FCR) has a receptive field (RF) on the field for feature representation (FFR) centered at the representative neuron for its category generated by soft clustering. In the prediction stage, the range of these receptive fields adapts according to the neuronal activation in FCR to ensure prediction accuracy. These learning strategies provide the proposed model with excellent few-shot learning capability and strong robustness against label noises. The experimental results on real-world FSL datasets with three different types of label noise demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FSL methods. Its accuracy obtained in the presence of noisy labels even surpasses the results obtained by state-of-the-art FSL methods trained on clean support sets, indicating its strong robustness against noisy labels.

Summary:
This article focuses on addressing the challenges of heterogeneous skeleton-based human action recognition by developing a novel framework for action representation learning. The framework consists of two main components: heterogeneous skeleton processing and unified representation learning. The former involves converting two-dimensional skeleton data into three-dimensional skeletons and constructing a unified skeleton using specific prompts. Additionally, semantic motion encoding is introduced to capture semantic information within skeletons. The latter component learns a shared action representation using a common backbone network that can handle different heterogeneous skeletons.

This approach has potential applications in action recognition for robots with diverse humanoid structures.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition has received widespread attention in recent years due to its diverse range of application scenarios. Due to the different sources of human skeletons, skeleton data naturally exhibit heterogeneity. The previous works, however, overlook the heterogeneity of human skeletons and solely construct models tailored for homogeneous skeletons. This work addresses the challenge of heterogeneous skeleton-based action representation learning, specifically focusing on processing skeleton data that varies in joint dimensions and topological structures. The proposed framework comprises two primary components: heterogeneous skeleton processing and unified representation learning. The former first converts two-dimensional skeleton data into three-dimensional skeleton via an auxiliary network, and then constructs a prompted unified skeleton using skeleton-specific prompts. We also design an additional modality named semantic motion encoding to harness the semantic information within skeletons. The latter module learns a unified action representation using a shared backbone network that processes different heterogeneous skeletons. Extensive experiments on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various tasks of action understanding. Our approach can be applied to action recognition in robots with different humanoid structures.

The paper introduces CHIME, a framework designed to enhance time series diffusion models. CHIME addresses challenges in multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different entities and long-time scales. By utilizing multi-scale decomposition and adaptive integration, CHIME captures decomposed features to align the distribution of generated and original samples. The framework also includes a feature hallucination module that transfers temporal features during the conditional denoising process, enhancing category-independent transformation layers. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that CHIME outperforms existing models, particularly in few-shot scenarios, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and strong generative generalization capabilities. <div>

Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model has become a mainstream generative model, achieving significant success in various computer vision tasks. Recently, there has been initial exploration of applying diffusion models to time series tasks. However, existing studies still face challenges in multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different entities and long-time scales. In this paper, we propose CHIME, a conditional hallucination and integrated multi-scale enhancement framework for time series diffusion models. By employing multi-scale decomposition and adaptive integration, CHIME captures the decomposed features of time series, achieving in-domain distribution alignment between generated and original samples. In addition, we introduce a feature hallucination module in the conditional denoising process, enabling the transfer of temporal features through the training of category-independent transformation layers. Experimental results on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that CHIME achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits excellent generative generalization capabilities in few-shot scenarios.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new lightweight event-based optical flow network called EDCFlow that aims to improve flow estimation at higher resolutions. The network utilizes a multi-scale temporal feature difference layer to efficiently capture diverse motion patterns at high resolution. By adaptively fusing high-resolution difference motion features with low-resolution correlation motion features, EDCFlow enhances motion representation and model generalization. Additionally, EDCFlow can be used as a plug-and-play refinement module for RAFT-like event-based methods to enhance flow details. Experimental results show that EDCFlow outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and complexity, offering superior generalization. <div>
arXiv:2506.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent learning-based methods for event-based optical flow estimation utilize cost volumes for pixel matching but suffer from redundant computations and limited scalability to higher resolutions for flow refinement. In this work, we take advantage of the complementarity between temporally dense feature differences of adjacent event frames and cost volume and present a lightweight event-based optical flow network (EDCFlow) to achieve high-quality flow estimation at a higher resolution. Specifically, an attention-based multi-scale temporal feature difference layer is developed to capture diverse motion patterns at high resolution in a computation-efficient manner. An adaptive fusion of high-resolution difference motion features and low-resolution correlation motion features is performed to enhance motion representation and model generalization. Notably, EDCFlow can serve as a plug-and-play refinement module for RAFT-like event-based methods to enhance flow details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDCFlow achieves better performance with lower complexity compared to existing methods, offering superior generalization.

<div> Keywords: Direct Preference Optimization, text-to-video diffusion models, DenseDPO, motion generation, Vision Language Models

Summary:
DenseDPO introduces a method to improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for text-to-video diffusion models. By using denoised copies of ground truth videos to create pairs for preference labeling, motion bias is neutralized, resulting in better motion generation. This method also allows for labeling preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, leading to a denser and more precise learning signal. DenseDPO achieves improvements in motion generation while maintaining text alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency compared to vanilla DPO. Additionally, DenseDPO enables automatic preference annotation using Vision Language Models, with GPT accurately predicting segment-level preferences. By training on these predicted labels, DenseDPO performance is close to using human labels. This new approach addresses the limitations of traditional DPO methods and enhances the capabilities of text-to-video diffusion models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been applied as a post-training technique for text-to-video diffusion models. To obtain training data, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated from independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained comparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion clips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce DenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three contributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted copies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar motion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing the motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and more precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO greatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that DenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences similar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO trained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.

Summary: 
The article introduces Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) that focuses on transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain dealing with domain and unknown category shifts. It addresses the challenge of identifying common class samples and aligning them by searching for semantic centers in a semantically meaningful and discrete text representation space. The proposed method, TArget Semantics Clustering (TASC), uses information maximization as an objective in two stages: searching for optimal text embeddings and refining encoders for domain alignment and private class clustering. Additionally, Universal Maximum Similarity (UniMS) is introduced for detecting open-set samples in UniDA. Experimentally tested on four benchmarks, the method proves effective and robust, achieving state-of-the-art performance in adapting to category shift scenarios. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) focuses on transferring source domain knowledge to the target domain under both domain shift and unknown category shift. Its main challenge lies in identifying common class samples and aligning them. Current methods typically obtain target domain semantics centers from an unconstrained continuous image representation space. Due to domain shift and the unknown number of clusters, these centers often result in complex and less robust alignment algorithm. In this paper, based on vision-language models, we search for semantic centers in a semantically meaningful and discrete text representation space. The constrained space ensures almost no domain bias and appropriate semantic granularity for these centers, enabling a simple and robust adaptation algorithm. Specifically, we propose TArget Semantics Clustering (TASC) via Text Representations, which leverages information maximization as a unified objective and involves two stages. First, with the frozen encoders, a greedy search-based framework is used to search for an optimal set of text embeddings to represent target semantics. Second, with the search results fixed, encoders are refined based on gradient descent, simultaneously achieving robust domain alignment and private class clustering. Additionally, we propose Universal Maximum Similarity (UniMS), a scoring function tailored for detecting open-set samples in UniDA. Experimentally, we evaluate the universality of UniDA algorithms under four category shift scenarios. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, which has achieved state-of-the-art performance.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Video-Skill-CoT (Video-SKoT) framework for domain-adaptive video reasoning by leveraging skill-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations. The framework extracts domain-specific reasoning skills from training questions, clusters them into a shared skill taxonomy, and creates detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair. It then employs skill-specific expert learning modules, each specializing in a subset of reasoning skills and trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines on three video understanding benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness. In-depth analyses are also provided, comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding, emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning. First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.

<div> 3D reconstruction, in-the-wild images, Gaussian Splatting, artifacts, scene geometry <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces Asymmetric Dual 3DGS, a framework for 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild images. It addresses challenges such as inconsistent lighting conditions and artifacts by training two 3D Gaussian Splatting models in parallel. These models are guided by a consistency constraint to converge on reliable scene geometry while suppressing artifacts. To prevent shared failures, divergent masking strategies are employed, including multi-cue adaptive masks and self-supervised soft masks. A lightweight variant, Dynamic EMA Proxy, enhances efficiency by using an Exponential Moving Average proxy and alternating masking. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over existing methods and high efficiency. The codes and trained models will be made available for further research. <br /> <div>

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild images remains a challenging task due to inconsistent lighting conditions and transient distractors. Existing methods typically rely on heuristic strategies to handle the low-quality training data, which often struggle to produce stable and consistent reconstructions, frequently resulting in visual artifacts. In this work, we propose Asymmetric Dual 3DGS, a novel framework that leverages the stochastic nature of these artifacts: they tend to vary across different training runs due to minor randomness. Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy, which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to preserve divergence. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches while achieving high efficiency. Codes and trained models will be released.

Abstract: Multimodal image fusion effectively aggregates information from diverse modalities, with fused images playing a crucial role in vision systems. However, existing methods often neglect frequency-domain feature exploration and interactive relationships. In this paper, we propose wavelet-aware Intra-inter Frequency Enhancement Fusion (WIFE-Fusion), a multimodal image fusion framework based on frequency-domain components interactions. Its core innovations include: Intra-Frequency Self-Attention (IFSA) that leverages inherent cross-modal correlations and complementarity through interactive self-attention mechanisms to extract enriched frequency-domain features, and Inter-Frequency Interaction (IFI) that enhances enriched features and filters latent features via combinatorial interactions between heterogeneous frequency-domain components across modalities. These processes achieve precise source feature extraction and unified modeling of feature extraction-aggregation. Extensive experiments on five datasets across three multimodal fusion tasks demonstrate WIFE-Fusion's superiority over current specialized and unified fusion methods.

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation is a complex and challenging task that integrates the paradigms of computer vision and natural language processing. Existing datasets for RRSIS suffer from critical limitations in resolution, scene diversity, and category coverage, which hinders the generalization and real-world applicability of refer segmentation models.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new framework called BiMa that aims to address biases present in visual and textual representations in text-video retrieval (TVR) systems.

Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.

Summary:
Unified multimodal large language models based on end-to-end autoregressive transformers aim to integrate understanding and generation tasks but face challenges due to task objective conflicts. Existing solutions like decoupling shared visual encoders are limited in resolving these conflicts. This paper introduces UTAMoE, a Unified Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts framework that decouples internal AR modules to address task conflicts effectively. The framework includes a Task-Aware MoE Layer for task-specific optimization subpaths and utilizes a Two-Stage Training Strategy for enhanced task differentiation.

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on end-to-end autoregressive (AR) transformers effectively integrate both understanding and generation tasks within a single framework. However, intrinsic Task Objective Conflicts between high-level semantic abstraction in understanding and fine-grained detail preservation in generation pose significant challenges, often leading to suboptimal trade-offs and task interference. Existing solutions, such as decoupling shared visual encoders, fall short of fundamentally resolving these conflicts due to inherent AR architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that decouples internal components of AR to resolve task objective conflicts. Specifically, we design UTAMoE, a Unified Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that decouples internal AR modules via a Task-Aware MoE Layer to create task-specific optimization subpaths. To enhance task differentiation while maintaining overall coordination, we introduce a novel Two-Stage Training Strategy. Extensive experiments on multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that UTAMoE mitigates task objective conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. Visualizations and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

arXiv:2506.03596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of controllable image generation has seen significant advancements, with various architectures improving generation layout consistency with control signals. However, contemporary methods still face challenges in bridging the semantic gap between input text prompts with sparse semantics and the target images, often over-relying on low-level control signals to infer regional details. To address this challenge, we propose ControlThinker, a novel framework that employs a "comprehend-then-generate" paradigm. Firstly, by incentivizing the visual reasoning capability of a MLLM, latent semantics from control images are mined to enrich text prompts. This enriched semantic understanding then seamlessly aids in image generation without the need for additional complex modifications. To further tackle the uncertainty arising from the ambiguity of control images, we encourage broader exploration of reasoning trajectories and select the optimal one using a metric-based output reward model (ORM). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ControlThinker effectively mitigates the semantic gap between raw text prompts and target images, resulting in improved visual quality and semantic consistency across a wide range of benchmarks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Maplebb/ControlThinker.

Abstract: Learning to use tools or objects in common scenes, particularly handling them in various ways as instructed, is a key challenge for developing interactive robots. Training models to generate such manipulation trajectories requires a large and diverse collection of detailed manipulation demonstrations for various objects, which is nearly unfeasible to gather at scale. In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages large-scale ego- and exo-centric video datasets -- constructed globally with substantial effort -- of Exo-Ego4D to extract diverse manipulation trajectories at scale. From these extracted trajectories with the associated textual action description, we develop trajectory generation models based on visual and point cloud-based language models. In the recently proposed egocentric vision-based in-a-quality trajectory dataset of HOT3D, we confirmed that our models successfully generate valid object trajectories, establishing a training dataset and baseline models for the novel task of generating 6DoF manipulation trajectories from action descriptions in egocentric vision.

Abstract: Edge computing decentralizes processing power to network edge, enabling real-time AI-driven decision-making in IoT applications. In industrial automation such as robotics and rugged edge AI, real-time perception and intelligence are critical for autonomous operations. Deploying transformer-based image captioning models at the edge can enhance machine perception, improve scene understanding for autonomous robots, and aid in industrial inspection.
  However, these edge or IoT devices are often constrained in computational resources for physical agility, yet they have strict response time requirements. Traditional deep learning models can be too large and computationally demanding for these devices. In this research, we present findings of transformer-based models for image captioning that operate effectively on edge devices. By evaluating resource-effective transformer models and applying knowledge distillation techniques, we demonstrate inference can be accelerated on resource-constrained devices while maintaining model performance using these techniques.

Abstract: Detecting lesions in Computed Tomography (CT) scans is a challenging task in medical image processing due to the diverse types, sizes, and locations of lesions. Recently, various one-stage and two-stage framework networks have been developed to focus on lesion localization. We introduce a one-stage lesion detection framework, PDSE, by redesigning Retinanet to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency for detecting lesions in multimodal CT images. Specifically, we enhance the path aggregation flow by incorporating a low-level feature map. Additionally, to improve model representation, we utilize the adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block and integrate channel feature map attention. This approach has resulted in achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Our method significantly improves the detection of small and multiscaled objects. When evaluated against other advanced algorithms on the public DeepLesion benchmark, our algorithm achieved an mAP of over 0.20.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe." We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID: we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch}, \texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference. Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks. Code is available at https://github.com/ZHZisZZ/visual-stitching.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for sign language recognition (SLR) focus mainly on isolated SLR, while there are limited datasets for continuous SLR (CSLR), which recognizes sequences of signs in a video. Additionally, existing CSLR datasets are collected in controlled settings, which restricts their effectiveness in building robust real-world CSLR systems. To address these limitations, we present Isharah, a large multi-scene dataset for CSLR. It is the first dataset of its type and size that has been collected in an unconstrained environment using signers' smartphone cameras. This setup resulted in high variations of recording settings, camera distances, angles, and resolutions. This variation helps with developing sign language understanding models capable of handling the variability and complexity of real-world scenarios. The dataset consists of 30,000 video clips performed by 18 deaf and professional signers. Additionally, the dataset is linguistically rich as it provides a gloss-level annotation for all dataset's videos, making it useful for developing CSLR and sign language translation (SLT) systems. This paper also introduces multiple sign language understanding benchmarks, including signer-independent and unseen-sentence CSLR, along with gloss-based and gloss-free SLT. The Isharah dataset is available on https://snalyami.github.io/Isharah_CSLR/.

arXiv:2506.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Subject Fidelity Optimization (SFO), a novel comparative learning framework for zero-shot subject-driven generation that enhances subject fidelity. Beyond supervised fine-tuning methods that rely only on positive targets and use the diffusion loss as in the pre-training stage, SFO introduces synthetic negative targets and explicitly guides the model to favor positives over negatives through pairwise comparison. For negative targets, we propose Condition-Degradation Negative Sampling (CDNS), which automatically generates distinctive and informative negatives by intentionally degrading visual and textual cues without expensive human annotations. Moreover, we reweight the diffusion timesteps to focus finetuning on intermediate steps where subject details emerge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFO with CDNS significantly outperforms baselines in terms of both subject fidelity and text alignment on a subject-driven generation benchmark.

Abstract: A major challenge in finger vein recognition is the lack of large-scale public datasets. Existing datasets contain few identities and limited samples per finger, restricting the advancement of deep learning-based methods. To address this, we introduce FVeinSyn, a synthetic generator capable of producing diverse finger vein patterns with rich intra-class variations. Using FVeinSyn, we created FingerVeinSyn-5M -- the largest available finger vein dataset -- containing 5 million samples from 50,000 unique fingers, each with 100 variations including shift, rotation, scale, roll, varying exposure levels, skin scattering blur, optical blur, and motion blur. FingerVeinSyn-5M is also the first to offer fully annotated finger vein images, supporting deep learning applications in this field. Models pretrained on FingerVeinSyn-5M and fine-tuned with minimal real data achieve an average 53.91\% performance gain across multiple benchmarks. The dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/EvanWang98/FingerVeinSyn-5M.

Abstract: Visual-spatial understanding, the ability to infer object relationships and layouts from visual input, is fundamental to downstream tasks such as robotic navigation and embodied interaction. However, existing methods face spatial uncertainty and data scarcity, limiting the 3D spatial reasoning capability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in pre-trained VLMs without modifying their architecture. This framework combines SpatialMind, a structured prompting strategy that decomposes complex scenes and questions into interpretable reasoning steps, with ScanForgeQA, a scalable question-answering dataset built from diverse 3D simulation scenes through an automated construction process designed for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the individual and combined effectiveness of our prompting and fine-tuning strategies, and yield insights that may inspire future research on visual-spatial understanding.

Abstract: Most existing vision encoders map images into a fixed-length sequence of tokens, overlooking the fact that different images contain varying amounts of information. For example, a visually complex image (e.g., a cluttered room) inherently carries more information and thus deserves more tokens than a simple image (e.g., a blank wall). To address this inefficiency, we propose DOVE, a dynamic vision encoder that produces a variable number of visual tokens (i.e., continuous representation vectors) to reconstruct each image. Our results show that DOVE significantly reduces the average number of tokens while maintaining high reconstruction quality. In several linear probing and downstream multimodal tasks, it outperforms existing autoencoder-based tokenization methods when using far fewer tokens, capturing more expressive semantic features compared to fixed-length encoding. We further extend DOVE with query-conditioned tokenization. By guiding the model to focus on query-relevant regions, it achieves more efficient and targeted semantic extraction. Our code and checkpoints are available at https://dove-encoder.github.io/dove-encoder.

<title>YOND: Practical Blind Raw Image Denoising Free from Camera-Specific Data Dependency</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of photography has created a growing demand for a practical blind raw image denoising method. Recently, learning-based methods have become mainstream due to their excellent performance. However, most existing learning-based methods suffer from camera-specific data dependency, resulting in performance drops when applied to data from unknown cameras. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel blind raw image denoising method named YOND, which represents You Only Need a Denoiser. Trained solely on synthetic data, YOND can generalize robustly to noisy raw images captured by diverse unknown cameras. Specifically, we propose three key modules to guarantee the practicality of YOND: coarse-to-fine noise estimation (CNE), expectation-matched variance-stabilizing transform (EM-VST), and SNR-guided denoiser (SNR-Net). Firstly, we propose CNE to identify the camera noise characteristic, refining the estimated noise parameters based on the coarse denoised image. Secondly, we propose EM-VST to eliminate camera-specific data dependency, correcting the bias expectation of VST according to the noisy image. Finally, we propose SNR-Net to offer controllable raw image denoising, supporting adaptive adjustments and manual fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on unknown cameras, along with flexible solutions for challenging cases, demonstrate the superior practicality of our method. The source code will be publicly available at the \href{https://fenghansen.github.io/publication/YOND}{project homepage}.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion models, text-to-image generation has achieved significant progress in image resolution, detail fidelity, and semantic alignment, particularly with models like Stable Diffusion 3.5, Stable Diffusion XL, and FLUX 1. However, generating emotionally expressive and abstract artistic images remains a major challenge, largely due to the lack of large-scale, fine-grained emotional datasets. To address this gap, we present the EmoArt Dataset -- one of the most comprehensive emotion-annotated art datasets to date. It contains 132,664 artworks across 56 painting styles (e.g., Impressionism, Expressionism, Abstract Art), offering rich stylistic and cultural diversity. Each image includes structured annotations: objective scene descriptions, five key visual attributes (brushwork, composition, color, line, light), binary arousal-valence labels, twelve emotion categories, and potential art therapy effects. Using EmoArt, we systematically evaluate popular text-to-image diffusion models for their ability to generate emotionally aligned images from text. Our work provides essential data and benchmarks for emotion-driven image synthesis and aims to advance fields such as affective computing, multimodal learning, and computational art, enabling applications in art therapy and creative design. The dataset and more details can be accessed via our project website.

<title>MambaNeXt-YOLO: A Hybrid State Space Model for Real-time Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Real-time object detection is a fundamental but challenging task in computer vision, particularly when computational resources are limited. Although YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy, the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba, provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our method achieved 66.6\% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Orin NX.

<title>INP-Former++: Advancing Universal Anomaly Detection via Intrinsic Normal Prototypes and Residual Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03660</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03660</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for industrial inspection and medical diagnosis, yet existing methods typically rely on ``comparing'' test images to normal references from a training set. However, variations in appearance and positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test image, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as local variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information originate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external normality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image. Specifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then guide the INP-guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with reconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a Soft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training. INP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class, and few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a versatile and universal solution for AD. Remarkably, INP-Former also demonstrates some zero-shot AD capability. Furthermore, we propose a soft version of the INP Coherence Loss and enhance INP-Former by incorporating residual learning, leading to the development of INP-Former++. The proposed method significantly improves detection performance across single-class, multi-class, semi-supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.

<title>Zero-Shot Temporal Interaction Localization for Egocentric Videos</title>

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have achieved remarkable success. Training them is often accelerated by building on top of pre-trained models which poses the risk of perpetuating encoded biases. Here, we investigate biases in the representations of commonly used ImageNet classifiers for facial images while considering intersections of sensitive variables age, race and gender. To assess the biases, we use linear classifier probes and visualize activations as topographic maps. We find that representations in ImageNet classifiers particularly allow differentiation between ages. Less strongly pronounced, the models appear to associate certain ethnicities and distinguish genders in middle-aged groups.

Abstract: This paper introduces a preprocessing technique to speed up Structure-from-Motion (SfM) based pose estimation, which is critical for real-time applications like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and robotics. Our method leverages the concept of a dominating set from graph theory to preprocess SfM models, significantly enhancing the speed of the pose estimation process without losing significant accuracy. Using the OnePose dataset, we evaluated our method across various SfM-based pose estimation techniques. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in processing speed, ranging from 1.5 to 14.48 times, and a reduction in reference images and point cloud size by factors of 17-23 and 2.27-4, respectively. This work offers a promising solution for efficient and accurate 3D pose estimation, balancing speed and accuracy in real-time applications.

<title>BiXFormer: A Robust Framework for Maximizing Modality Effectiveness in Multi-Modal Semantic Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03675</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing multi-modal data enhances scene understanding by providing complementary semantic and geometric information. Existing methods fuse features or distill knowledge from multiple modalities into a unified representation, improving robustness but restricting each modality's ability to fully leverage its strengths in different situations. We reformulate multi-modal semantic segmentation as a mask-level classification task and propose BiXFormer, which integrates Unified Modality Matching (UMM) and Cross Modality Alignment (CMA) to maximize modality effectiveness and handle missing modalities. Specifically, BiXFormer first categorizes multi-modal inputs into RGB and X, where X represents any non-RGB modalities, e.g., depth, allowing separate processing for each. This design leverages the well-established pretraining for RGB, while addressing the relative lack of attention to X modalities. Then, we propose UMM, which includes Modality Agnostic Matching (MAM) and Complementary Matching (CM). MAM assigns labels to features from all modalities without considering modality differences, leveraging each modality's strengths. CM then reassigns unmatched labels to remaining unassigned features within their respective modalities, ensuring that each available modality contributes to the final prediction and mitigating the impact of missing modalities. Moreover, to further facilitate UMM, we introduce CMA, which enhances the weaker queries assigned in CM by aligning them with optimally matched queries from MAM. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving significant improvements in mIoU of +2.75% and +22.74% over the prior arts.

<title>How PARTs assemble into wholes: Learning the relative composition of images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition of objects and their parts, along with object-object positional relationships, provides a rich source of information for representation learning. Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively explored in self-supervised learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid structure, where the goal of the pretext task involves predicting the absolute position index of patches within a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches fall short of capturing the fluid and continuous nature of real-world object compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised learning approach that leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid patches to overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other in a continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid structural relative positioning process that generalizes beyond occlusions and deformations. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object detection and time series prediction, PART outperforms strong grid-based methods like MAE and DropPos, while also maintaining competitive performance on global classification tasks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. By breaking free from grid constraints, PART opens up an exciting new trajectory for universal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from natural images to EEG signals-with promising potential in video, medical imaging, and audio.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has enabled remarkable creative capabilities, yet it also raises urgent concerns regarding the safety of AI-generated visual content in real-world applications such as content moderation, platform governance, and digital media regulation. This includes unsafe material such as sexually explicit images, violent scenes, hate symbols, propaganda, and unauthorized imitations of copyrighted artworks. Existing image safety systems often rely on rigid category filters and produce binary outputs, lacking the capacity to interpret context or reason about nuanced, adversarially induced forms of harm. In addition, standard evaluation metrics (e.g., attack success rate) fail to capture the semantic severity and dynamic progression of toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose Perception-Retrieval-Judgement (PRJ), a cognitively inspired framework that models toxicity detection as a structured reasoning process. PRJ follows a three-stage design: it first transforms an image into descriptive language (perception), then retrieves external knowledge related to harm categories and traits (retrieval), and finally evaluates toxicity based on legal or normative rules (judgement). This language-centric structure enables the system to detect both explicit and implicit harms with improved interpretability and categorical granularity. In addition, we introduce a dynamic scoring mechanism based on a contextual toxicity risk matrix to quantify harmfulness across different semantic dimensions. Experiments show that PRJ surpasses existing safety checkers in detection accuracy and robustness while uniquely supporting structured category-level toxicity interpretation.

Abstract: In the childbirth process, traditional methods involve invasive vaginal examinations, but research has shown that these methods are both subjective and inaccurate. Ultrasound-assisted diagnosis offers an objective yet effective way to assess fetal head position via two key parameters: Angle of Progression (AoP) and Head-Symphysis Distance (HSD), calculated by segmenting the fetal head (FH) and pubic symphysis (PS), which aids clinicians in ensuring a smooth delivery process. Therefore, accurate segmentation of FH and PS is crucial. In this work, we propose a sparse self-attention network architecture with good performance and high computational efficiency, named DSSAU-Net, for the segmentation of FH and PS. Specifically, we stack varying numbers of Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) blocks at each stage to form a symmetric U-shaped encoder-decoder network architecture. For a given query, DSSA is designed to explicitly perform one sparse token selection at both the region and pixel levels, respectively, which is beneficial for further reducing computational complexity while extracting the most relevant features. To compensate for the information loss during the upsampling process, skip connections with convolutions are designed. Additionally, multiscale feature fusion is employed to enrich the model's global and local information. The performance of DSSAU-Net has been validated using the Intrapartum Ultrasound Grand Challenge (IUGC) 2024 \textit{test set} provided by the organizer in the MICCAI IUGC 2024 competition\footnote{\href{https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/18413\#learn\_the\_details}{https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/18413\#learn\_the\_details}}, where we win the fourth place on the tasks of classification and segmentation, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) entails assigning semantic labels to each pixel in an image using textual descriptions, typically leveraging world models such as CLIP. To enhance out-of-domain generalization, we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV-COAST) for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To align visual-language features within the framework of optimal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two distributions. Our approach adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: in the first stage, the optimal transport problem is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to obtain an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is used to guide the training of the CAT-Seg model. We evaluate state-of-the-art OVSS models on the MESS benchmark, where our approach notably improves the performance of the cost-aggregation model CAT-Seg with ViT-B backbone, achieving superior results, surpassing CAT-Seg by 1.72 % and SAN-B by 4.9 % mIoU.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods aim to predict the 3D structure of a scene directly from input images, providing a faster alternative to per-scene optimization approaches. Significant progress has been made in single-view and few-view reconstruction using learned priors that infer object shape and appearance, even for unobserved regions. However, there is substantial potential to enhance these methods by better leveraging information from multiple views when available. To address this, we propose a few-view reconstruction model that more effectively harnesses multi-view information. Our approach introduces a simple mechanism that connects the 3D representation with pixel rays from the input views, allowing for preferential sharing of information between nearby 3D locations and between 3D locations and nearby pixel rays. We achieve this by defining the 3D representation as a set of structured, feature-augmented lines; the Pl\"uckeRF representation. Using this representation, we demonstrate improvements in reconstruction quality over the equivalent triplane representation and state-of-the-art feedforward reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Fully sparse 3D detectors have recently gained significant attention due to their efficiency in long-range detection. However, sparse 3D detectors extract features only from non-empty voxels, which impairs long-range interactions and causes the center feature missing. The former weakens the feature extraction capability, while the latter hinders network optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce the Fully Sparse Hybrid Network (FSHNet). FSHNet incorporates a proposed SlotFormer block to enhance the long-range feature extraction capability of existing sparse encoders. The SlotFormer divides sparse voxels using a slot partition approach, which, compared to traditional window partition, provides a larger receptive field. Additionally, we propose a dynamic sparse label assignment strategy to deeply optimize the network by providing more high-quality positive samples. To further enhance performance, we introduce a sparse upsampling module to refine downsampled voxels, preserving fine-grained details crucial for detecting small objects. Extensive experiments on the Waymo, nuScenes, and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of FSHNet. The code is available at https://github.com/Say2L/FSHNet.

arXiv:2506.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized various regions since it was proposed, and its effectiveness largely depends on the ability to encode positional information. Traditional position encoding methods exhibit significant limitations due to lack of robustness and flexibility of position. Therefore, Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) was proposed to alleviate these issues, which integrates positional information by rotating the embeddings in the attention mechanism. However, RoPE requires manually defined rotation matrices with limited transformation space, constraining the model's capacity. In this work, we propose ComRoPE, which generalizes RoPE by defining it in terms of trainable commuting angle matrices. Specifically, we demonstrate that pairwise commutativity of these matrices is essential for RoPE to achieve scalability and positional robustness. We formally define the RoPE Equation, which is an essential condition that ensures consistent performance with position offsets. Based on the theoretical analysis, we present two types of trainable commuting angle matrices as sufficient solutions to the RoPE equation, which significantly improve performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art method by 1.6% at training resolution and 2.9% at higher resolution on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, our framework shows versatility in generalizing to existing RoPE formulations and offering new insights for future positional encoding research.

At present, models based on Transformers have shone brightly in the field of super-resolution due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in information. However, current methods typically compute self-attention in nonoverlapping windows to save computational costs, and the standard self-attention computation only focuses on its results, thereby neglecting the useful information across channels and the rich spatial structural information generated in the intermediate process. Channel attention and spatial attention have, respectively, brought significant improvements to various downstream visual tasks in terms of extracting feature dependency and spatial structure relationships, but the synergistic relationship between channel and spatial attention has not been fully explored yet.To address these issues, we propose a novel model. Synergistic Alternating Aggregation Transformer (SAAT), which can better utilize the potential information of features. In SAAT, we introduce the Efficient Channel & Window Synergistic Attention Group (CWSAG) and the Spatial & Window Synergistic Attention Group (SWSAG). On the one hand, CWSAG combines efficient channel attention with shifted window attention, enhancing non-local feature fusion, and producing more visually appealing results. On the other hand, SWSAG leverages spatial attention to capture rich structured feature information, thereby enabling SAAT to more effectively extract structural features.Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of SAAT in the field of super-resolution. SAAT achieves performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) under the same quantity of parameters.

Abstract: Complex scenes present significant challenges for predicting human behaviour due to the abundance of interaction information, such as human-human and humanenvironment interactions. These factors complicate the analysis and understanding of human behaviour, thereby increasing the uncertainty in forecasting human motions. Existing motion prediction methods thus struggle in these complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose an effective method for human motion forecasting in interactive scenes. To achieve a comprehensive representation of interactions, we design a hierarchical interaction feature representation so that high-level features capture the overall context of the interactions, while low-level features focus on fine-grained details. Besides, we propose a coarse-to-fine interaction reasoning module that leverages both spatial and frequency perspectives to efficiently utilize hierarchical features, thereby enhancing the accuracy of motion predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across four public datasets. Code will be released when this paper is published.

<title>CoLa: Chinese Character Decomposition with Compositional Latent Components</title>

Abstract: Humans can decompose Chinese characters into compositional components and recombine them to recognize unseen characters. This reflects two cognitive principles: Compositionality, the idea that complex concepts are built on simpler parts; and Learning-to-learn, the ability to learn strategies for decomposing and recombining components to form new concepts. These principles provide inductive biases that support efficient generalization. They are critical to Chinese character recognition (CCR) in solving the zero-shot problem, which results from the common long-tail distribution of Chinese character datasets. Existing methods have made substantial progress in modeling compositionality via predefined radical or stroke decomposition. However, they often ignore the learning-to-learn capability, limiting their ability to generalize beyond human-defined schemes. Inspired by these principles, we propose a deep latent variable model that learns Compositional Latent components of Chinese characters (CoLa) without relying on human-defined decomposition schemes. Recognition and matching can be performed by comparing compositional latent components in the latent space, enabling zero-shot character recognition. The experiments illustrate that CoLa outperforms previous methods in both character the radical zero-shot CCR. Visualization indicates that the learned components can reflect the structure of characters in an interpretable way. Moreover, despite being trained on historical documents, CoLa can analyze components of oracle bone characters, highlighting its cross-dataset generalization ability.

arXiv:2506.03799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first study on adapting the visual in-context learning (V-ICL) paradigm to optical character recognition tasks, specifically focusing on text removal and segmentation. Most existing V-ICL generalists employ a reasoning-as-reconstruction approach: they turn to using a straightforward image-label compositor as the prompt and query input, and then masking the query label to generate the desired output. This direct prompt confines the model to a challenging single-step reasoning process. To address this, we propose a task-chaining compositor in the form of image-removal-segmentation, providing an enhanced prompt that elicits reasoning with enriched intermediates. Additionally, we introduce context-aware aggregation, integrating the chained prompt pattern into the latent query representation, thereby strengthening the model's in-context reasoning. We also consider the issue of visual heterogeneity, which complicates the selection of homogeneous demonstrations in text recognition. Accordingly, this is effectively addressed through a simple self-prompting strategy, preventing the model's in-context learnability from devolving into specialist-like, context-free inference. Collectively, these insights culminate in our ConText model, which achieves new state-of-the-art across both in- and out-of-domain benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/Ferenas/ConText.

Abstract: Automatically estimating animal poses from videos is important for studying animal behaviors. Existing methods do not perform reliably since they are trained on datasets that are not comprehensive enough to capture all necessary animal behaviors. However, it is very challenging to collect such datasets due to the large variations in animal morphology. In this paper, we propose an animal pose labeling pipeline that follows a different strategy, i.e. test time optimization. Given a video, we fine-tune a lightweight appearance embedding inside a pre-trained general-purpose point tracker on a sparse set of annotated frames. These annotations can be obtained from human labelers or off-the-shelf pose detectors. The fine-tuned model is then applied to the rest of the frames for automatic labeling. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance at a reasonable annotation cost. We believe our pipeline offers a valuable tool for the automatic quantification of animal behavior.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints is a long-standing challenge with wide applications. Recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian sparse-view reconstruction methods provide an efficient solution for real-time novel view synthesis by leveraging geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view datasets and computing 3D Gaussian centers via back-projection. Despite offering strong geometric cues, both feed-forward multi-view depth estimation and flow-depth joint estimation face key limitations: the former suffers from mislocation and artifact issues in low-texture or repetitive regions, while the latter is prone to local noise and global inconsistency due to unreliable matches when ground-truth flow supervision is unavailable. To overcome this, we propose JointSplat, a unified framework that leverages the complementarity between optical flow and depth via a novel probabilistic optimization mechanism. Specifically, this pixel-level mechanism scales the information fusion between depth and flow based on the matching probability of optical flow during training. Building upon the above mechanism, we further propose a novel multi-view depth-consistency loss to leverage the reliability of supervision while suppressing misleading gradients in uncertain areas. Evaluated on RealEstate10K and ACID, JointSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed probabilistic joint flow-depth optimization approach for high-fidelity sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Video transformer models require huge amounts of compute resources due to the spatio-temporal scaling of the input. Tackling this, recent methods have proposed to drop or merge tokens for image models, whether randomly or via learned methods. Merging tokens has many benefits: it can be plugged into any vision transformer, does not require model re-training, and it propagates information that would otherwise be dropped through the model. Before now, video token merging has not been evaluated on temporally complex datasets for video understanding. In this work, we explore training-free token merging for video to provide comprehensive experiments and find best practices across four video transformers on three datasets that exhibit coarse and fine-grained action recognition. Our results showcase the benefits of video token merging with a speedup of around $2.5$X while maintaining accuracy (avg. $-0.55\%$ for ViViT).

<title>Joint Video Enhancement with Deblurring, Super-Resolution, and Frame Interpolation Network</title>

Abstract: Video quality is often severely degraded by multiple factors rather than a single factor. These low-quality videos can be restored to high-quality videos by sequentially performing appropriate video enhancement techniques. However, the sequential approach was inefficient and sub-optimal because most video enhancement approaches were designed without taking into account that multiple factors together degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose a new joint video enhancement method that mitigates multiple degradation factors simultaneously by resolving an integrated enhancement problem. Our proposed network, named DSFN, directly produces a high-resolution, high-frame-rate, and clear video from a low-resolution, low-frame-rate, and blurry video. In the DSFN, low-resolution and blurry input frames are enhanced by a joint deblurring and super-resolution (JDSR) module. Meanwhile, intermediate frames between input adjacent frames are interpolated by a triple-frame-based frame interpolation (TFBFI) module. The proper combination of the proposed modules of DSFN can achieve superior performance on the joint video enhancement task. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other sequential state-of-the-art techniques on public datasets with a smaller network size and faster processing time.

Abstract: Event-based sensors offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based cameras, especially in scenarios involving rapid motion or challenging lighting conditions. However, event data frequently suffers from considerable noise, negatively impacting the performance and robustness of deep learning models. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by applying filtering algorithms to the event stream, but this may also remove some of relevant data. In this paper, we propose a novel noise-injection training methodology designed to enhance the neural networks robustness against varying levels of event noise. Our approach introduces controlled noise directly into the training data, enabling models to learn noise-resilient representations. We have conducted extensive evaluations of the proposed method using multiple benchmark datasets (N-Caltech101, N-Cars, and Mini N-ImageNet) and various network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformers, Spiking Neural Networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks. Experimental results show that our noise-injection training strategy achieves stable performance over a range of noise intensities, consistently outperforms event-filtering techniques, and achieves the highest average classification accuracy, making it a viable alternative to traditional event-data filtering methods in an object classification system.

<title>Multiple Stochastic Prompt Tuning for Practical Cross-Domain Few Shot Learning</title>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a practical cross-domain few-shot learning (pCDFSL) task, where a large-scale pre-trained model like CLIP can be easily deployed on a target dataset. The goal is to simultaneously classify all unseen classes under extreme domain shifts, by utilizing only a few labeled samples per class. The pCDFSL paradigm is source-free and moves beyond artificially created episodic training and testing regimes followed by existing CDFSL frameworks, making it more challenging and relevant to real-world applications. Towards that goal, we propose a novel framework, termed MIST (MultIple STochastic Prompt tuning), where multiple stochastic prompts are utilized to handle significant domain and semantic shifts. Specifically, multiple prompts are learnt for each class, effectively capturing multiple peaks in the input data. Furthermore, instead of representing the weights of the multiple prompts as point-estimates, we model them as learnable Gaussian distributions with two different strategies, encouraging an efficient exploration of the prompt parameter space, which mitigate overfitting due to the few labeled training samples. Extensive experiments and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on four CDFSL benchmarks adapted to this setting, show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<title>Vision Remember: Alleviating Visual Forgetting in Efficient MLLM with Vision Feature Resample</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study the Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model. Redundant vision tokens consume a significant amount of computational memory and resources. Therefore, many previous works compress them in the Vision Projector to reduce the number of vision tokens. However, simply compressing in the Vision Projector can lead to the loss of visual information, especially for tasks that rely on fine-grained spatial relationships, such as OCR and Chart \& Table Understanding. To address this problem, we propose Vision Remember, which is inserted between the LLM decoder layers to allow vision tokens to re-memorize vision features. Specifically, we retain multi-level vision features and resample them with the vision tokens that have interacted with the text token. During the resampling process, each vision token only attends to a local region in vision features, which is referred to as saliency-enhancing local attention. Saliency-enhancing local attention not only improves computational efficiency but also captures more fine-grained contextual information and spatial relationships within the region. Comprehensive experiments on multiple visual understanding benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method when combined with various Efficient Vision Projectors, showing performance gains without sacrificing efficiency. Based on Vision Remember, LLaVA-VR with only 2B parameters is also superior to previous representative MLLMs such as Tokenpacker-HD-7B and DeepSeek-VL-7B.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding, yet their susceptibility to perturbations poses a significant threat to their reliability in real-world applications. Despite often being imperceptible to humans, these perturbations can drastically alter model outputs, leading to erroneous interpretations and decisions. This paper introduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can effectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding minimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its latent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP cumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input data. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy images reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach to neutralize the adversarial effect. Subsequently, a pretrained diffusion model is employed to denoise the stabilized image, recovering a clean representation suitable for the VLMs to produce an output. Through extensive experiments across six datasets with three VLMs under varying attack strengths in three task scenarios, we show that DiffCAP consistently outperforms existing defense techniques by a substantial margin. Notably, DiffCAP significantly reduces both hyperparameter tuning complexity and the required diffusion time, thereby accelerating the denoising process. Equipped with strong theoretical and empirical support, DiffCAP provides a robust and practical solution for securely deploying VLMs in adversarial environments.

<title>Average Calibration Losses for Reliable Uncertainty in Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation are often overconfident, compromising both reliability and clinical utility. In this work, we propose differentiable formulations of marginal L1 Average Calibration Error (mL1-ACE) as an auxiliary loss that can be computed on a per-image basis. We compare both hard- and soft-binning approaches to directly improve pixel-wise calibration. Our experiments on four datasets (ACDC, AMOS, KiTS, BraTS) demonstrate that incorporating mL1-ACE significantly reduces calibration errors, particularly Average Calibration Error (ACE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), while largely maintaining high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs). We find that the soft-binned variant yields the greatest improvements in calibration, over the Dice plus cross-entropy loss baseline, but often compromises segmentation performance, with hard-binned mL1-ACE maintaining segmentation performance, albeit with weaker calibration improvement. To gain further insight into calibration performance and its variability across an imaging dataset, we introduce dataset reliability histograms, an aggregation of per-image reliability diagrams. The resulting analysis highlights improved alignment between predicted confidences and true accuracies. Overall, our approach not only enhances the trustworthiness of segmentation predictions but also shows potential for safer integration of deep learning methods into clinical workflows. We share our code here: https://github.com/cai4cai/Average-Calibration-Losses

Abstract: Complete blood cell detection holds significant value in clinical diagnostics. Conventional manual microscopy methods suffer from time inefficiency and diagnostic inaccuracies. Existing automated detection approaches remain constrained by high deployment costs and suboptimal accuracy. While deep learning has introduced powerful paradigms to this field, persistent challenges in detecting overlapping cells and multi-scale objects hinder practical deployment. This study proposes the multi-scale YOLO (MS-YOLO), a blood cell detection model based on the YOLOv11 framework, incorporating three key architectural innovations to enhance detection performance. Specifically, the multi-scale dilated residual module (MS-DRM) replaces the original C3K2 modules to improve multi-scale discriminability; the dynamic cross-path feature enhancement module (DCFEM) enables the fusion of hierarchical features from the backbone with aggregated features from the neck to enhance feature representations; and the light adaptive-weight downsampling module (LADS) improves feature downsampling through adaptive spatial weighting while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate that MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale objects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of 97.4% that outperforms existing models. Further validation on the supplementary WBCDD dataset confirms its robust generalization capability. Additionally, with a lightweight architecture and real-time inference efficiency, MS-YOLO meets clinical deployment requirements, providing reliable technical support for standardized blood pathology assessment.

Abstract: AI-generated images have reached a quality level at which humans are incapable of reliably distinguishing them from real images. To counteract the inherent risk of fraud and disinformation, the detection of AI-generated images is a pressing challenge and an active research topic. While many of the presented methods claim to achieve high detection accuracy, they are usually evaluated under idealized conditions. In particular, the adversarial robustness is often neglected, potentially due to a lack of awareness or the substantial effort required to conduct a comprehensive robustness analysis. In this work, we tackle this problem by providing a simpler means to assess the robustness of AI-generated image detectors. We present RAID (Robust evaluation of AI-generated image Detectors), a dataset of 72k diverse and highly transferable adversarial examples. The dataset is created by running attacks against an ensemble of seven state-of-the-art detectors and images generated by four different text-to-image models. Extensive experiments show that our methodology generates adversarial images that transfer with a high success rate to unseen detectors, which can be used to quickly provide an approximate yet still reliable estimate of a detector's adversarial robustnessOur findings indicate that current state-of-the-art AI-generated image detectors can be easily deceived by adversarial examples, highlighting the critical need for the development of more robust methods. We release our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/aimagelab/RAID and evaluation code at https://github.com/pralab/RAID.

Abstract: Recent advances in few-shot adaptation for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have greatly expanded their ability to generalize across tasks using only a few labeled examples. However, existing approaches primarily build upon the strong zero-shot priors of these models by leveraging carefully designed, task-specific prompts. This dependence on predefined class names can restrict their applicability, especially in scenarios where exact class names are unavailable or difficult to specify. To address this limitation, we introduce vocabulary-free few-shot learning for VLMs, a setting where target class instances - that is, images - are available but their corresponding names are not. We propose Similarity Mapping (SiM), a simple yet effective baseline that classifies target instances solely based on similarity scores with a set of generic prompts (textual or visual), eliminating the need for carefully handcrafted prompts. Although conceptually straightforward, SiM demonstrates strong performance, operates with high computational efficiency (learning the mapping typically takes less than one second), and provides interpretability by linking target classes to generic prompts. We believe that our approach could serve as an important baseline for future research in vocabulary-free few-shot learning. Code is available at https://github.com/MaxZanella/vocabulary-free-FSL.

<title>Rex-Thinker: Grounded Object Referring via Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04034</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object referring aims to detect all objects in an image that match a given natural language description. We argue that a robust object referring model should be grounded, meaning its predictions should be both explainable and faithful to the visual content. Specifically, it should satisfy two key properties: 1) Verifiable, by producing interpretable reasoning that justifies its predictions and clearly links them to visual evidence; and 2) Trustworthy, by learning to abstain when no object in the image satisfies the given expression. However, most methods treat referring as a direct bounding box prediction task, offering limited interpretability and struggling to reject expressions with no matching object. In this work, we propose Rex-Thinker, a model that formulates object referring as an explicit CoT reasoning task. Given a referring expression, we first identify all candidate object instances corresponding to the referred object category. Rex-Thinker then performs step-by-step reasoning over each candidate to assess whether it matches the given expression, before making a final prediction. To support this paradigm, we construct a large-scale CoT-style referring dataset named HumanRef-CoT by prompting GPT-4o on the HumanRef dataset. Each reasoning trace follows a structured planning, action, and summarization format, enabling the model to learn decomposed, interpretable reasoning over object candidates. We then train Rex-Thinker in two stages: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to teach the model how to perform structured reasoning, followed by GRPO-based RL learning to improve accuracy and generalization. Experiments show that our approach outperforms standard baselines in both precision and interpretability on in-domain evaluation, while also demonstrating improved ability to reject hallucinated outputs and strong generalization in out-of-domain settings.

Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across multiple tasks. However, their trustworthiness is often challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO), which achieves enhanced modality alignment than existing human preference alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image, instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO, e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9% on Object-HalBench and 49.8% on MM-HalBench.

Abstract: Monitoring aerial objects is crucial for security, wildlife conservation, and environmental studies. Traditional RGB-based approaches struggle with challenges such as scale variations, motion blur, and high-speed object movements, especially for small flying entities like insects and drones. In this work, we explore the potential of event-based vision for detecting and recognizing flying objects, in particular animals that may not follow short and long-term predictable patters. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution, low latency, and robustness to motion blur, making them well-suited for this task. We introduce EV-Flying, an event-based dataset of flying objects, comprising manually annotated birds, insects and drones with spatio-temporal bounding boxes and track identities. To effectively process the asynchronous event streams, we employ a point-based approach leveraging lightweight architectures inspired by PointNet. Our study investigates the classification of flying objects using point cloud-based event representations. The proposed dataset and methodology pave the way for more efficient and reliable aerial object recognition in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In contrast to single-image deblurring, video deblurring has the advantage that neighbor frames can be utilized to deblur a target frame. However, existing video deblurring algorithms often fail to properly employ the neighbor frames, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a deconvolution and aggregation network (DAN) for video deblurring that utilizes the information of neighbor frames well. In DAN, both deconvolution and aggregation strategies are achieved through three sub-networks: the preprocessing network (PPN) and the alignment-based deconvolution network (ABDN) for the deconvolution scheme; the frame aggregation network (FAN) for the aggregation scheme. In the deconvolution part, blurry inputs are first preprocessed by the PPN with non-local operations. Then, the output frames from the PPN are deblurred by the ABDN based on the frame alignment. In the FAN, these deblurred frames from the deconvolution part are combined into a latent frame according to reliability maps which infer pixel-wise sharpness. The proper combination of three sub-networks can achieve favorable performance on video deblurring by using the neighbor frames suitably. In experiments, the proposed DAN was demonstrated to be superior to existing state-of-the-art methods through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the public datasets.

Abstract: We introduce GlobalBuildingAtlas, a publicly available dataset providing global and complete coverage of building polygons, heights and Level of Detail 1 (LoD1) 3D building models. This is the first open dataset to offer high quality, consistent, and complete building data in 2D and 3D form at the individual building level on a global scale. Towards this dataset, we developed machine learning-based pipelines to derive building polygons and heights (called GBA.Height) from global PlanetScope satellite data, respectively. Also a quality-based fusion strategy was employed to generate higher-quality polygons (called GBA.Polygon) based on existing open building polygons, including our own derived one. With more than 2.75 billion buildings worldwide, GBA.Polygon surpasses the most comprehensive database to date by more than 1 billion buildings. GBA.Height offers the most detailed and accurate global 3D building height maps to date, achieving a spatial resolution of 3x3 meters-30 times finer than previous global products (90 m), enabling a high-resolution and reliable analysis of building volumes at both local and global scales. Finally, we generated a global LoD1 building model (called GBA.LoD1) from the resulting GBA.Polygon and GBA.Height. GBA.LoD1 represents the first complete global LoD1 building models, including 2.68 billion building instances with predicted heights, i.e., with a height completeness of more than 97%, achieving RMSEs ranging from 1.5 m to 8.9 m across different continents. With its height accuracy, comprehensive global coverage and rich spatial details, GlobalBuildingAltas offers novel insights on the status quo of global buildings, which unlocks unprecedented geospatial analysis possibilities, as showcased by a better illustration of where people live and a more comprehensive monitoring of the progress on the 11th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity 3D surface reconstruction while preserving fine details remains challenging, especially in the presence of materials with complex reflectance properties and without a dense-view setup. In this paper, we introduce a versatile framework that incorporates multi-view normal and optionally reflectance maps into radiance-based surface reconstruction. Our approach employs a pixel-wise joint re-parametrization of reflectance and surface normals, representing them as a vector of radiances under simulated, varying illumination. This formulation enables seamless incorporation into standard surface reconstruction pipelines, such as traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) frameworks or modern neural volume rendering (NVR) ones. Combined with the latter, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) benchmark datasets, including DiLiGenT-MV, LUCES-MV and Skoltech3D. In particular, our method excels in reconstructing fine-grained details and handling challenging visibility conditions. The present paper is an extended version of the earlier conference paper by Brument et al. (in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2024), featuring an accelerated and more robust algorithm as well as a broader empirical evaluation.

<title>Contour Errors: An Ego-Centric Metric for Reliable 3D Multi-Object Tracking</title>

Abstract: Finding reliable matches is essential in multi-object tracking to ensure the accuracy and reliability of perception systems in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles. Effective matching mitigates perception errors, enhancing object identification and tracking for improved performance and safety. However, traditional metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Center Point Distances (CPDs), which are effective in 2D image planes, often fail to find critical matches in complex 3D scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce Contour Errors (CEs), an ego or object-centric metric for identifying matches of interest in tracking scenarios from a functional perspective. By comparing bounding boxes in the ego vehicle's frame, contour errors provide a more functionally relevant assessment of object matches. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that contour errors improve the reliability of matches over the state-of-the-art 2D IoU and CPD metrics in tracking-by-detection methods. In 3D car tracking, our results show that Contour Errors reduce functional failures (FPs/FNs) by 80% at close ranges and 60% at far ranges compared to IoU in the evaluation stage.

<title>UniCUE: Unified Recognition and Generation Framework for Chinese Cued Speech Video-to-Speech Generation</title>

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) enhances lipreading through hand coding, providing precise speech perception support for the hearing-impaired. CS Video-to-Speech generation (CSV2S) task aims to convert the CS visual expressions (CS videos) of hearing-impaired individuals into comprehensible speech signals. Direct generation of speech from CS video (called single CSV2S) yields poor performance due to insufficient CS data. Current research mostly focuses on CS Recognition (CSR), which convert video content into linguistic text. Based on this, one straightforward way of CSV2S is to combine CSR with a Text-to-Speech system. This combined architecture relies on text as an intermediate medium for stepwise cross-modal alignment, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and video dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that directly generates speech from CS videos without relying on intermediate text. Building upon this, we propose UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S, whose core innovation lies in the integration of the CSR task that provides fine-grained visual-semantic information to facilitate speech generation from CS videos. More precisely, (1) a novel fine-grained semantic alignment pool to ensure precise mapping between visual features and speech contents; (2) a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge cross-task representations, ensuring seamless compatibility between two distinct tasks (i.e., CSV2S and CSR); (3) a pose-aware visual processor is introduced to enhance fine-grained spatiotemporal correlations between lip and hand movements in CS video. Experiments on our new established Chinese CS dataset (14 cuers1: 8 hearing-impaired and 6 normal-hearing) show that our UniCUE significantly reduces Word Error Rate by 78.3% and improves lip-speech synchronization by 32% compared to the single CSV2S.

<title>MMR-V: What's Left Unsaid? A Benchmark for Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04141</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequential structure of videos poses a challenge to the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to locate multi-frame evidence and conduct multimodal reasoning. However, existing video benchmarks mainly focus on understanding tasks, which only require models to match frames mentioned in the question (hereafter referred to as "question frame") and perceive a few adjacent frames. To address this gap, we propose MMR-V: A Benchmark for Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos. The benchmark is characterized by the following features. (1) Long-range, multi-frame reasoning: Models are required to infer and analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame. (2) Beyond perception: Questions cannot be answered through direct perception alone but require reasoning over hidden information. (3) Reliability: All tasks are manually annotated, referencing extensive real-world user understanding to align with common perceptions. (4) Confusability: Carefully designed distractor annotation strategies to reduce model shortcuts. MMR-V consists of 317 videos and 1,257 tasks. Our experiments reveal that current models still struggle with multi-modal reasoning; even the best-performing model, o4-mini, achieves only 52.5% accuracy. Additionally, current reasoning enhancement strategies (Chain-of-Thought and scaling test-time compute) bring limited gains. Further analysis indicates that the CoT demanded for multi-modal reasoning differs from it in textual reasoning, which partly explains the limited performance gains. We hope that MMR-V can inspire further research into enhancing multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is a very important task in video surveillance systems such as tracking people, finding people in public places, or analysing customer behavior in supermarkets. Although there have been many works to solve this problem, there are still remaining challenges such as large-scale datasets, imbalanced data, viewpoint, fine grained data (attributes), the Local Features are not employed at semantic level in online stage of Re-ID task, furthermore, the imbalanced data problem of attributes are not taken into consideration. This paper has proposed a Unified Re-ID system consisted of three main modules such as Pedestrian Attribute Ontology (PAO), Local Multi-task DCNN (Local MDCNN), Imbalance Data Solver (IDS). The new main point of our Re-ID system is the power of mutual support of PAO, Local MDCNN and IDS to exploit the inner-group correlations of attributes and pre-filter the mismatch candidates from Gallery set based on semantic information as Fashion Attributes and Facial Attributes, to solve the imbalanced data of attributes without adjusting network architecture and data augmentation. We experimented on the well-known Market1501 dataset. The experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our Re-ID system and it could achieve the higher performance on Market1501 dataset in comparison to some state-of-the-art Re-ID methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit. Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for complex, multi-step instructions. Codes are available at https://github.com/YujiaHu1109/IEAP.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has enabled various applications in 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis due to its efficient rendering capabilities. However, 3DGS demands relatively significant GPU memory, limiting its use on devices with restricted computational resources. Previous approaches have focused on pruning less important Gaussians, effectively compressing 3DGS but often requiring a fine-tuning stage and lacking adaptability for the specific memory needs of different devices. In this work, we present an elastic inference method for 3DGS. Given an input for the desired model size, our method selects and transforms a subset of Gaussians, achieving substantial rendering performance without additional fine-tuning. We introduce a tiny learnable module that controls Gaussian selection based on the input percentage, along with a transformation module that adjusts the selected Gaussians to complement the performance of the reduced model. Comprehensive experiments on ZipNeRF, MipNeRF and Tanks\&amp;Temples scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://flexgs.github.io.

<title>Language-Image Alignment with Fixed Text Encoders</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04209</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the most dominant approach to establishing language-image alignment is to pre-train text and image encoders jointly through contrastive learning, such as CLIP and its variants. In this work, we question whether such a costly joint training is necessary. In particular, we investigate if a pre-trained fixed large language model (LLM) offers a good enough text encoder to guide visual representation learning. That is, we propose to learn Language-Image alignment with a Fixed Text encoder (LIFT) from an LLM by training only the image encoder. Somewhat surprisingly, through comprehensive benchmarking and ablation studies, we find that this much simplified framework LIFT is highly effective and it outperforms CLIP in most scenarios that involve compositional understanding and long captions, while achieving considerable gains in computational efficiency. Our work takes a first step towards systematically exploring how text embeddings from LLMs can guide visual learning and suggests an alternative design choice for learning language-aligned visual representations.

Abstract: Object detectors often suffer a decrease in performance due to the large domain gap between the training data (source domain) and real-world data (target domain). Diffusion-based generative models have shown remarkable abilities in generating high-quality and diverse images, suggesting their potential for extracting valuable feature from various domains. To effectively leverage the cross-domain feature representation of diffusion models, in this paper, we train a detector with frozen-weight diffusion model on the source domain, then employ it as a teacher model to generate pseudo labels on the unlabeled target domain, which are used to guide the supervised learning of the student model on the target domain. We refer to this approach as Diffusion Domain Teacher (DDT). By employing this straightforward yet potent framework, we significantly improve cross-domain object detection performance without compromising the inference speed. Our method achieves an average mAP improvement of 21.2% compared to the baseline on 6 datasets from three common cross-domain detection benchmarks (Cross-Camera, Syn2Real, Real2Artistic}, surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average of 5.7% mAP. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently brings improvements even in more powerful and complex models, highlighting broadly applicable and effective domain adaptation capability of our DDT.

<title>FullDiT2: Efficient In-Context Conditioning for Video Diffusion Transformers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained and efficient controllability on video diffusion transformers has raised increasing desires for the applicability. Recently, In-context Conditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video generation, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context conditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token sequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite their effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task complexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study the efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video generation framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key sources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within context condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent interactions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we propose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general controllability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates from two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2 leverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important context tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention. Additionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize redundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive experiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks demonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3 times speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal degradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

Abstract: Generating accurate sounds for complex audio-visual scenes is challenging, especially in the presence of multiple objects and sound sources. In this paper, we propose an {\em interactive object-aware audio generation} model that grounds sound generation in user-selected visual objects within images. Our method integrates object-centric learning into a conditional latent diffusion model, which learns to associate image regions with their corresponding sounds through multi-modal attention. At test time, our model employs image segmentation to allow users to interactively generate sounds at the {\em object} level. We theoretically validate that our attention mechanism functionally approximates test-time segmentation masks, ensuring the generated audio aligns with selected objects. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model outperforms baselines, achieving better alignment between objects and their associated sounds.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have sparked interest in generative video editing tasks. Previous methods often rely on task-specific architectures (e.g., additional adapter modules) or dedicated customizations (e.g., DDIM inversion), which limit the integration of versatile editing conditions and the unification of various editing tasks. In this paper, we introduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective framework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an in-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of various video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens, the noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary according to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key insight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token sequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT, thereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless, direct task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe token collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and diverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce task-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and condition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different editing tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video editing tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens "in context", and support flexible task composition. To validate our method, we construct a unified video editing benchmark containing six representative video editing tasks. Results demonstrate that our unified approach achieves superior performance on each task and exhibits emergent task composition abilities.

Abstract: Unlocking spatial reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is crucial for enabling intelligent interaction with 3D environments. While prior efforts often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask: can LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs (e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories, generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM (Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively bridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support future research.

Abstract: We introduce Oxford Day-and-Night, a large-scale, egocentric dataset for novel view synthesis (NVS) and visual relocalisation under challenging lighting conditions. Existing datasets often lack crucial combinations of features such as ground-truth 3D geometry, wide-ranging lighting variation, and full 6DoF motion. Oxford Day-and-Night addresses these gaps by leveraging Meta ARIA glasses to capture egocentric video and applying multi-session SLAM to estimate camera poses, reconstruct 3D point clouds, and align sequences captured under varying lighting conditions, including both day and night. The dataset spans over 30 $\mathrm{km}$ of recorded trajectories and covers an area of 40,000 $\mathrm{m}^2$, offering a rich foundation for egocentric 3D vision research. It supports two core benchmarks, NVS and relocalisation, providing a unique platform for evaluating models in realistic and diverse environments.

Abstract: Real-world applications like video gaming and virtual reality often demand the ability to model 3D scenes that users can explore along custom camera trajectories. While significant progress has been made in generating 3D objects from text or images, creating long-range, 3D-consistent, explorable 3D scenes remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we present Voyager, a novel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud sequences from a single image with user-defined camera path. Unlike existing approaches, Voyager achieves end-to-end scene generation and reconstruction with inherent consistency across frames, eliminating the need for 3D reconstruction pipelines (e.g., structure-from-motion or multi-view stereo). Our method integrates three key components: 1) World-Consistent Video Diffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth video sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global coherence 2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point culling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for iterative scene extension with context-aware consistency, and 3) Scalable Data Engine: A video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation and metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse training data curation without manual 3D annotations. Collectively, these designs result in a clear improvement over existing methods in visual quality and geometric accuracy, with versatile applications.

Abstract: We present LayerFlow, a unified solution for layer-aware video generation. Given per-layer prompts, LayerFlow generates videos for the transparent foreground, clean background, and blended scene. It also supports versatile variants like decomposing a blended video or generating the background for the given foreground and vice versa. Starting from a text-to-video diffusion transformer, we organize the videos for different layers as sub-clips, and leverage layer embeddings to distinguish each clip and the corresponding layer-wise prompts. In this way, we seamlessly support the aforementioned variants in one unified framework. For the lack of high-quality layer-wise training videos, we design a multi-stage training strategy to accommodate static images with high-quality layer annotations. Specifically, we first train the model with low-quality video data. Then, we tune a motion LoRA to make the model compatible with static frames. Afterward, we train the content LoRA on the mixture of image data with high-quality layered images along with copy-pasted video data. During inference, we remove the motion LoRA thus generating smooth videos with desired layers.

<title>mRAG: Elucidating the Design Space of Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: CubeSats offer a low-cost platform for space research, particularly for Earth observation. However, their resource-constrained nature and being in space, challenge the flexibility and complexity of the deployed image processing pipelines and their orchestration. This paper introduces two novel systems, DIPP and DISH, to address these challenges. DIPP is a modular and configurable image processing pipeline framework that allows for adaptability to changing mission goals even after deployment, while preserving robustness. DISH is a domain-specific language (DSL) and runtime system designed to schedule complex imaging workloads on low-power and memory-constrained processors.
  Our experiments demonstrate that DIPP's decomposition of the processing pipelines adds negligible overhead, while significantly reducing the network requirements of updating pipelines and being robust against erroneous module uploads. Furthermore, we compare DISH to Lua, a general purpose scripting language, and demonstrate its comparable expressiveness and lower memory requirement.

Abstract: Deep learning models frequently encounter feature uncertainty in diverse learning scenarios, significantly impacting their performance and reliability. This challenge is particularly complex in multi-modal scenarios, where models must integrate information from different sources with inherent uncertainties. We propose Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Learning (DUAL), a unified framework that effectively handles feature uncertainty in both single-modal and multi-modal scenarios. DUAL introduces three key innovations: Dynamic Feature Uncertainty Modeling, which continuously refines uncertainty estimates through joint consideration of feature characteristics and learning dynamics; Adaptive Distribution-Aware Modulation, which maintains balanced feature distributions through dynamic sample influence adjustment; and Uncertainty-aware Cross-Modal Relationship Learning, which explicitly models uncertainties in cross-modal interactions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate DUAL's effectiveness across multiple domains: in computer vision tasks, it achieves substantial improvements of 7.1% accuracy on CIFAR-10, 6.5% accuracy on CIFAR-100, and 2.3% accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet; in multi-modal learning, it demonstrates consistent gains of 4.1% accuracy on CMU-MOSEI and 2.8% accuracy on CMU-MOSI for sentiment analysis, while achieving 1.4% accuracy improvements on MISR. The code will be available on GitHub soon.

<title>Super-temporal-resolution Photoacoustic Imaging with Dynamic Reconstruction through Implicit Neural Representation in Sparse-view</title>

Abstract: Dynamic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is an important imaging technique for monitoring physiological processes, capable of providing high-contrast images of optical absorption at much greater depths than traditional optical imaging methods. However, practical instrumentation and geometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the imaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data, produce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not consider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution is crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by the low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser technology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by characterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to improve dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and enhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input. Specifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as implicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the network are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the need for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong implicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit regularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms traditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions, effectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6% localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists' acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of 74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer screening workflows in clinical practice.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation holds significant potential to reduce radiologists' workload and enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, generating precise and clinically meaningful reports from chest radiographs remains challenging due to the complexity of medical language and the need for contextual understanding. Existing models often struggle with maintaining both accuracy and contextual relevance. In this paper, we present LLaMA-XR, a novel framework that integrates LLaMA 3.1 with DenseNet-121-based image embeddings and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning. LLaMA-XR achieves improved coherence and clinical accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. This efficiency is driven by an optimization strategy that enhances parameter utilization and reduces memory overhead, enabling faster report generation with lower computational resource demands. Extensive experiments conducted on the IU X-ray benchmark dataset demonstrate that LLaMA-XR outperforms a range of state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves a ROUGE-L score of 0.433 and a METEOR score of 0.336, establishing new performance benchmarks in the domain. These results underscore LLaMA-XR's potential as an effective and efficient AI system for automated radiology reporting, offering enhanced clinical utility and reliability.

Abstract: Digitizing cultural heritage collections has become crucial for preservation of historical artifacts and enhancing their availability to the wider public. Galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM institutions) are actively digitizing their holdings and creates extensive digital collections. Those collections are often enriched with metadata describing items but not exactly their contents. The Jagiellonian Digital Library, standing as a good example of such an effort, offers datasets accessible through protocols like OAI-PMH. Despite these improvements, metadata completeness and standardization continue to pose substantial obstacles, limiting the searchability and potential connections between collections. To deal with these challenges, we explore an integrated methodology of computer vision (CV), artificial intelligence (AI), and semantic web technologies to enrich metadata and construct knowledge graphs for digitized manuscripts and incunabula.

<title>Dc-EEMF: Pushing depth-of-field limit of photoacoustic microscopy via decision-level constrained learning</title>

Abstract: Photoacoustic microscopy holds the potential to measure biomarkers' structural and functional status without labels, which significantly aids in comprehending pathophysiological conditions in biomedical research. However, conventional optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is hindered by a limited depth-of-field (DoF) due to the narrow depth range focused on a Gaussian beam. Consequently, it fails to resolve sufficient details in the depth direction. Herein, we propose a decision-level constrained end-to-end multi-focus image fusion (Dc-EEMF) to push DoF limit of PAM. The DC-EEMF method is a lightweight siamese network that incorporates an artifact-resistant channel-wise spatial frequency as its feature fusion rule. The meticulously crafted U-Net-based perceptual loss function for decision-level focus properties in end-to-end fusion seamlessly integrates the complementary advantages of spatial domain and transform domain methods within Dc-EEMF. This approach can be trained end-to-end without necessitating post-processing procedures. Experimental results and numerical analyses collectively demonstrate our method's robust performance, achieving an impressive fusion result for PAM images without a substantial sacrifice in lateral resolution. The utilization of Dc-EEMF-powered PAM has the potential to serve as a practical tool in preclinical and clinical studies requiring extended DoF for various applications.

Abstract: Physics-driven artificial intelligence (PD-AI) reconstruction methods have emerged as the state-of-the-art for accelerating MRI scans, enabling higher spatial and temporal resolutions. However, the high resolution of these scans generates massive data volumes, leading to challenges in transmission, storage, and real-time processing. This is particularly pronounced in functional MRI, where hundreds of volumetric acquisitions further exacerbate these demands. Edge computing with FPGAs presents a promising solution for enabling PD-AI reconstruction near the MRI sensors, reducing data transfer and storage bottlenecks. However, this requires optimization of PD-AI models for hardware efficiency through quantization and bypassing traditional FFT-based approaches, which can be a limitation due to their computational demands. In this work, we propose a novel PD-AI computational MRI approach optimized for FPGA-based edge computing devices, leveraging 8-bit complex data quantization and eliminating redundant FFT/IFFT operations. Our results show that this strategy improves computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to conventional PD-AI methods, and outperforms standard clinical methods. Our approach presents an opportunity for high-resolution MRI reconstruction on resource-constrained devices, highlighting its potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Pathologists comprehensive evaluation of donor liver biopsies provides crucial information for accepting or discarding potential grafts. However, rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset. We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated and intelligent donor liver assessment research. Data and code are available at https://github.com/panliangrui/ACM_MM_2025.

Abstract: Retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Macular Hole (MH) significantly impact vision and affect millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial, as DR, a complication of diabetes, damages retinal blood vessels, potentially leading to blindness, while MH disrupts central vision, affecting tasks like reading and facial recognition. This paper employed two lightweight and efficient Convolution Neural Network architectures, MobileNet and NASNetMobile, for the classification of Normal, DR, and MH retinal images. The models were trained on the RFMiD dataset, consisting of 3,200 fundus images, after undergoing preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation. To address data scarcity, this study leveraged transfer learning and data augmentation techniques, enhancing model generalization and performance. The experimental results demonstrate that MobileNetV2 achieved the highest accuracy of 90.8%, outperforming NASNetMobile, which achieved 89.5% accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of CNNs in retinal disease classification, providing a foundation for AI-assisted ophthalmic diagnosis and early intervention.

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), a class of chronic wounds, affect ~750,000 individuals every year in the US alone and identifying non-healing DFUs that develop to chronic wounds early can drastically reduce treatment costs and minimize risks of amputation. There is therefore a pressing need for diagnostic tools that can detect non-healing DFUs early. We develop a low cost, multi-analyte 3D printed assays seamlessly integrated on swabs that can identify non-healing DFUs and a Wound Sensor iOS App - an innovative mobile application developed for the controlled acquisition and automated analysis of wound sensor data. By comparing both the original base image (before exposure to the wound) and the wound-exposed image, we developed automated computer vision techniques to compare density changes between the two assay images, which allow us to automatically determine the severity of the wound. The iOS app ensures accurate data collection and presents actionable insights, despite challenges such as variations in camera configurations and ambient conditions. The proposed integrated sensor and iOS app will allow healthcare professionals to monitor wound conditions real-time, track healing progress, and assess critical parameters related to wound care.

Abstract: Craniosynostosis is a medical condition that affects the growth of babies' heads, caused by an early fusion of cranial sutures. In recent decades, surgical treatments for craniosynostosis have significantly improved, leading to reduced invasiveness, faster recovery, and less blood loss. At Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), the main surgical treatment for patients diagnosed with sagittal craniosynostosis (SC) is spring assisted cranioplasty (SAC). This procedure involves a 15x15 mm2 osteotomy, where two springs are inserted to induce distraction. Despite the numerous advantages of this surgical technique for patients, the outcome remains unpredictable due to the lack of efficient preoperative planning tools. The surgeon's experience and the baby's age are currently relied upon to determine the osteotomy location and spring selection. Previous tools for predicting the surgical outcome of SC relied on finite element modeling (FEM), which involved computed tomography (CT) imaging and required engineering expertise and lengthy calculations. The main goal of this research is to develop a real-time prediction tool for the surgical outcome of patients, eliminating the need for CT scans to minimise radiation exposure during preoperative planning. The proposed methodology involves creating personalised synthetic skulls based on three-dimensional (3D) photographs, incorporating population average values of suture location, skull thickness, and soft tissue properties. A machine learning (ML) surrogate model is employed to achieve the desired surgical outcome. The resulting multi-output support vector regressor model achieves a R2 metric of 0.95 and MSE and MAE below 0.13. Furthermore, in the future, this model could not only simulate various surgical scenarios but also provide optimal parameters for achieving a maximum cranial index (CI).

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) is a prominent research topic in low-level computer vision, where deep learning technologies have played a significant role. The rapid progress in deep learning and its applications in VSR has led to a proliferation of tools and techniques in the literature. However, the usage of these methods is often not adequately explained, and decisions are primarily driven by quantitative improvements. Given the significance of VSR's potential influence across multiple domains, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the elements and deep learning methodologies employed in VSR research. This methodical analysis will facilitate the informed development of models tailored to specific application needs. In this paper, we present an overarching overview of deep learning-based video super-resolution models, investigating each component and discussing its implications. Furthermore, we provide a synopsis of key components and technologies employed by state-of-the-art and earlier VSR models. By elucidating the underlying methodologies and categorising them systematically, we identified trends, requirements, and challenges in the domain. As a first-of-its-kind survey of deep learning-based VSR models, this work also establishes a multi-level taxonomy to guide current and future VSR research, enhancing the maturation and interpretation of VSR practices for various practical applications.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Quantification of amyloid plaques (A), neurofibrillary tangles (T2), and neurodegeneration (N) using PET and MRI is critical for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and prognosis. Existing pipelines face limitations regarding processing time, variability in tracer types, and challenges in multimodal integration.
  METHODS: We developed petBrain, a novel end-to-end processing pipeline for amyloid-PET, tau-PET, and structural MRI. It leverages deep learning-based segmentation, standardized biomarker quantification (Centiloid, CenTauR, HAVAs), and simultaneous estimation of A, T2, and N biomarkers. The pipeline is implemented as a web-based platform, requiring no local computational infrastructure or specialized software knowledge.
  RESULTS: petBrain provides reliable and rapid biomarker quantification, with results comparable to existing pipelines for A and T2. It shows strong concordance with data processed in ADNI databases. The staging and quantification of A/T2/N by petBrain demonstrated good agreement with CSF/plasma biomarkers, clinical status, and cognitive performance.
  DISCUSSION: petBrain represents a powerful and openly accessible platform for standardized AD biomarker analysis, facilitating applications in clinical research.

Abstract: Automated interpretation of CT images-particularly localizing and describing abnormal findings across multi-plane and whole-body scans-remains a significant challenge in clinical radiology. This work aims to address this challenge through four key contributions: (i) On taxonomy, we collaborate with senior radiologists to propose a comprehensive hierarchical classification system, with 404 representative abnormal findings across all body regions; (ii) On data, we contribute a dataset containing over 14.5K CT images from multiple planes and all human body regions, and meticulously provide grounding annotations for over 19K abnormalities, each linked to the detailed description and cast into the taxonomy; (iii) On model development, we propose OminiAbnorm-CT, which can automatically ground and describe abnormal findings on multi-plane and whole-body CT images based on text queries, while also allowing flexible interaction through visual prompts; (iv) On benchmarks, we establish three representative evaluation tasks based on real clinical scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we show that OminiAbnorm-CT can significantly outperform existing methods on all the tasks and metrics.

Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is vital for maintaining the safety and longevity of civil infrastructure, yet current solutions remain constrained by cost, power consumption, scalability, and the complexity of data processing. Here, we present a diffractive vibration monitoring system, integrating a jointly optimized diffractive layer with a shallow neural network-based backend to remotely extract 3D structural vibration spectra, offering a low-power, cost-effective and scalable solution. This architecture eliminates the need for dense sensor arrays or extensive data acquisition; instead, it uses a spatially-optimized passive diffractive layer that encodes 3D structural displacements into modulated light, captured by a minimal number of detectors and decoded in real-time by shallow and low-power neural networks to reconstruct the 3D displacement spectra of structures. The diffractive system's efficacy was demonstrated both numerically and experimentally using millimeter-wave illumination on a laboratory-scale building model with a programmable shake table. Our system achieves more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over conventional optics or separately trained modules, establishing a foundation for high-throughput 3D monitoring of structures. Beyond SHM, the 3D vibration monitoring capabilities of this cost-effective and data-efficient framework establish a new computational sensing modality with potential applications in disaster resilience, aerospace diagnostics, and autonomous navigation, where energy efficiency, low latency, and high-throughput are critical.

Abstract: Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings. This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. When employing our robust CLIP encoders in multimodal retrieval tasks, we improve the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization.

Abstract: Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.

Abstract: As video-sharing platforms have grown over the past decade, child viewership has surged, increasing the need for precise detection of harmful content like violence or explicit scenes. Malicious users exploit moderation systems by embedding unsafe content in minimal frames to evade detection. While prior research has focused on visual cues and advanced such fine-grained detection, audio features remain underexplored. In this study, we embed audio cues with visual for fine-grained child harmful content detection and introduce SNIFR, a novel framework for effective alignment. SNIFR employs a transformer encoder for intra-modality interaction, followed by a cascaded cross-transformer for inter-modality alignment. Our approach achieves superior performance over unimodal and baseline fusion methods, setting a new state-of-the-art.

<title>Multi-Spectral Gaussian Splatting with Neural Color Representation</title>

Abstract: We present MS-Splatting -- a multi-spectral 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework that is able to generate multi-view consistent novel views from images of multiple, independent cameras with different spectral domains. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.
  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.
  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in integrating language-driven techniques into trajectory prediction. By leveraging their semantic and reasoning capabilities, LLMs are reshaping how autonomous systems perceive, model, and predict trajectories. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of this emerging field, categorizing recent work into five directions: (1) Trajectory prediction via language modeling paradigms, (2) Direct trajectory prediction with pretrained language models, (3) Language-guided scene understanding for trajectory prediction, (4) Language-driven data generation for trajectory prediction, (5) Language-based reasoning and interpretability for trajectory prediction. For each, we analyze representative methods, highlight core design choices, and identify open challenges. This survey bridges natural language processing and trajectory prediction, offering a unified perspective on how language can enrich trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Skin cancer is among the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases worldwide, with early detection being critical to patient outcomes. This work presents a hybrid machine and deep learning-based approach for classifying malignant and benign skin lesions using the SLICE-3D dataset from ISIC 2024, which comprises 401,059 cropped lesion images extracted from 3D Total Body Photography (TBP), emulating non-dermoscopic, smartphone-like conditions. Our method combines vision transformers (EVA02) and our designed convolutional ViT hybrid (EdgeNeXtSAC) to extract robust features, employing a segmentation-assisted classification pipeline to enhance lesion localization. Predictions from these models are fused with a gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) ensemble enriched by engineered features and patient-specific relational metrics. To address class imbalance and improve generalization, we augment malignant cases with Stable Diffusion-generated synthetic lesions and apply a diagnosis-informed relabeling strategy to harmonize external datasets into a 3-class format. Using partial AUC (pAUC) above 80 percent true positive rate (TPR) as the evaluation metric, our approach achieves a pAUC of 0.1755 -- the highest among all configurations. These results underscore the potential of hybrid, interpretable AI systems for skin cancer triage in telemedicine and resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Existing facial appearance capture methods can reconstruct plausible facial reflectance from smartphone-recorded videos. However, the reconstruction quality is still far behind the ones based on studio recordings. This paper fills the gap by developing a novel daily-used solution with a co-located smartphone and flashlight video capture setting in a dim room. To enhance the quality, our key observation is to solve facial reflectance maps within the data distribution of studio-scanned ones. Specifically, we first learn a diffusion prior over the Light Stage scans and then steer it to produce the reflectance map that best matches the captured images. We propose to train the diffusion prior at the patch level to improve generalization ability and training stability, as current Light Stage datasets are in ultra-high resolution but limited in data size. Tailored to this prior, we propose a patch-level posterior sampling technique to sample seamless full-resolution reflectance maps from this patch-level diffusion model. Experiments demonstrate our method closes the quality gap between low-cost and studio recordings by a large margin, opening the door for everyday users to clone themselves to the digital world. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yxuhan/DoRA.

<title>How Far Are We from Predicting Missing Modalities with Foundation Models?</title>

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their potential as plug-and-play solutions for missing modality prediction remains underexplored. To investigate this, we categorize existing approaches into three representative paradigms, encompassing a total of 42 model variants, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation in terms of prediction accuracy and adaptability to downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that current foundation models often fall short in two critical aspects: (i) fine-grained semantic extraction from the available modalities, and (ii) robust validation of generated modalities. These limitations lead to suboptimal and, at times, misaligned predictions. To address these challenges, we propose an agentic framework tailored for missing modality prediction. This framework dynamically formulates modality-aware mining strategies based on the input context, facilitating the extraction of richer and more discriminative semantic features. In addition, we introduce a \textit{self-refinement mechanism}, which iteratively verifies and enhances the quality of generated modalities through internal feedback. Experimental results show that our method reduces FID for missing image prediction by at least 14% and MER for missing text prediction by at least 10% compared to baselines.

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects prevalent in daily environments is crucial for applications in augmented/virtual reality and robotics. However, existing methods face scalability limitations (requiring 3D supervision or costly annotations), robustness issues (being susceptible to local optima), and rendering shortcomings (lacking speed or photorealism). We introduce SplArt, a self-supervised, category-agnostic framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to reconstruct articulated objects and infer kinematics from two sets of posed RGB images captured at different articulation states, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering for novel viewpoints and articulations. SplArt augments 3DGS with a differentiable mobility parameter per Gaussian, achieving refined part segmentation. A multi-stage optimization strategy is employed to progressively handle reconstruction, part segmentation, and articulation estimation, significantly enhancing robustness and accuracy. SplArt exploits geometric self-supervision, effectively addressing challenging scenarios without requiring 3D annotations or category-specific priors. Evaluations on established and newly proposed benchmarks, along with applications to real-world scenarios using a handheld RGB camera, demonstrate SplArt's state-of-the-art performance and real-world practicality. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ripl/splart.

Abstract: Visually impaired people could benefit from Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems to interpret text in their surroundings. However, current models often struggle with recognizing text in the photos taken by this population. Through in-depth interviews with visually impaired individuals, we identified common framing conventions that frequently result in misaligned text. Existing VQA benchmarks primarily feature well-oriented text captured by sighted users, under-representing these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce ROtated SAmpling (ROSA), a decoding strategy that enhances VQA performance in text-rich images with incorrectly oriented text. ROSA outperforms Greedy decoding by 11.7 absolute points in the best-performing model.

Abstract: Time-resolved CT is an advanced measurement technique that has been widely used to observe dynamic objects, including periodically varying structures such as hearts, lungs, or hearing structures. To reconstruct these objects from CT projections, a common approach is to divide the projections into several collections based on their motion phases and perform reconstruction within each collection, assuming they originate from a static object. This describes the gating-based method, which is the standard approach for time-periodic reconstruction. However, the gating-based reconstruction algorithm only utilizes a limited subset of projections within each collection and ignores the correlation between different collections, leading to inefficient use of the radiation dose. To address this issue, we propose two analytical reconstruction pipelines in this paper, and validate them with experimental data captured using tomographic synchrotron microscopy. We demonstrate that our approaches significantly reduce random noise in the reconstructed images without blurring the sharp features of the observed objects. Equivalently, our methods can achieve the same reconstruction quality as gating-based methods but with a lower radiation dose. Our code is available at github.com/PeriodRecon.

Abstract: Recent work has shown improved lesion detectability and flexibility to reconstruction hyperparameters (e.g. scanner geometry or dose level) when PET images are reconstructed by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models. Such methods train a diffusion model (without sinogram data) on high-quality, but still noisy, PET images. In this work, we propose a simple method for generating subject-specific PET images from a dataset of multi-subject PET-MR scans, synthesizing "pseudo-PET" images by transforming between different patients' anatomy using image registration. The images we synthesize retain information from the subject's MR scan, leading to higher resolution and the retention of anatomical features compared to the original set of PET images. With simulated and real [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets, we show that pre-training a personalized diffusion model with subject-specific "pseudo-PET" images improves reconstruction accuracy with low-count data. In particular, the method shows promise in combining information from a guidance MR scan without overly imposing anatomical features, demonstrating an improved trade-off between reconstructing PET-unique image features versus features present in both PET and MR. We believe this approach for generating and utilizing synthetic data has further applications to medical imaging tasks, particularly because patient-specific PET images can be generated without resorting to generative deep learning or large training datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems typically require high-quality studio data and accurate transcriptions for training. India has 1369 languages, with 22 official using 13 scripts. Training a TTS system for all these languages, most of which have no digital resources, seems a Herculean task. Our work focuses on zero-shot synthesis, particularly for languages whose scripts and phonotactics come from different families. The novelty of our work is in the augmentation of a shared phone representation and modifying the text parsing rules to match the phonotactics of the target language, thus reducing the synthesiser overhead and enabling rapid adaptation. Intelligible and natural speech was generated for Sanskrit, Maharashtrian and Canara Konkani, Maithili and Kurukh by leveraging linguistic connections across languages with suitable synthesisers. Evaluations confirm the effectiveness of this approach, highlighting its potential to expand speech technology access for under-represented languages.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown strong performance in classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) from R2* maps, but their decision-making remains opaque, raising concerns about interpretability. Previous studies suggest biases in model decisions, necessitating further analysis. This study uses Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and spectral clustering to explore classifier decision strategies across preprocessing and training configurations using R2* maps. We trained a 3D convolutional neural network on R2* maps, generating relevance heatmaps via LRP and applied spectral clustering to identify dominant patterns. t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization was used to assess clustering structure. Spectral clustering revealed distinct decision patterns, with the relevance-guided model showing the clearest separation between AD and normal control (NC) cases. The t-SNE visualization confirmed that this model aligned heatmap groupings with the underlying subject groups. Our findings highlight the significant impact of preprocessing and training choices on deep learning models trained on R2* maps, even with similar performance metrics. Spectral clustering offers a structured method to identify classification strategy differences, emphasizing the importance of explainability in medical AI.

<title>Rethinking the Stability-Plasticity Trade-off in Continual Learning from an Architectural Perspective</title>

Abstract: The quest for Continual Learning (CL) seeks to empower neural networks with the ability to learn and adapt incrementally. Central to this pursuit is addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma, which involves striking a balance between two conflicting objectives: preserving previously learned knowledge and acquiring new knowledge. While numerous CL methods aim to achieve this trade-off, they often overlook the impact of network architecture on stability and plasticity, restricting the trade-off to the parameter level. In this paper, we delve into the conflict between stability and plasticity at the architectural level. We reveal that under an equal parameter constraint, deeper networks exhibit better plasticity, while wider networks are characterized by superior stability. To address this architectural-level dilemma, we introduce a novel framework denoted Dual-Arch, which serves as a plug-in component for CL. This framework leverages the complementary strengths of two distinct and independent networks: one dedicated to plasticity and the other to stability. Each network is designed with a specialized and lightweight architecture, tailored to its respective objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dual-Arch enhances the performance of existing CL methods while being up to 87% more compact in terms of parameters.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to enable neural networks to incrementally acquire new knowledge (plasticity) while retaining existing knowledge (stability). While pre-trained models (PTMs) have become pivotal in CL, prevailing approaches freeze the PTM backbone to preserve stability, limiting their plasticity, particularly when encountering significant domain gaps in incremental tasks. Conversely, sequentially finetuning the entire PTM risks catastrophic forgetting of generalizable knowledge, exposing a critical stability-plasticity trade-off. To address this challenge, we propose Adapting PTMs before the core CL process (ACL), a novel framework that refines the PTM backbone through a plug-and-play adaptation phase before learning each new task with existing CL approaches (e.g., prompt tuning). ACL enhances plasticity by aligning embeddings with their original class prototypes while distancing them from others, theoretically and empirically shown to balance stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACL significantly improves CL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods, offering a versatile solution for PTM-based CL.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have proven to be effective in modeling high-dimensional distributions, leading to their widespread adoption for representing complex priors in Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). However, current DM-based posterior sampling methods proposed for solving common BIPs rely on heuristic approximations to the generative process. To exploit the generative capability of DMs and avoid the usage of such approximations, we propose an ensemble-based algorithm that performs posterior sampling without the use of heuristic approximations. Our algorithm is motivated by existing works that combine DM-based methods with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method. By examining how the prior evolves through the diffusion process encoded by the pre-trained score function, we derive a modified partial differential equation (PDE) governing the evolution of the corresponding posterior distribution. This PDE includes a modified diffusion term and a reweighting term, which can be simulated via stochastic weighted particle methods. Theoretically, we prove that the error between the true posterior distribution can be bounded in terms of the training error of the pre-trained score function and the number of particles in the ensemble. Empirically, we validate our algorithm on several inverse problems in imaging to show that our method gives more accurate reconstructions compared to existing DM-based methods.

Abstract: Typical video modeling methods, such as LLava, represent videos as sequences of visual tokens, which are then processed by the LLM backbone for effective video understanding. However, this approach leads to a massive number of visual tokens, especially for long videos. A practical solution is to first extract relevant visual information from the large visual context before feeding it into the LLM backbone, thereby reducing computational overhead. In this work, we introduce DynTok, a novel \textbf{Dyn}amic video \textbf{Tok}en compression strategy. DynTok adaptively splits visual tokens into groups and merges them within each group, achieving high compression in regions with low information density while preserving essential content. Our method reduces the number of tokens to 44.4% of the original size while maintaining comparable performance. It further benefits from increasing the number of video frames and achieves 65.3% on Video-MME and 72.5% on MLVU. By applying this simple yet effective compression method, we expose the redundancy in video token representations and offer insights for designing more efficient video modeling techniques.

Abstract: Human learning and conceptual representation is grounded in sensorimotor experience, in contrast to state-of-the-art foundation models. In this paper, we investigate how well such large-scale models, trained on vast quantities of data, represent the semantic feature norms of concrete object concepts, e.g. a ROSE is red, smells sweet, and is a flower. More specifically, we use probing tasks to test which properties of objects these models are aware of. We evaluate image encoders trained on image data alone, as well as multimodally-trained image encoders and language-only models, on predicting an extended denser version of the classic McRae norms and the newer Binder dataset of attribute ratings. We find that multimodal image encoders slightly outperform language-only approaches, and that image-only encoders perform comparably to the language models, even on non-visual attributes that are classified as "encyclopedic" or "function". These results offer new insights into what can be learned from pure unimodal learning, and the complementarity of the modalities.

Abstract: We explore how minimal neural networks can invert the renormalization group (RG) coarse-graining procedure in the two-dimensional Ising model, effectively "dreaming up" microscopic configurations from coarse-grained states. This task-formally impossible at the level of configurations-can be approached probabilistically, allowing machine learning models to reconstruct scale-invariant distributions without relying on microscopic input. We demonstrate that even neural networks with as few as three trainable parameters can learn to generate critical configurations, reproducing the scaling behavior of observables such as magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Binder ratios. A real-space renormalization group analysis of the generated configurations confirms that the models capture not only scale invariance but also reproduce nontrivial eigenvalues of the RG transformation. Surprisingly, we find that increasing network complexity by introducing multiple layers offers no significant benefit. These findings suggest that simple local rules, akin to those generating fractal structures, are sufficient to encode the universality of critical phenomena, opening the door to efficient generative models of statistical ensembles in physics.

Abstract: Incidental detection and quantification of coronary calcium in CT scans could lead to the early introduction of lifesaving clinical interventions. However, over-reporting could negatively affect patient wellbeing and unnecessarily burden the medical system. Therefore, careful considerations should be taken when automatically reporting coronary calcium scores. A cluster-based conditional conformal prediction framework is proposed to provide score intervals with calibrated coverage from trained segmentation networks without retraining. The proposed method was tuned and used to calibrate predictive intervals for 3D UNet models (deterministic, MCDropout and deep ensemble) reaching similar coverage with better triage metrics compared to conventional conformal prediction. Meaningful predictive intervals of calcium scores could help triage patients according to the confidence of their risk category prediction.

Abstract: An essential step in deploying medical imaging models is ensuring alignment with clinical knowledge and interpretability. We focus on mapping clinical concepts into the latent space of generative models to identify Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs). Using a simple reconstruction autoencoder, we link user-defined concepts to image-level features without explicit label training. The extracted concepts are stable across datasets, enabling visual explanations that highlight clinically relevant features. By traversing latent space along concept directions, we produce counterfactuals that exaggerate or reduce specific clinical features. Preliminary results on chest X-rays show promise for large pathologies like cardiomegaly, while smaller pathologies remain challenging due to reconstruction limits. Although not outperforming baselines, this approach offers a path toward interpretable, concept-based explanations aligned with clinical knowledge.

<title>Optimal Transport-based Domain Alignment as a Preprocessing Step for Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a subfield of machine learning that avoids sharing local data with a central server, which can enhance privacy and scalability. The inability to consolidate data leads to a unique problem called dataset imbalance, where agents in a network do not have equal representation of the labels one is trying to learn to predict. In FL, fusing locally-trained models with unbalanced datasets may deteriorate the performance of global model aggregation, and reduce the quality of updated local models and the accuracy of the distributed agents' decisions. In this work, we introduce an Optimal Transport-based preprocessing algorithm that aligns the datasets by minimizing the distributional discrepancy of data along the edge devices. We accomplish this by leveraging Wasserstein barycenters when computing channel-wise averages. These barycenters are collected in a trusted central server where they collectively generate a target RGB space. By projecting our dataset towards this target space, we minimize the distributional discrepancy on a global level, which facilitates the learning process due to a minimization of variance across the samples. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach over the CIFAR-10 dataset, where we show its capability of reaching higher degrees of generalization in fewer communication rounds.

Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves multi-step information extraction and logical inference over tabular data. While recent advances have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over structured tables, such high-quality textual representations are often unavailable in real-world settings, where tables typically appear as images. In this paper, we tackle the task of tabular reasoning from table images, leveraging privileged structured information available during training to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The key challenges lie in the complexity of accurately aligning structured information with visual representations, and in effectively transferring structured reasoning skills to MLLMs despite the input modality gap. To address these, we introduce TabUlar Reasoning with Bridged infOrmation ({\sc Turbo}), a new framework for multimodal tabular reasoning with privileged structured tables. {\sc Turbo} benefits from a structure-aware reasoning trace generator based on DeepSeek-R1, contributing to high-quality modality-bridged data. On this basis, {\sc Turbo} repeatedly generates and selects the advantageous reasoning paths, further enhancing the model's tabular reasoning ability. Experimental results demonstrate that, with limited ($9$k) data, {\sc Turbo} achieves state-of-the-art performance ($+7.2\%$ vs. previous SOTA) across multiple datasets.

<title>A Diffusion-Driven Temporal Super-Resolution and Spatial Consistency Enhancement Framework for 4D MRI imaging</title>

Abstract: In medical imaging, 4D MRI enables dynamic 3D visualization, yet the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution requires prolonged scan time that can compromise temporal fidelity--especially during rapid, large-amplitude motion. Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.

Abstract: Over the past decade, Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has achieved significant performance improvements and holds great promise for future developments. This paper presents a comprehensive study on MIS based on DNNs. Intelligent Vision Systems are often evaluated based on their output levels, such as Data, Information, Knowledge, Intelligence, and Wisdom (DIKIW),and the state-of-the-art solutions in MIS at these levels are the focus of research. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an important research direction, as it aims to uncover the "black box" nature of previous DNN architectures to meet the requirements of transparency and ethics. The study emphasizes the importance of MIS in disease diagnosis and early detection, particularly for increasing the survival rate of cancer patients through timely diagnosis. XAI and early prediction are considered two important steps in the journey from "intelligence" to "wisdom." Additionally, the paper addresses existing challenges and proposes potential solutions to enhance the efficiency of implementing DNN-based MIS.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning. Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models, even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3) Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath, LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.

Abstract: Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop approach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.

Abstract: Learning robot control policies from human videos is a promising direction for scaling up robot learning. However, how to extract action knowledge (or action representations) from videos for policy learning remains a key challenge. Existing action representations such as video frames, pixelflow, and pointcloud flow have inherent limitations such as modeling complexity or loss of information. In this paper, we propose to use object-centric 3D motion field to represent actions for robot learning from human videos, and present a novel framework for extracting this representation from videos for zero-shot control. We introduce two novel components in its implementation. First, a novel training pipeline for training a ''denoising'' 3D motion field estimator to extract fine object 3D motions from human videos with noisy depth robustly. Second, a dense object-centric 3D motion field prediction architecture that favors both cross-embodiment transfer and policy generalization to background. We evaluate the system in real world setups. Experiments show that our method reduces 3D motion estimation error by over 50% compared to the latest method, achieve 55% average success rate in diverse tasks where prior approaches fail~($\lesssim 10$\%), and can even acquire fine-grained manipulation skills like insertion.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for video understanding are primarily fine-tuned with various videos scraped from online platforms. Existing datasets, such as ActivityNet, require considerable human labor for structuring and annotation before effectively utilized for tuning LVLMs. While current LVLMs are primarily trained on existing datasets in broad, general-purpose settings, adapting them to specific downstream scenarios remains challenging, as collecting and annotating task-specific videos is highly labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a three-stage framework named DreamFrame for automatically generating style-consistent keyframes and corresponding question-answer (QA) pairs to support LVLM instruction tuning. DreamFrame generates datasets in a movie-like manner. First, we utilize an LLM to generate structured movie plots including movie prior information (like overview and style), frame descriptions and plot-related QA pairs, with a story expansion strategy to mitigate context length limitations.Then, to ensure visual consistency across generated frames, we design a Style Immobilization Process which maintains consistent style through an embedding learning strategy. Finally, frame descriptions and style embeddings are integrated to produce coherent keyframes. Using DreamFrame, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 1k stylized keyframe-like videos and 100k diverse QA pairs. Extensive fine-tuned experiments on various LVLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Furthermore, based on the proposed dataset, we fine-tune a new LVLM named DreamFrame-7B, which significantly surpasses the previous similar-sized LVLMs across different benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite achieving outstanding performance on various cross-modal tasks, current large vision-language models (LVLMs) still suffer from hallucination issues, manifesting as inconsistencies between their generated responses and the corresponding images. Prior research has implicated that the low quality of instruction data, particularly the skewed balance between positive and negative samples, is a significant contributor to model hallucinations. Recently, researchers have proposed high-quality instruction datasets, such as LRV-Instruction, to mitigate model hallucination. Nonetheless, our investigation reveals that hallucinatory concepts from different LVLMs exhibit specificity, i.e. the distribution of hallucinatory concepts varies significantly across models. Existing datasets did not consider the hallucination specificity of different models in the design processes, thereby diminishing their efficacy in mitigating model hallucination. In this paper, we propose a targeted instruction data generation framework named DFTG that tailored to the hallucination specificity of different models. Concretely, DFTG consists of two stages: hallucination diagnosis, which extracts the necessary information from the model's responses and images for hallucination diagnosis; and targeted data generation, which generates targeted instruction data based on diagnostic results. The experimental results on hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that the targeted instruction data generated by our method are more effective in mitigating hallucinations compared to previous datasets.

Abstract: Sparse-aspect multi-baseline Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) three-dimensional (3D) tomography is a crucial remote sensing technique. Compared to full-aspect observation, it needs only a few observation aspects to achieve a sufficiently clear 3D scene reconstruction, providing a cost-effective alternative. In the past, compressive sensing (CS) was the mainstream approach for sparse 3D SAR imaging. Recently, deep learning (DL) revolutionizes this field through its powerful data-driven representation capabilities and efficient inference characteristics. However, existing DL methods primarily depend on high-resolution radar images for supervising the training of deep neural networks (DNNs). This unimodal approach precludes the incorporation of complementary information from other data sources, thereby limiting potential improvements in imaging performance. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal 3D-SAR Reconstruction Network (CMAR-Net) that enhances 3D SAR imaging by fusing heterogeneous information. Leveraging cross-modal supervision from 2D optical images and error transfer guaranteed by differentiable rendering, CMAR-Net achieves efficient training and reconstructs highly sparse-aspect multi-baseline SAR image into visually structured and accurate 3D images, particularly for vehicle targets. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that CMAR-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sparse reconstruction algorithms based on CS and DL, with average improvements of 75.83% in PSNR and 47.85% in SSIM. Furthermore, our method eliminates the need for time-consuming full-aperture data preprocessing and relies solely on computer-rendered optical images, significantly reducing dataset construction costs. This work highlights the potential of cross-modal learning for multi-baseline SAR 3D imaging and introduces a novel framework for radar imaging research.

Abstract: Deception detection has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to the significant growth of digital media and heightened ethical and security concerns. It has been extensively studied using multimodal methods, including video, audio, and text. In addition, individual differences in deception production and detection are believed to play a crucial role.Although some studies have utilized individual information such as personality traits to enhance the performance of deception detection, current systems remain limited, partly due to a lack of sufficient datasets for evaluating performance. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal deception dataset MDPE. Besides deception features, this dataset also includes individual differences information in personality and emotional expression characteristics. It can explore the impact of individual differences on deception behavior. It comprises over 104 hours of deception and emotional videos from 193 subjects. Furthermore, we conducted numerous experiments to provide valuable insights for future deception detection research. MDPE not only supports deception detection, but also provides conditions for tasks such as personality recognition and emotion recognition, and can even study the relationships between them. We believe that MDPE will become a valuable resource for promoting research in the field of affective computing.

Abstract: The majority of quantization methods have been proposed to reduce the model size of Vision Transformers, yet most of them have overlooked the quantization of non-linear operations. Only a few works have addressed quantization for non-linear operations, but they applied a single quantization method across all non-linear operations. We believe that this can be further improved by employing a different quantization method for each non-linear operation. Therefore, to assign the most error-minimizing quantization method from the known methods to each non-linear layer, we propose a mixed non-linear quantization that considers layer-wise quantization sensitivity measured by SQNR difference metric. The results show that our method outperforms I-BERT, FQ-ViT, and I-ViT in both 8-bit and 6-bit settings for ViT, DeiT, and Swin models by an average of 0.6%p and 19.6%p, respectively. Our method outperforms I-BERT and I-ViT by 0.6%p and 20.8%p, respectively, when training time is limited. We plan to release our code at https://gitlab.com/ones-ai/mixed-non-linear-quantization.

Abstract: This paper introduces EasyInv, an easy yet novel approach that significantly advances the field of DDIM Inversion by addressing the inherent inefficiencies and performance limitations of traditional iterative optimization methods. At the core of our EasyInv is a refined strategy for approximating inversion noise, which is pivotal for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the inversion process. By prioritizing the initial latent state, which encapsulates rich information about the original images, EasyInv steers clear of the iterative refinement of noise items. Instead, we introduce a methodical aggregation of the latent state from the preceding time step with the current state, effectively increasing the influence of the initial latent state and mitigating the impact of noise. We illustrate that EasyInv is capable of delivering results that are either on par with or exceed those of the conventional DDIM Inversion approach, especially under conditions where the model's precision is limited or computational resources are scarce. Concurrently, our EasyInv offers an approximate threefold enhancement regarding inference efficiency over off-the-shelf iterative optimization techniques. It can be easily combined with most existing inversion methods by only four lines of code. See code at https://github.com/potato-kitty/EasyInv.

Abstract: People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses. Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.

Abstract: Point cloud sequence-based 3D action recognition has achieved impressive performance and efficiency. However, existing point cloud sequence modeling methods cannot adequately balance the precision of limb micro-movements with the integrity of posture macro-structure, leading to the loss of crucial information cues in action inference. To overcome this limitation, we introduce D-Hyperpoint, a novel data type generated through a D-Hyperpoint Embedding module. D-Hyperpoint encapsulates both regional-momentary motion and global-static posture, effectively summarizing the unit human action at each moment. In addition, we present a D-Hyperpoint KANsMixer module, which is recursively applied to nested groupings of D-Hyperpoints to learn the action discrimination information and creatively integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to enhance spatio-temporal interaction within D-Hyperpoints. Finally, we propose KAN-HyperpointNet, a spatio-temporal decoupled network architecture for 3D action recognition. Extensive experiments on two public datasets: MSR Action3D and NTU-RGB+D 60, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

Abstract: Synthesizing anomaly samples has proven to be an effective strategy for self-supervised 2D industrial anomaly detection. However, this approach has been rarely explored in multi-modality anomaly detection, particularly involving 3D and RGB images. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-modality augmentation method for 3D anomaly synthesis, which is simple and capable of mimicking the characteristics of 3D defects. Incorporating with our anomaly synthesis method, we introduce a reconstruction-based discriminative anomaly detection network, in which a dual-modal discriminator is employed to fuse the original and reconstructed embedding of two modalities for anomaly detection. Additionally, we design an augmentation dropout mechanism to enhance the generalizability of the discriminator. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on detection precision and achieves competitive segmentation performance on both MVTec 3D-AD and Eyescandies datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models have propelled the development of joint probabilistic models capable of both image understanding and generation. However, we have identified that recent methods suffer from loss of image information during understanding task, due to either image discretization or diffusion denoising steps. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Auto-Regressive (MMAR) probabilistic modeling framework. Unlike discretization line of method, MMAR takes in continuous-valued image tokens to avoid information loss in an efficient way. Differing from diffusion-based approaches, we disentangle the diffusion process from auto-regressive backbone model by employing a light-weight diffusion head on top each auto-regressed image patch embedding. In this way, when the model transits from image generation to understanding through text generation, the backbone model's hidden representation of the image is not limited to the last denoising step. To successfully train our method, we also propose a theoretically proven technique that addresses the numerical stability issue and a training strategy that balances the generation and understanding task goals. Extensive evaluations on 18 image understanding benchmarks show that MMAR significantly outperforms most of the existing joint multi-modal models, surpassing the method that employs pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. Meanwhile, MMAR is able to generate high quality images. We also show that our method is scalable with larger data and model size.

<title>Objective drives the consistency of representational similarity across datasets</title>

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis claims that recent foundation models are converging to a shared representation space as a function of their downstream task performance, irrespective of the objectives and data modalities used to train these models (Huh et al., 2024). Representational similarity is generally measured for individual datasets and is not necessarily consistent across datasets. Thus, one may wonder whether this convergence of model representations is confounded by the datasets commonly used in machine learning. Here, we propose a systematic way to measure how representational similarity between models varies with the set of stimuli used to construct the representations. We find that the objective function is a crucial factor in determining the consistency of representational similarities across datasets. Specifically, self-supervised vision models learn representations whose relative pairwise similarities generalize better from one dataset to another compared to those of image classification or image-text models. Moreover, the correspondence between representational similarities and the models' task behavior is dataset-dependent, being most strongly pronounced for single-domain datasets. Our work provides a framework for analyzing similarities of model representations across datasets and linking those similarities to differences in task behavior.

Abstract: Subject-driven text-to-image generation aims to produce images of a new subject within a desired context by accurately capturing both the visual characteristics of the subject and the semantic content of a text prompt. Traditional methods rely on time- and resource-intensive fine-tuning for subject alignment, while recent zero-shot approaches leverage on-the-fly image prompting, often sacrificing subject alignment. In this paper, we introduce Diptych Prompting, a novel zero-shot approach that reinterprets as an inpainting task with precise subject alignment by leveraging the emergent property of diptych generation in large-scale text-to-image models. Diptych Prompting arranges an incomplete diptych with the reference image in the left panel, and performs text-conditioned inpainting on the right panel. We further prevent unwanted content leakage by removing the background in the reference image and improve fine-grained details in the generated subject by enhancing attention weights between the panels during inpainting. Experimental results confirm that our approach significantly outperforms zero-shot image prompting methods, resulting in images that are visually preferred by users. Additionally, our method supports not only subject-driven generation but also stylized image generation and subject-driven image editing, demonstrating versatility across diverse image generation applications.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for acquiring transferable 3D representations from unlabeled 3D point clouds. Unlike 2D images, which are widely accessible, acquiring 3D assets requires specialized expertise or professional 3D scanning equipment, making it difficult to scale and raising copyright concerns. To address these challenges, we propose learning 3D representations from procedural 3D programs that automatically generate 3D shapes using simple primitives and augmentations. Remarkably, despite lacking semantic content, the 3D representations learned from the procedurally generated 3D shapes perform on par with state-of-the-art representations learned from semantically recognizable 3D models (e.g., airplanes) across various downstream 3D tasks, including shape classification, part segmentation, and masked point cloud completion. We provide a detailed analysis on factors that make a good 3D procedural program. Extensive experiments further suggest that current self-supervised learning methods on point clouds do not rely on the semantics of 3D shapes, shedding light on the nature of 3D representations learned.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of synthesized images remains a significant challenge in the development of text-to-image (T2I) generation. Most existing studies in this area primarily focus on evaluating text-image alignment, image quality, and object composition capabilities, with comparatively fewer studies addressing the evaluation of the factuality of T2I models, particularly when the concepts involved are knowledge-intensive. To mitigate this gap, we present T2I-FactualBench in this work - the largest benchmark to date in terms of the number of concepts and prompts specifically designed to evaluate the factuality of knowledge-intensive concept generation. T2I-FactualBench consists of a three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation framework, ranging from the basic memorization of individual knowledge concepts to the more complex composition of multiple knowledge concepts. We further introduce a multi-round visual question answering (VQA) based evaluation framework to assess the factuality of three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation tasks. Experiments on T2I-FactualBench indicate that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models still leave significant room for improvement.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available in https://github.com/aiming-lab/MMedPO.

Abstract: We address the problem of gaze target estimation, which aims to predict where a person is looking in a scene. Predicting a person's gaze target requires reasoning both about the person's appearance and the contents of the scene. Prior works have developed increasingly complex, hand-crafted pipelines for gaze target estimation that carefully fuse features from separate scene encoders, head encoders, and auxiliary models for signals like depth and pose. Motivated by the success of general-purpose feature extractors on a variety of visual tasks, we propose Gaze-LLE, a novel transformer framework that streamlines gaze target estimation by leveraging features from a frozen DINOv2 encoder. We extract a single feature representation for the scene, and apply a person-specific positional prompt to decode gaze with a lightweight module. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across several gaze benchmarks and provide extensive analysis to validate our design choices. Our code is available at: http://github.com/fkryan/gazelle .

Abstract: While unlabeled image data is often plentiful, the costs of high-quality labels pose an important practical challenge: Which images should one select for labeling to use the annotation budget for a particular target task most effectively? To address this problem, we focus on single-pass data selection, which refers to the process of selecting all data to be annotated at once before training a downstream model. Prior methods for single-pass data selection rely on image-level representations and fail to reliably outperform random selection for object detection and segmentation. We propose Object-Focused Data Selection (OFDS) which leverages object-level features from foundation models and ensures semantic coverage of all target classes. In extensive experiments across tasks and target domains, OFDS consistently outperforms random selection and all baselines. The best results for constrained annotation budgets are obtained by combining human labels from OFDS with autolabels from foundation models. Moreover, using OFDS to select the initial labeled set for active learning yields consistent improvements

Abstract: In this paper, we present a contrastive learning based framework, ExeChecker, for the interpretation of rehabilitation exercises. Our work builds upon state-of-the-art advances in the area of human pose estimation, graph-attention neural networks, and transformer interpretablity. The downstream task is to assist rehabilitation by providing informative feedback to users while they are performing prescribed exercises. We utilize a contrastive learning strategy during training. Given a tuple of correctly and incorrectly executed exercises, our model is able to identify and highlight those joints that are involved in an incorrect movement and thus require the user's attention. We collected an in-house dataset, ExeCheck, with paired recordings of both correct and incorrect execution of exercises. In our experiments, we tested our method on this dataset as well as the UI-PRMD dataset and found ExeCheck outperformed the baseline method using pairwise sequence alignment in identifying joints of physical relevance in rehabilitation exercises.

Abstract: Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial fusion (FSF) image encoder, a cross-modal alignment training method for embedding models with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying and retrieval pipeline based on K-Means clustering and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3 to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the CODA and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.

Abstract: Multi-person human mesh recovery (HMR) consists in detecting all individuals in a given input image, and predicting the body shape, pose, and 3D location for each detected person. The dominant approaches to this task rely on neural networks trained to output a single prediction for each detected individual. In contrast, we propose CondiMen, a method that outputs a joint parametric distribution over likely poses, body shapes, intrinsics and distances to the camera, using a Bayesian network. This approach offers several advantages. First, a probability distribution can handle some inherent ambiguities of this task -- such as the uncertainty between a person's size and their distance to the camera, or simply the loss of information when projecting 3D data onto the 2D image plane. Second, the output distribution can be combined with additional information to produce better predictions, by using e.g. known camera or body shape parameters, or by exploiting multi-view observations. Third, one can efficiently extract the most likely predictions from the output distribution, making our proposed approach suitable for real-time applications. Empirically we find that our model i) achieves performance on par with or better than the state-of-the-art, ii) captures uncertainties and correlations inherent in pose estimation and iii) can exploit additional information at test time, such as multi-view consistency or body shape priors. CondiMen spices up the modeling of ambiguity, using just the right ingredients on hand.

Abstract: Diffusion models, particularly latent diffusion models, have demonstrated remarkable success in text-driven human motion generation. However, it remains challenging for latent diffusion models to effectively compose multiple semantic concepts into a single, coherent motion sequence. To address this issue, we propose EnergyMoGen, which includes two spectrums of Energy-Based Models: (1) We interpret the diffusion model as a latent-aware energy-based model that generates motions by composing a set of diffusion models in latent space; (2) We introduce a semantic-aware energy model based on cross-attention, which enables semantic composition and adaptive gradient descent for text embeddings. To overcome the challenges of semantic inconsistency and motion distortion across these two spectrums, we introduce Synergistic Energy Fusion. This design allows the motion latent diffusion model to synthesize high-quality, complex motions by combining multiple energy terms corresponding to textual descriptions. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on various motion generation tasks, including text-to-motion generation, compositional motion generation, and multi-concept motion generation. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can be used to extend motion datasets and improve the text-to-motion task.

<title>Visual Attention Never Fades: Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration for Detailed Image Captioning in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Detailed image captioning is essential for tasks like data generation and aiding visually impaired individuals. High-quality captions require a balance between precision and recall, which remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we hypothesize that this limitation stems from weakening and increasingly noisy visual attention as responses lengthen. To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the contribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key observations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall; thus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen, visual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by leveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention gradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence. Our experiments, incorporating both automated and human evaluations, demonstrate that existing methods improve the precision of MLLMs at the cost of recall. In contrast, our proposed method enhances both precision and recall with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Flag manifolds encode nested sequences of subspaces and serve as powerful structures for various computer vision and machine learning applications. Despite their utility in tasks such as dimensionality reduction, motion averaging, and subspace clustering, current applications are often restricted to extracting flags using common matrix decomposition methods like the singular value decomposition. Here, we address the need for a general algorithm to factorize and work with hierarchical datasets. In particular, we propose a novel, flag-based method that decomposes arbitrary hierarchical real-valued data into a hierarchy-preserving flag representation in Stiefel coordinates. Our work harnesses the potential of flag manifolds in applications including denoising, clustering, and few-shot learning.

Abstract: The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been extensively researched for large language models in downstream tasks. Among all the existing approaches, the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity for its streamlined design by incorporating low-rank matrices into existing pre-trained models. Though effective, LoRA, as well as its adaptive optimizations, either allocate the same matrix to all the modules or adjust the interior rank of the components based on importance scoring indicators. In this paper, we argue that not all the modules in LLMs are suitable and necessary to be fine-tuned. Enlightened by this insight, we propose a new PEFT scheme called DiffoRA, which enables adaptive adoption of the low-rank decomposition matrices. At the core of DiffoRA lies a Differential Adaptation Matrix (DAM) to determine which module is the most suitable and essential for fine-tuning. We theoretically explain how the designed matrix impacts the convergence rate and generalization capability of a pre-trained model. We then construct the DAM via continuous relaxation and discretization with weight-sharing optimizations. We fully implement DiffoRA and design comprehensive experiments to evaluate its performance. The experimental results demonstrate that DiffoRA delivers state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce a highly multimodal transformer to represent many remote sensing modalities - multispectral optical, synthetic aperture radar, elevation, weather, pseudo-labels, and more - across space and time. These inputs are useful for diverse remote sensing tasks, such as crop mapping and flood detection. However, learning shared representations of remote sensing data is challenging, given the diversity of relevant data modalities, and because objects of interest vary massively in scale, from small boats (1-2 pixels and fast) to glaciers (thousands of pixels and slow). We present a novel self-supervised learning algorithm that extracts multi-scale features across a flexible set of input modalities through masked modeling. Our dual global and local contrastive losses differ in their targets (deep representations vs. shallow input projections) and masking strategies (structured vs. not). Our Galileo is a single generalist model that outperforms SoTA specialist models for satellite images and pixel time series across eleven benchmarks and multiple tasks.

Abstract: Image tokenization has enabled major advances in autoregressive image generation by providing compressed, discrete representations that are more efficient to process than raw pixels. While traditional approaches use 2D grid tokenization, recent methods like TiTok have shown that 1D tokenization can achieve high generation quality by eliminating grid redundancies. However, these methods typically use a fixed number of tokens and thus cannot adapt to an image's inherent complexity. We introduce FlexTok, a tokenizer that projects 2D images into variable-length, ordered 1D token sequences. For example, a 256x256 image can be resampled into anywhere from 1 to 256 discrete tokens, hierarchically and semantically compressing its information. By training a rectified flow model as the decoder and using nested dropout, FlexTok produces plausible reconstructions regardless of the chosen token sequence length. We evaluate our approach in an autoregressive generation setting using a simple GPT-style Transformer. On ImageNet, this approach achieves an FID<2 across 8 to 128 tokens, outperforming TiTok and matching state-of-the-art methods with far fewer tokens. We further extend the model to support to text-conditioned image generation and examine how FlexTok relates to traditional 2D tokenization. A key finding is that FlexTok enables next-token prediction to describe images in a coarse-to-fine "visual vocabulary", and that the number of tokens to generate depends on the complexity of the generation task.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated image (AIGI) models presents new challenges for evaluating image quality, particularly across three aspects: perceptual quality, prompt correspondence, and authenticity. To address these challenges, we introduce M3-AGIQA, a comprehensive framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enable more human-aligned, holistic evaluation of AI-generated images across both visual and textual domains. Besides, our framework features a structured multi-round evaluation process, generating and analyzing intermediate image descriptions to provide deeper insight into these three aspects. By aligning model outputs more closely with human judgment, M3-AGIQA delivers robust and interpretable quality scores. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on tested datasets and aspects, and exhibits strong generalizability in most cross-dataset settings.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) for object detection aims to enhance detectors' performance in unseen scenarios. This task remains challenging due to complex variations in real-world applications. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diverse scene generation, which inspires us to explore their potential for improving DG tasks. Instead of generating images, our method extracts multi-step intermediate features during the diffusion process to obtain domain-invariant features for generalized detection. Furthermore, we propose an efficient knowledge transfer framework that enables detectors to inherit the generalization capabilities of diffusion models through feature and object-level alignment, without increasing inference time. We conduct extensive experiments on six challenging DG benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements of 14.0% mAP over existing DG approaches across different domains and corruption types. Notably, our method even outperforms most domain adaptation methods without accessing any target domain data. Moreover, the diffusion-guided detectors show consistent improvements of 15.9% mAP on average compared to the baseline. Our work aims to present an effective approach for domain-generalized detection and provide potential insights for robust visual recognition in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on multimodal mathematical reasoning, particularly emphasizing the creation of relevant datasets and benchmarks. Despite this, the role of visual information in reasoning has been underexplored. Our findings show that existing multimodal mathematical models minimally leverage visual information, and model performance remains largely unaffected by changes to or removal of images in the dataset. We attribute this to the dominance of textual information and answer options that inadvertently guide the model to correct answers. To improve evaluation methods, we introduce the HC-M3D dataset, specifically designed to require image reliance for problem-solving and to challenge models with similar, yet distinct, images that change the correct answer. In testing leading models, their failure to detect these subtle visual differences suggests limitations in current visual perception capabilities. Additionally, we observe that the common approach of improving general VQA capabilities by combining various types of image encoders does not contribute to math reasoning performance. This finding also presents a challenge to enhancing visual reliance during math reasoning. Our benchmark and code would be available at \href{https://github.com/Yufang-Liu/visual_modality_role}{https://github.com/Yufang-Liu/visual\_modality\_role}.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that, when trained at scale, uni-modal 2D vision and text encoders converge to learned features that share remarkable structural properties, despite arising from different representations. However, the role of 3D encoders with respect to other modalities remains unexplored. Furthermore, existing 3D foundation models that leverage large datasets are typically trained with explicit alignment objectives with respect to frozen encoders from other representations. In this work, we investigate the possibility of a posteriori alignment of representations obtained from uni-modal 3D encoders compared to text-based feature spaces. We show that naive post-training feature alignment of uni-modal text and 3D encoders results in limited performance. We then focus on extracting subspaces of the corresponding feature spaces and discover that by projecting learned representations onto well-chosen lower-dimensional subspaces the quality of alignment becomes significantly higher, leading to improved accuracy on matching and retrieval tasks. Our analysis further sheds light on the nature of these shared subspaces, which roughly separate between semantic and geometric data representations. Overall, ours is the first work that helps to establish a baseline for post-training alignment of 3D uni-modal and text feature spaces, and helps to highlight both the shared and unique properties of 3D data compared to other representations. Our code and weights are available at https://github.com/Souhail-01/3d-text-alignment

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SemHiTok, a unified image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook that provides consistent discrete representations for multimodal understanding and generation. Recently, unified image tokenizers have sparked exploration within research community, which is designed to capture high-level semantic features for understanding and retaining low-level pixel features for generation. Previous works attempt to train a unified image tokenizer by combining loss for semantic distillation and pixel reconstruction. However, due to the differing levels of features prioritized by multimodal understanding and generation, joint training methods face significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses this challenge through a novel semantic-guided hierarchical codebook, which builds pixel sub-codebooks on a pretrained semantic codebook. This design decouples semantic and pixel both in terms of structure and training strategy, enabling the tokenizer to capture pixel features while retaining its ability to comprehend high-level semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that SemHiTok achieves SOTA performance in image reconstruction and multimodal understanding under LLaVA-v1.5 setting. Further, we develop a unified MLLM with SemHiTok, which exhibits superior performance across multimodal understanding and generation tasks. For understanding, SemHiTok achieves impressive performance on most benchmarks. For generation, our model achieves SOTA performance on MJHQ30K in unified MLLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancing of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in complex multimodal reasoning tasks in the real-world and virtual environment, which require coordinating multiple abilities, including visual perception, visual reasoning, spatial awareness, and target deduction. However, existing evaluations primarily assess the final task completion, often degrading assessments to isolated abilities such as visual grounding and visual question answering. Less attention is given to comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing reasoning process in multimodal environments, which is crucial for understanding model behaviors and underlying reasoning mechanisms beyond merely task success. To address this, we introduce MM-Escape, an extensible benchmark for investigating multimodal reasoning, inspired by real-world escape games. MM-Escape emphasizes intermediate model behaviors alongside final task completion. To achieve this, we develop EscapeCraft, a customizable and open environment that enables models to engage in free-form exploration for assessing multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments show that MLLMs, regardless of scale, can successfully complete the simplest room escape tasks, with some exhibiting human-like exploration strategies. Yet, performance dramatically drops as task difficulty increases. Moreover, we observe that performance bottlenecks vary across models, revealing distinct failure modes and limitations in their multimodal reasoning abilities, such as repetitive trajectories without adaptive exploration, getting stuck in corners due to poor visual spatial awareness, and ineffective use of acquired props, such as the key. We hope our work sheds light on new challenges in multimodal reasoning, and uncovers potential improvements in MLLMs capabilities.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning is crucial for robust video understanding but remains underexplored in existing multimodal benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{COVER} (\textbf{\underline{CO}}unterfactual \textbf{\underline{V}}id\textbf{\underline{E}}o \textbf{\underline{R}}easoning), a multidimensional multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across the abstract-concrete and perception-cognition dimensions. Beyond prior multimodal benchmarks, COVER decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions, enabling fine-grained reasoning analysis. Experiments on commercial and open-source models reveal a strong correlation between sub-question accuracy and counterfactual reasoning performance, highlighting the role of structured inference in video understanding. Furthermore, our results suggest a key insight: enhancing the reasoning capability of models is essential for improving the robustness of video understanding. COVER establishes a new standard for assessing MLLMs' logical reasoning abilities in dynamic environments. Our work is available at https://github.com/gongyifan-hash/COVER-Benchmark.

Abstract: Monitoring wildlife is essential for ecology and ethology, especially in light of the increasing human impact on ecosystems. Camera traps have emerged as habitat-centric sensors enabling the study of wildlife populations at scale with minimal disturbance. However, the lack of annotated video datasets limits the development of powerful video understanding models needed to process the vast amount of fieldwork data collected. To advance research in wild animal behavior monitoring we present MammAlps, a multimodal and multi-view dataset of wildlife behavior monitoring from 9 camera-traps in the Swiss National Park. MammAlps contains over 14 hours of video with audio, 2D segmentation maps and 8.5 hours of individual tracks densely labeled for species and behavior. Based on 6135 single animal clips, we propose the first hierarchical and multimodal animal behavior recognition benchmark using audio, video and reference scene segmentation maps as inputs. Furthermore, we also propose a second ecology-oriented benchmark aiming at identifying activities, species, number of individuals and meteorological conditions from 397 multi-view and long-term ecological events, including false positive triggers. We advocate that both tasks are complementary and contribute to bridging the gap between machine learning and ecology. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/eceo-epfl/MammAlps

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important molecular imaging tool widely used in medicine. Traditional PET systems rely on complete detector rings for full angular coverage and reliable data collection. However, incomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged due to hardware failures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. Standard reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance degradation with these systems because of reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies. We present a two-stage deep-learning framework that, without incorporating any time-of-flight (TOF) information, restores high-quality images from data with about 50% missing coincidences - double the loss levels previously addressed by CNN-based methods. The pipeline operates in two stages: a projection-domain Attention U-Net first predicts the missing sections of the sinogram by leveraging spatial context from neighbouring slices, after which the completed data are reconstructed with OSEM algorithm and passed to a U-Net-diffusion module that removes residual artefacts while reinstating high-frequency detail. Using 206 brain volumes from a public dataset, the result shows that our model successfully preserves most anatomical structures and tracer distribution features with PSNR of 30.92 dB and SSIM of 0.9708. We also achieve higher inference speed, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET imaging.

Abstract: We present Skywork R1V2, a next-generation multimodal reasoning model and a major leap forward from its predecessor, Skywork R1V. At its core, R1V2 introduces a hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that jointly leverages the Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) and the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which harmonizes reward-model guidance with rule-based strategies, thereby addressing the long-standing challenge of balancing sophisticated reasoning capabilities with broad generalization. To further enhance training efficiency, we propose the Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) mechanism, which effectively addresses the vanishing advantages dilemma inherent in GRPO by prioritizing high-value samples throughout the optimization process. Notably, we observe that excessive reinforcement signals can induce visual hallucinations--a phenomenon we systematically monitor and mitigate through calibrated reward thresholds throughout the training process. Empirical results affirm the exceptional capability of R1V2, with benchmark-leading performances such as 62.6 on OlympiadBench, 78.9 on AIME2024, 63.6 on LiveCodeBench, and 73.6 on MMMU. These results underscore R1V2's superiority over existing open-source models and demonstrate significant progress in closing the performance gap with premier proprietary systems, including Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI-o4-mini. The Skywork R1V2 model weights have been publicly released to promote openness and reproducibility https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-R1V2-38B.

Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for $\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation $\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.

<title>Flow-GRPO: Training Flow Matching Models via Online RL</title>

Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.

<title>Multi-Source Collaborative Style Augmentation and Domain-Invariant Learning for Federated Domain Generalization</title>

Abstract: Federated domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model from multiple decentralized source domains for deploying on the unseen target domain. The style augmentation methods have achieved great progress on domain generalization. However, the existing style augmentation methods either explore the data styles within isolated source domain or interpolate the style information across existing source domains under the data decentralization scenario, which leads to limited style space. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-source Collaborative Style Augmentation and Domain-invariant learning method (MCSAD) for federated domain generalization. Specifically, we propose a multi-source collaborative style augmentation module to generate data in the broader style space. Furthermore, we conduct domain-invariant learning between the original data and augmented data by cross-domain feature alignment within the same class and classes relation ensemble distillation between different classes to learn a domain-invariant model. By alternatively conducting collaborative style augmentation and domain-invariant learning, the model can generalize well on unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple domain generalization datasets indicate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated domain generalization methods.

<title>Exploring Sparsity for Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning Using Wavelets</title>

Abstract: Efficiently adapting large foundation models is critical, especially with tight compute and memory budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum, ideal for extreme parameter-efficient scenarios. Evaluated on personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline, WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and image diversity.

<title>ReactDiff: Latent Diffusion for Facial Reaction Generation</title>

Abstract: Given the audio-visual clip of the speaker, facial reaction generation aims to predict the listener's facial reactions. The challenge lies in capturing the relevance between video and audio while balancing appropriateness, realism, and diversity. While prior works have mostly focused on uni-modal inputs or simplified reaction mappings, recent approaches such as PerFRDiff have explored multi-modal inputs and the one-to-many nature of appropriate reaction mappings. In this work, we propose the Facial Reaction Diffusion (ReactDiff) framework that uniquely integrates a Multi-Modality Transformer with conditional diffusion in the latent space for enhanced reaction generation. Unlike existing methods, ReactDiff leverages intra- and inter-class attention for fine-grained multi-modal interaction, while the latent diffusion process between the encoder and decoder enables diverse yet contextually appropriate outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that ReactDiff significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a facial reaction correlation of 0.26 and diversity score of 0.094 while maintaining competitive realism. The code is open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/Hunan-Tiger/ReactDiff}{github}.

<title>Fact-R1: Towards Explainable Video Misinformation Detection with Deep Reasoning</title>

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

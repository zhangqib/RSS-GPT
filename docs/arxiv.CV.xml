Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) includes diverse tasks, from bone to organ segmentation, each with its own challenges in finding the best segmentation model. The state-of-the-art AutoML-related MIS-framework nnU-Net automates many aspects of model configuration but remains constrained by fixed hyperparameters and heuristic design choices. As a full-AutoML framework for MIS, we propose Auto-nnU-Net, a novel nnU-Net variant enabling hyperparameter optimization (HPO), neural architecture search (NAS), and hierarchical NAS (HNAS). Additionally, we propose Regularized PriorBand to balance model accuracy with the computational resources required for training, addressing the resource constraints often faced in real-world medical settings that limit the feasibility of extensive training procedures. We evaluate our approach across diverse MIS datasets from the well-established Medical Segmentation Decathlon, analyzing the impact of AutoML techniques on segmentation performance, computational efficiency, and model design choices. The results demonstrate that our AutoML approach substantially improves the segmentation performance of nnU-Net on 6 out of 10 datasets and is on par on the other datasets while maintaining practical resource requirements.

<div> concept erasure, diffusion models, evaluation framework, adversarial attacks, probing techniques

Summary:
Concept erasure in diffusion models is a subject of increasing interest, but the thoroughness of erasure methods remains unclear. The proposed erasure mechanisms include reducing the likelihood of generating the target concept and interfering with internal guidance mechanisms of the model. To assess the effectiveness of concept erasure, a suite of independent evaluation methods is introduced, including adversarial attacks, novel probing techniques, and analysis of alternative generations in place of the erased concept. The results highlight the balance between minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts. Comprehensive evaluation is crucial for understanding the efficacy of concept erasure in diffusion models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Concept erasure, the ability to selectively prevent a model from generating specific concepts, has attracted growing interest, with various approaches emerging to address the challenge. However, it remains unclear how thoroughly these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts. Broadly, our work underlines the importance of comprehensive evaluation for erasure in diffusion models.

Abstract: Referring Multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an important research field in computer vision. Its task form is to guide the models to track the objects that conform to the language instruction. However, the RMOT task commonly requires clear language instructions, such methods often fail to work when complex language instructions with reasoning characteristics appear. In this work, we propose a new task, called Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT). ReaMOT is a more challenging task that requires accurate reasoning about objects that match the language instruction with reasoning characteristic and tracking the objects' trajectories. To advance the ReaMOT task and evaluate the reasoning capabilities of tracking models, we construct ReaMOT Challenge, a reasoning-based multi-object tracking benchmark built upon 12 datasets. Specifically, it comprises 1,156 language instructions with reasoning characteristic, 423,359 image-language pairs, and 869 diverse scenes, which is divided into three levels of reasoning difficulty. In addition, we propose a set of evaluation metrics tailored for the ReaMOT task. Furthermore, we propose ReaTrack, a training-free framework for reasoning-based multi-object tracking based on large vision-language models (LVLM) and SAM2, as a baseline for the ReaMOT task. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models offer increased personalization opportunities in generative tasks. However, properly evaluating their results is challenging, and most of the existing metrics lag in terms of alignment with human judgment and explainability. To tackle these issues, we introduce DICE (DIfference Coherence Estimator), a model designed to detect localized differences between the original and the edited image and to assess their relevance to the given modification request. DICE consists of two key components: a difference detector and a coherence estimator, both built on an autoregressive Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and trained using a strategy that leverages self-supervision, distillation from inpainting networks, and full supervision. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate each stage of our pipeline, comparing different MLLMs within the proposed framework. We demonstrate that DICE effectively identifies coherent edits, effectively evaluating images generated by different editing models with a strong correlation with human judgment. We publicly release our source code, models, and data.

<div> Keywords: motion forecasting, multi-task learning, retrocausal flow, transformer model, trajectory modifications <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a multi-task learning method for motion forecasting that incorporates a retrocausal flow of information. By generating joint trajectory distributions using a transformer model, the method allows for better forecasting of interacting agents in a given scene. The approach utilizes compressed exponential power distributions to model positional uncertainty at each trajectory point. Results show that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Interaction Prediction dataset and generalizes well to the Argoverse 2 dataset. Additionally, the method offers an interface for issuing instructions through trajectory modifications, allowing for the adaptation of basic directional instructions to the context of the scene. Regular training with this method leads to the ability to follow goal-based instructions effectively. Overall, the proposed approach enhances motion forecasting by considering various constraints and interactive behaviors in dynamic environments. <div>

Abstract: Motion forecasts of road users (i.e., agents) vary in complexity as a function of scene constraints and interactive behavior. We address this with a multi-task learning method for motion forecasting that includes a retrocausal flow of information. The corresponding tasks are to forecast (1) marginal trajectory distributions for all modeled agents and (2) joint trajectory distributions for interacting agents. Using a transformer model, we generate the joint distributions by re-encoding marginal distributions followed by pairwise modeling. This incorporates a retrocausal flow of information from later points in marginal trajectories to earlier points in joint trajectories. Per trajectory point, we model positional uncertainty using compressed exponential power distributions. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in the Waymo Interaction Prediction dataset and generalizes well to the Argoverse 2 dataset. Additionally, our method provides an interface for issuing instructions through trajectory modifications. Our experiments show that regular training of motion forecasting leads to the ability to follow goal-based instructions and to adapt basic directional instructions to the scene context.

Summary:
The study introduces MMPerspective, a benchmark designed to assess multimodal large language models' understanding of perspective through various tasks. It includes real-world and synthetic image instances with question-answer pairs to evaluate vanishing point perception, perspective reasoning, and spatial consistency. The evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art models reveals limitations in compositional reasoning and spatial consistency under perturbations. Model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities show interesting patterns, highlighting both bottlenecks and benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective serves as a valuable testbed for diagnosing and improving spatial understanding in vision-language systems. <div>
arXiv:2505.20426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems. Resources available at: https://yunlong10.github.io/MMPerspective/

Summary: <br />
The article introduces DIPO, a framework for generating articulated 3D objects using a pair of images. The dual-image input provides motion information, aiding in predicting kinematic relationships between parts. A dual-image diffusion model is proposed to generate part layouts and joint parameters, while a Chain-of-Thought graph reasoner infers part connectivity. The LEGO-Art dataset expansion pipeline enriches the PartNet-Mobility dataset, leading to the creation of the PM-X dataset containing complex articulated objects. Extensive experiments show DIPO outperforming existing methods in both resting and articulated states, with enhanced generalization to diverse objects. The code and dataset will be shared with the community upon publication. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.20460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DIPO, a novel framework for the controllable generation of articulated 3D objects from a pair of images: one depicting the object in a resting state and the other in an articulated state. Compared to the single-image approach, our dual-image input imposes only a modest overhead for data collection, but at the same time provides important motion information, which is a reliable guide for predicting kinematic relationships between parts. Specifically, we propose a dual-image diffusion model that captures relationships between the image pair to generate part layouts and joint parameters. In addition, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based graph reasoner that explicitly infers part connectivity relationships. To further improve robustness and generalization on complex articulated objects, we develop a fully automated dataset expansion pipeline, name LEGO-Art, that enriches the diversity and complexity of PartNet-Mobility dataset. We propose PM-X, a large-scale dataset of complex articulated 3D objects, accompanied by rendered images, URDF annotations, and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIPO significantly outperforms existing baselines in both the resting state and the articulated state, while the proposed PM-X dataset further enhances generalization to diverse and structurally complex articulated objects. Our code and dataset will be released to the community upon publication.

<div> Keywords: 3D reconstruction, view-consistent semantic supervision, multi-view semantic cues, Contrastive Codebook Learning, CLIP 

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework, CCL-LGS, to address the challenge of cross-view semantic inconsistencies in 3D semantic understanding. By integrating multi-view semantic cues, the framework ensures view-consistent semantic supervision. The approach involves using a zero-shot tracker to align 2D masks generated by SAM and identify their corresponding categories. CLIP is then utilized to extract robust semantic encodings across views. The Contrastive Codebook Learning (CCL) module is employed to distill discriminative semantic features by ensuring intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. Unlike previous methods, CCL-LGS resolves semantic conflicts while maintaining category discriminability. Extensive experiments show that CCL-LGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of 3D semantic understanding. The project page for CCL-LGS is available at https://epsilontl.github.io/CCL-LGS/. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction techniques and vision-language models have fueled significant progress in 3D semantic understanding, a capability critical to robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality. However, methods that rely on 2D priors are prone to a critical challenge: cross-view semantic inconsistencies induced by occlusion, image blur, and view-dependent variations. These inconsistencies, when propagated via projection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields and introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic supervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach first employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and reliably identify their corresponding categories. Next, we utilize CLIP to extract robust semantic encodings across views. Finally, our Contrastive Codebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. In contrast to previous methods that directly apply CLIP to imperfect masks, our framework explicitly resolves semantic conflicts while preserving category discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL-LGS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at https://epsilontl.github.io/CCL-LGS/.

Summary:
WeatherEdit introduces a novel pipeline for generating realistic weather effects in 3D scenes with controllable types and severity. The approach consists of two components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. The editing process integrates multiple weather styles into a diffusion model for diverse effects in 2D image backgrounds, utilizing a Temporal-View attention mechanism for consistency across frames. Weather particles like snowflakes, raindrops, and fog are generated in reconstructed 3D scenes using a dynamic 4D Gaussian field and physical-based modeling for realistic representation and severity adjustments. Integration of the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene results in consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experimental results on driving datasets demonstrate the capability of WeatherEdit to generate diverse weather effects with precise control over condition severity, making it suitable for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather conditions.

arXiv:2505.20471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

Summary:<br />ControlTac is a novel framework for generating realistic tactile images based on physical priors, contact force, and contact position. It addresses the challenge of scaling tactile data collection by providing a controllable approach for data augmentation. By conditioning the generation of tactile images on a single reference image, the framework produces varied and physically plausible outputs, enabling effective scaling of tactile datasets. Experimental results demonstrate consistent gains in three downstream tasks, validating the utility of ControlTac in real-world applications. The framework offers a promising solution for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of tactile data collection and manipulation in robotic systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.20498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensing has been widely used in perception, reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. However, collecting large-scale tactile data remains costly due to the localized nature of sensor-object interactions and inconsistencies across sensor instances. Existing approaches to scaling tactile data, such as simulation and free-form tactile generation, often suffer from unrealistic output and poor transferability to downstream tasks.To address this, we propose ControlTac, a two-stage controllable framework that generates realistic tactile images conditioned on a single reference tactile image, contact force, and contact position. With those physical priors as control input, ControlTac generates physically plausible and varied tactile images that can be used for effective data augmentation. Through experiments on three downstream tasks, we demonstrate that ControlTac can effectively augment tactile datasets and lead to consistent gains. Our three real-world experiments further validate the practical utility of our approach. Project page: https://dongyuluo.github.io/controltac.

Abstract: The global challenge of sustainable recycling demands automated, fast, and accurate, state-of-the-art (SOTA) material detection systems that act as a bedrock for a circular economy. Democratizing access to these cutting-edge solutions that enable real-time waste analysis is essential for scaling up recycling efforts and fostering the Green Deal. In response, we introduce \textbf{Electrolyzers-HSI}, a novel multimodal benchmark dataset designed to accelerate the recovery of critical raw materials through accurate electrolyzer materials classification. The dataset comprises 55 co-registered high-resolution RGB images and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data cubes spanning the 400--2500 nm spectral range, yielding over 4.2 million pixel vectors and 424,169 labeled ones. This enables non-invasive spectral analysis of shredded electrolyzer samples, supporting quantitative and qualitative material classification and spectral properties investigation. We evaluate a suite of baseline machine learning (ML) methods alongside SOTA transformer-based deep learning (DL) architectures, including Vision Transformer, SpectralFormer, and the Multimodal Fusion Transformer, to investigate architectural bottlenecks for further efficiency optimisation when deploying transformers in material identification. We implement zero-shot detection techniques and majority voting across pixel-level predictions to establish object-level classification robustness.

arXiv:2505.20510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of numerous foundation models. However, these approaches fail to replicate the diagnostic process of pathologists, as they either simply rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for classification or directly apply multimodal models to generate reports from images. A significant limitation is their inability to emulate the diagnostic logic employed by pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification for overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based model that mimics pathologists' reasoning processes by autonomously executing zoom-in/out and navigation operations across pathology images based on observed visual features. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy unifying patch-level, region-level, and whole-slide capabilities within a single model, which is essential for mimicking pathologists, who require understanding and reasoning capabilities across all three scales. This approach generates substantially more detailed and interpretable diagnostic reports compared to existing methods, particularly for huge region understanding. Additionally, we construct an expert-validated PathMMU-HR$^{2}$, the first benchmark for huge region analysis, a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, as diagnosticians typically examine several key regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across three scales of benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for the future development of computational pathology.

<div> bias evaluation, Facial Expression Recognition, demographic biases, statistical testing, network architecture 

Summary: 
This article introduces a feature-level bias evaluation framework for assessing demographic biases in Facial Expression Recognition (FER) models without the need for demographic labels in the test set. The framework outperforms existing methods using pseudo-demographic labels and includes a statistical module to ensure the significance of bias evaluation results. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale dataset reveal significant demographic biases in FER models across age, gender, and race attributes, as well as insights on selecting fairer network architectures. The study highlights the limitations of previous bias analysis methods and emphasizes the importance of statistical testing in evaluating biases in FER models. <div>
arXiv:2505.20512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on fairness have shown that Facial Expression Recognition (FER) models exhibit biases toward certain visually perceived demographic groups. However, the limited availability of human-annotated demographic labels in public FER datasets has constrained the scope of such bias analysis. To overcome this limitation, some prior works have resorted to pseudo-demographic labels, which may distort bias evaluation results. Alternatively, in this paper, we propose a feature-level bias evaluation framework for evaluating demographic biases in FER models under the setting where demographic labels are unavailable in the test set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method more effectively evaluates demographic biases compared to existing approaches that rely on pseudo-demographic labels. Furthermore, we observe that many existing studies do not include statistical testing in their bias evaluations, raising concerns that some reported biases may not be statistically significant but rather due to randomness. To address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play statistical module to ensure the statistical significance of biased evaluation results. A comprehensive bias analysis based on the proposed module is then conducted across three sensitive attributes (age, gender, and race), seven facial expressions, and multiple network architectures on a large-scale dataset, revealing the prominent demographic biases in FER and providing insights on selecting a fairer network architecture.

<div> personalized handwritten text recognition, HTR, self-supervised learning, meta-learning, prompt tuning 

Summary: 
This article introduces a new approach for personalized handwritten text recognition (HTR) that addresses the challenge of recognizing diverse writing styles. The proposed framework utilizes prompt tuning and self-supervised learning to personalize the HTR model at test time without the need for labeled examples. By incorporating an auxiliary image reconstruction task and leveraging meta-learning to optimize prompt initialization, the model efficiently adapts to unique writing styles by updating less than 1% of its parameters. The method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets while using significantly fewer parameters, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios. This advancement in personalized HTR offers a more reliable and practical solution for converting handwritten text into digital formats, demonstrating the potential for improved performance in diverse writing style recognition.

Abstract: Recent advancements in handwritten text recognition (HTR) have enabled the effective conversion of handwritten text to digital formats. However, achieving robust recognition across diverse writing styles remains challenging. Traditional HTR methods lack writer-specific personalization at test time due to limitations in model architecture and training strategies. Existing attempts to bridge this gap, through gradient-based meta-learning, still require labeled examples and suffer from parameter-inefficient fine-tuning, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient framework that formulates personalization as prompt tuning, incorporating an auxiliary image reconstruction task with a self-supervised loss to guide prompt adaptation with unlabeled test-time examples. To ensure self-supervised loss effectively minimizes text recognition error, we leverage meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization of the prompts. As a result, our method allows the model to efficiently capture unique writing styles by updating less than 1% of its parameters and eliminating the need for time-intensive annotation processes. We validate our approach on the RIMES and IAM Handwriting Database benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while using 20x fewer parameters. We believe this represents a significant advancement in personalized handwritten text recognition, paving the way for more reliable and practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

<div> adaptation, LoRA, generative models, MultLFG, frequency-domain

Summary:
MultLFG introduces a framework for training-free multi-LoRA composition, utilizing frequency-domain guidance for adaptive fusion of multiple LoRAs. Unlike existing methods, MultLFG employs a selective activation strategy based on relevance at specific timesteps and frequency bands. This frequency-sensitive guidance enhances spatial coherence and provides finer control over multi-LoRA composition, resulting in more accurate and consistent results. Experimental evaluations on the ComposLoRA benchmark demonstrate that MultLFG significantly improves compositional fidelity and image quality across various styles and concept sets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in multi-concept generation tasks. Code for the framework will be made available for further research and experimentation.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained prominence as a computationally efficient method for fine-tuning generative models, enabling distinct visual concept synthesis with minimal overhead. However, current methods struggle to effectively merge multiple LoRA adapters without training, particularly in complex compositions involving diverse visual elements. We introduce MultLFG, a novel framework for training-free multi-LoRA composition that utilizes frequency-domain guidance to achieve adaptive fusion of multiple LoRAs. Unlike existing methods that uniformly aggregate concept-specific LoRAs, MultLFG employs a timestep and frequency subband adaptive fusion strategy, selectively activating relevant LoRAs based on content relevance at specific timesteps and frequency bands. This frequency-sensitive guidance not only improves spatial coherence but also provides finer control over multi-LoRA composition, leading to more accurate and consistent results. Experimental evaluations on the ComposLoRA benchmark reveal that MultLFG substantially enhances compositional fidelity and image quality across various styles and concept sets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in multi-concept generation tasks. Code will be released.

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) remains brittle in real-world deployments despite impressive benchmark performance. Most existing models rely on superficial correlations such as clothing, background, or lighting that fail to generalize across domains, viewpoints, and temporal variations. This survey examines the emerging role of causal reasoning as a principled alternative to traditional correlation-based approaches in video-based Re-ID. We provide a structured and critical analysis of methods that leverage structural causal models, interventions, and counterfactual reasoning to isolate identity-specific features from confounding factors. The survey is organized around a novel taxonomy of causal Re-ID methods that spans generative disentanglement, domain-invariant modeling, and causal transformers. We review current evaluation metrics and introduce causal-specific robustness measures. In addition, we assess practical challenges of scalability, fairness, interpretability, and privacy that must be addressed for real-world adoption. Finally, we identify open problems and outline future research directions that integrate causal modeling with efficient architectures and self-supervised learning. This survey aims to establish a coherent foundation for causal video-based person Re-ID and to catalyze the next phase of research in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Face reenactment and portrait relighting are essential tasks in portrait editing, yet they are typically addressed independently, without much synergy. Most face reenactment methods prioritize motion control and multiview consistency, while portrait relighting focuses on adjusting shading effects. To take advantage of both geometric consistency and illumination awareness, we introduce Total-Editing, a unified portrait editing framework that enables precise control over appearance, motion, and lighting. Specifically, we design a neural radiance field decoder with intrinsic decomposition capabilities. This allows seamless integration of lighting information from portrait images or HDR environment maps into synthesized portraits. We also incorporate a moving least squares based deformation field to enhance the spatiotemporal coherence of avatar motion and shading effects. With these innovations, our unified framework significantly improves the quality and realism of portrait editing results. Further, the multi-source nature of Total-Editing supports more flexible applications, such as illumination transfer from one portrait to another, or portrait animation with customized backgrounds.

Summary: 
OmniIndoor3D is a novel framework for indoor 3D reconstruction using Gaussian representations. It combines multiple RGB-D images to create a coarse 3D reconstruction, then uses 3D Gaussians to improve geometry for high-quality panoptic reconstruction. A lightweight MLP helps adjust geometric properties to reduce noise in indoor scenes. A densification strategy guided by panoptic priors smoothes planar surfaces. By jointly optimizing appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction, OmniIndoor3D provides comprehensive 3D scene understanding for accurate robotic navigation. Thorough evaluations across datasets show state-of-the-art results in appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction. This work fills a critical gap in indoor 3D reconstruction. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for comprehensive indoor 3D reconstruction using Gaussian representations, called OmniIndoor3D. This framework enables accurate appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction of diverse indoor scenes captured by a consumer-level RGB-D camera. Since 3DGS is primarily optimized for photorealistic rendering, it lacks the precise geometry critical for high-quality panoptic reconstruction. Therefore, OmniIndoor3D first combines multiple RGB-D images to create a coarse 3D reconstruction, which is then used to initialize the 3D Gaussians and guide the 3DGS training. To decouple the optimization conflict between appearance and geometry, we introduce a lightweight MLP that adjusts the geometric properties of 3D Gaussians. The introduced lightweight MLP serves as a low-pass filter for geometry reconstruction and significantly reduces noise in indoor scenes. To improve the distribution of Gaussian primitives, we propose a densification strategy guided by panoptic priors to encourage smoothness on planar surfaces. Through the joint optimization of appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction, OmniIndoor3D provides comprehensive 3D indoor scene understanding, which facilitates accurate and robust robotic navigation. We perform thorough evaluations across multiple datasets, and OmniIndoor3D achieves state-of-the-art results in appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction. We believe our work bridges a critical gap in indoor 3D reconstruction. The code will be released at: https://ucwxb.github.io/OmniIndoor3D/

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework to improve Transformer-based methods for 3-D human pose estimation. The framework addresses the computational challenges faced by such methods by incorporating the Bone Aware Module, which provides topological guidance for processing joint sequences. Additionally, the integration of forward and backward graph convolutional networks enhances the convolutional structure within the Mamba model to better capture local joint dependencies.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based methods for 3-D human pose estimation face significant computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM). However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3-D joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.

Summary: 
Roboflow100-VL introduces a collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly included in VLM pre-training. The study evaluates state-of-the-art VLMs on the benchmark in various settings - zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised, providing a comparison across data regimes. The results show that even advanced VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL struggle to achieve high zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, highlighting the importance of few-shot concept alignment. This research emphasizes the need to align VLMs to new concepts using annotation instructions containing visual examples and textual descriptions rather than solely relying on re-training with more visual data. The code and dataset for Roboflow100-VL are available on GitHub, offering a valuable resource for advancing the generalization capabilities of VLMs. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment.

Summary: 
This study addresses the challenge of predicting hypertension development in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) using a novel deep learning approach. By integrating Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based transfer learning and incorporating all polysomnography signals for hypertension prediction, the model leverages collective information to enhance accuracy. Features extracted from the signals are transformed into a 2D representation and processed through pre-trained 2D neural networks such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet variants. The introduction of a DCT layer further enhances feature learning by preserving spectral information and improving noise robustness. By strategically placing the DCT layer within the EfficientNet architecture, the model achieved a high area under the curve (AUC) of 72.88%, demonstrating the effectiveness of frequency-domain feature extraction and transfer learning in predicting hypertension risk in OSA patients over a five-year period. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a significant risk factor for hypertension, primarily due to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. Predicting whether individuals with OSA will develop hypertension within five years remains a complex challenge. This study introduces a novel deep learning approach that integrates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based transfer learning to enhance prediction accuracy. We are the first to incorporate all polysomnography signals together for hypertension prediction, leveraging their collective information to improve model performance. Features were extracted from these signals and transformed into a 2D representation to utilize pre-trained 2D neural networks such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet variants. To further improve feature learning, we introduced a DCT layer, which transforms input features into a frequency-based representation, preserving essential spectral information, decorrelating features, and enhancing robustness to noise. This frequency-domain approach, coupled with transfer learning, is especially beneficial for limited medical datasets, as it leverages rich representations from pre-trained networks to improve generalization. By strategically placing the DCT layer at deeper truncation depths within EfficientNet, our model achieved a best area under the curve (AUC) of 72.88%, demonstrating the effectiveness of frequency-domain feature extraction and transfer learning in predicting hypertension risk in OSA patients over a five-year period.

Summary:
OccLE is a new approach for label-efficient 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving perception. It decouples semantic and geometric learning tasks to optimize performance with limited voxel annotations. The semantic branch utilizes a 2D foundation model to generate aligned pseudo labels for 2D and 3D semantic learning. The geometric branch combines image and LiDAR inputs through semi-supervision to enhance geometry learning. The fusion of semantic-geometric feature grids is achieved through Dual Mamba, with scatter-accumulated projection for supervising unannotated predictions with aligned pseudo labels. OccLE achieves competitive performance with only 10% of voxel annotations, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 16.59% on the SemanticKITTI validation set.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an intuitive and efficient scene understanding and has attracted significant interest in autonomous driving perception. Existing approaches either rely on full supervision, which demands costly voxel-level annotations, or on self-supervision, which provides limited guidance and yields suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose OccLE, a Label-Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction that takes images and LiDAR as inputs and maintains high performance with limited voxel annotations. Our intuition is to decouple the semantic and geometric learning tasks and then fuse the learned feature grids from both tasks for the final semantic occupancy prediction. Therefore, the semantic branch distills 2D foundation model to provide aligned pseudo labels for 2D and 3D semantic learning. The geometric branch integrates image and LiDAR inputs in cross-plane synergy based on their inherency, employing semi-supervision to enhance geometry learning. We fuse semantic-geometric feature grids through Dual Mamba and incorporate a scatter-accumulated projection to supervise unannotated prediction with aligned pseudo labels. Experiments show that OccLE achieves competitive performance with only 10% of voxel annotations, reaching a mIoU of 16.59% on the SemanticKITTI validation set.

This article introduces a novel training-free method for achieving consistent character generation in text-to-image models.

The proposed approach manipulates attention matrices to anchor subject-specific Queries and Keys while incorporating style-agnostic Values from parallel copies.

Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in preserving subject characteristics and aligning with textual descriptions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In text-to-image models, consistent character generation is the task of achieving text alignment while maintaining the subject's appearance across different prompts. However, since style and appearance are often entangled, the existing methods struggle to preserve consistent subject characteristics while adhering to varying style prompts. Current approaches for consistent text-to-image generation typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning on curated image sets or per-subject optimization, which either fail to generalize across prompts or do not align well with textual descriptions. Meanwhile, training-free methods often fail to maintain subject consistency across different styles. In this work, we introduce a training-free method that achieves both style alignment and subject consistency. The attention matrices are manipulated such that Queries and Keys are obtained from the anchor image(s) that are used to define the subject, while the Values are imported from a parallel copy that is not subject-anchored. Additionally, cross-image components are added to the self-attention mechanism by expanding the Key and Value matrices. To do without shifting from the target style, we align the statistics of the Value matrices. As is demonstrated in a comprehensive battery of qualitative and quantitative experiments, our method effectively decouples style from subject appearance and enables faithful generation of text-aligned images with consistent characters across diverse styles.

Summary:
FlexTI2V introduces a unified formulation for flexible text-image-to-video generation. The approach allows conditioning T2V models on multiple images at various positions without the need for training. By inverting condition images to noisy representations in a latent space and incorporating visual features via random patch swapping during the denoising process, the method achieves a balance between creativity and fidelity. A dynamic control mechanism adjusts the visual conditioning strength for individual video frames.

arXiv:2505.20629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-image-to-video (TI2V) generation is a critical problem for controllable video generation using both semantic and visual conditions. Most existing methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few predefined conditioning settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a unified formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models, our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual features into video representations through local image patches. To balance creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning methods by a notable margin. We also show more insights of our method by detailed ablation study and analysis.

Summary:
The study compared skin tone classification methods for facial affect analysis (FAA) systems, using Individual Typology Angle (ITA) and a perceptually grounded method based on Lightness ($L^*$) and Hue ($H^*$). Fairness disparities were found across skin tone groups, with dark skin tones being severely underrepresented. The $H^*$-$L^*$ method provided more consistent subgrouping and clearer diagnostics, revealing disparities that the ITA method may overlook. Model attention patterns varied by skin tone, suggesting differences in feature encoding. A modular fairness-aware pipeline was proposed to integrate skin tone estimation, model interpretability, and fairness evaluation for future mitigation efforts. These findings highlight the importance of skin tone measurement in fairness assessment and suggest the need for more inclusive evaluations in FAA systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how facial affect analysis (FAA) systems perform across different demographic groups requires reliable measurement of sensitive attributes such as ancestry, often approximated by skin tone, which itself is highly influenced by lighting conditions. This study compares two objective skin tone classification methods: the widely used Individual Typology Angle (ITA) and a perceptually grounded alternative based on Lightness ($L^*$) and Hue ($H^*$). Using AffectNet and a MobileNet-based model, we assess fairness across skin tone groups defined by each method. Results reveal a severe underrepresentation of dark skin tones ($\sim 2 \%$), alongside fairness disparities in F1-score (up to 0.08) and TPR (up to 0.11) across groups. While ITA shows limitations due to its sensitivity to lighting, the $H^*$-$L^*$ method yields more consistent subgrouping and enables clearer diagnostics through metrics such as Equal Opportunity. Grad-CAM analysis further highlights differences in model attention patterns by skin tone, suggesting variation in feature encoding. To support future mitigation efforts, we also propose a modular fairness-aware pipeline that integrates perceptual skin tone estimation, model interpretability, and fairness evaluation. These findings emphasize the relevance of skin tone measurement choices in fairness assessment and suggest that ITA-based evaluations may overlook disparities affecting darker-skinned individuals.

<div> detect objects, category names, open-ended object detection, efficient training, vision-language alignment<br />
Summary:<br />
Open-Det is introduced as a novel and efficient framework for Open-Ended object Detection (OED). It accelerates model training for both bounding box and object name generation by reconstructing the Object Detector and Object Name Generator. To bridge the gap between Vision and Language, Open-Det includes a Vision-Language Aligner with alignment mechanisms and a Prompts Distiller for accurate object name generation. It uses a Masked Alignment Loss to remove contradictory supervision and a Joint Loss to enhance classification for more efficient training. Comparing to GenerateU, Open-Det achieves higher performance with significantly less training data, training epochs, and GPU resources. The results show a 1.0% improvement in Average Precision (APr) while utilizing only 1.5% of the training data, 20.8% of the training epochs, and fewer GPU resources. <div>

Abstract: Open-Ended object Detection (OED) is a novel and challenging task that detects objects and generates their category names in a free-form manner, without requiring additional vocabularies during inference. However, the existing OED models, such as GenerateU, require large-scale datasets for training, suffer from slow convergence, and exhibit limited performance. To address these issues, we present a novel and efficient Open-Det framework, consisting of four collaborative parts. Specifically, Open-Det accelerates model training in both the bounding box and object name generation process by reconstructing the Object Detector and the Object Name Generator. To bridge the semantic gap between Vision and Language modalities, we propose a Vision-Language Aligner with V-to-L and L-to-V alignment mechanisms, incorporating with the Prompts Distiller to transfer knowledge from the VLM into VL-prompts, enabling accurate object name generation for the LLM. In addition, we design a Masked Alignment Loss to eliminate contradictory supervision and introduce a Joint Loss to enhance classification, resulting in more efficient training. Compared to GenerateU, Open-Det, using only 1.5% of the training data (0.077M vs. 5.077M), 20.8% of the training epochs (31 vs. 149), and fewer GPU resources (4 V100 vs. 16 A100), achieves even higher performance (+1.0% in APr).

Built upon the NVIDIA Isaac Sim platform, IndustryEQA provides high-fidelity episodic memory videos featuring diverse industrial assets, dynamic human agents, and carefully designed hazardous situations inspired by real-world safety guidelines. The benchmark includes rich annotations covering six categories: equipment safety, human safety, object recognition, attribute recognition, temporal understanding, and spatial understanding. Besides, it also provides extra reasoning evaluation based on these categories. Specifically, it comprises 971 question-answer pairs generated from small warehouse and 373 pairs from large ones, incorporating scenarios with and without human. We further propose a comprehensive evaluation framework, including various baseline models, to assess their general perception and reasoning abilities in industrial environments.

Summary:
LIAR is a novel framework designed for occupancy prediction in challenging nighttime scenarios. It introduces Selective Low-light Image Enhancement (SLLIE) to adaptively enhance nighttime images based on illumination priors from daytime scenes. The framework incorporates 2D Illumination-guided Sampling (2D-IGS) to address feature degradation in dark regions by adjusting feature sampling positions according to illumination maps. Additionally, 3D Illumination-driven Projection (3D-IDP) enhances semantic understanding in overexposed areas by constructing illumination intensity fields. LIAR demonstrates superior performance in nighttime scenarios through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets. The source code and pretrained models are available for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Occupancy prediction aims to estimate the 3D spatial distribution of occupied regions along with their corresponding semantic labels. Existing vision-based methods perform well on daytime benchmarks but struggle in nighttime scenarios due to limited visibility and challenging lighting conditions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LIAR}, a novel framework that learns illumination-affined representations. LIAR first introduces Selective Low-light Image Enhancement (SLLIE), which leverages the illumination priors from daytime scenes to adaptively determine whether a nighttime image is genuinely dark or sufficiently well-lit, enabling more targeted global enhancement. Building on the illumination maps generated by SLLIE, LIAR further incorporates two illumination-aware components: 2D Illumination-guided Sampling (2D-IGS) and 3D Illumination-driven Projection (3D-IDP), to respectively tackle local underexposure and overexposure. Specifically, 2D-IGS modulates feature sampling positions according to illumination maps, assigning larger offsets to darker regions and smaller ones to brighter regions, thereby alleviating feature degradation in underexposed areas. Subsequently, 3D-IDP enhances semantic understanding in overexposed regions by constructing illumination intensity fields and supplying refined residual queries to the BEV context refinement process. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LIAR under challenging nighttime scenarios. The source code and pretrained models are available \href{https://github.com/yanzq95/LIAR}{here}.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach, named Scan-and-Print, for content-aware layout generation in AI-empowered poster design. This approach addresses the challenge of high parameter count and limited training data by utilizing patch-level data summarization and augmentation techniques. The scan procedure efficiently selects patches suitable for placing element vertices, while the print procedure synthesizes new samples by mixing patches and vertices across image-layout pairs. A vertex-based layout representation is introduced to facilitate vertex-level operations. Experimental results show that Scan-and-Print can generate visually appealing layouts with state-of-the-art quality while significantly reducing computational bottleneck by 95.2%. This innovative approach enhances the model's real-time performance and generalization ability, making it a promising solution for improving content-aware layout generation in poster design. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In AI-empowered poster design, content-aware layout generation is crucial for the on-image arrangement of visual-textual elements, e.g., logo, text, and underlay. To perceive the background images, existing work demanded a high parameter count that far exceeds the size of available training data, which has impeded the model's real-time performance and generalization ability. To address these challenges, we proposed a patch-level data summarization and augmentation approach, vividly named Scan-and-Print. Specifically, the scan procedure selects only the patches suitable for placing element vertices to perform fine-grained perception efficiently. Then, the print procedure mixes up the patches and vertices across two image-layout pairs to synthesize over 100% new samples in each epoch while preserving their plausibility. Besides, to facilitate the vertex-level operations, a vertex-based layout representation is introduced. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks demonstrated that Scan-and-Print can generate visually appealing layouts with state-of-the-art quality while dramatically reducing computational bottleneck by 95.2%.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel learning objective for domain generalization in deepfake detection. The proposed method aligns generalization gradient updates with empirical risk minimization (ERM) gradient updates by perturbing model parameters. This alignment enhances the model's robustness to domain shifts without the need for additional regularization. Experimental results on various deepfake detection datasets show that the gradient alignment strategy outperforms existing domain generalization techniques. The code for the method is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>
arXiv:2505.20653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in domain generalization for deepfake detection have attracted significant attention, with previous methods often incorporating additional modules to prevent overfitting to domain-specific patterns. However, such regularization can hinder the optimization of the empirical risk minimization (ERM) objective, ultimately degrading model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning objective that aligns generalization gradient updates with ERM gradient updates. The key innovation is the application of perturbations to model parameters, aligning the ascending points across domains, which specifically enhances the robustness of deepfake detection models to domain shifts. This approach effectively preserves domain-invariant features while managing domain-specific characteristics, without introducing additional regularization. Experimental results on multiple challenging deepfake detection datasets demonstrate that our gradient alignment strategy outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques, confirming the efficacy of our method.

Summary:
An automated framework for building photography perspective composition (PPC) datasets using expert photographs is proposed to address the limitations of traditional cropping-based methods. A video generation approach demonstrates the transformation process from suboptimal to optimal perspectives, inspired by professional photographers' 3D recomposition techniques. Additionally, a perspective quality assessment (PQA) model is developed based on human performance to evaluate the quality of perspective adjustments. The framework aims to help ordinary users enhance their composition skills without the need for additional instructions or camera trajectories. <div>

Abstract: Traditional photography composition approaches are dominated by 2D cropping-based methods. However, these methods fall short when scenes contain poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that demonstrates the transformation process from suboptimal to optimal perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users to enhance their composition skills.

The paper introduces AutoDriveRL, a training framework for autonomous driving that focuses on structured reasoning across perception, prediction, planning, and behavior. Autonomous driving tasks are formulated as vision-language question-answering problems within this framework, with task-specific reward models optimizing each task independently. DriveRX, a vision-language model designed for real-time decision-making, is trained using this framework and outperforms GPT-4o in behavior reasoning on a public benchmark. The study emphasizes the importance of vision encoder design and reward-guided reasoning compression in achieving strong performance in complex driving scenarios. The authors plan to release the AutoDriveRL framework and the DriveRX model to support further research in autonomous driving. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.20665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires real-time, robust reasoning across perception, prediction, planning, and behavior. However, conventional end-to-end models fail to generalize in complex scenarios due to the lack of structured reasoning. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have been applied to driving tasks, but they typically rely on isolated modules and static supervision, limiting their ability to support multi-stage decision-making. We present AutoDriveRL, a unified training framework that formulates autonomous driving as a structured reasoning process over four core tasks. Each task is independently modeled as a vision-language question-answering problem and optimized using task-specific reward models, enabling fine-grained reinforcement signals at different reasoning stages. Within this framework, we train DriveRX, a cross-task reasoning VLM designed for real-time decision-making. DriveRX achieves strong performance on a public benchmark, outperforming GPT-4o in behavior reasoning and demonstrating robustness under complex or corrupted driving conditions. Our analysis further highlights the impact of vision encoder design and reward-guided reasoning compression. We will release the AutoDriveRL framework and the DriveRX model to support future research.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new cross-domain face forgery detection method that is designed to be robust against various forgery methods while maintaining a low false positive rate. Existing detection methods often suffer from high false alarm rates, impacting system usability. The proposed Contrastive Desensitization Network (CDN) utilizes a robust desensitization algorithm to learn domain characteristics through genuine face image pairs. The learned representation is theoretically justified for robustness against domain changes. Extensive experiments on large datasets show that the CDN method significantly reduces false alarms and improves detection accuracy compared to current methods. This approach addresses the issue of false positives in face forgery detection and enhances the overall effectiveness of forgery detection systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new cross-domain face forgery detection method that is insensitive to different and possibly unseen forgery methods while ensuring an acceptable low false positive rate. Although existing face forgery detection methods are applicable to multiple domains to some degree, they often come with a high false positive rate, which can greatly disrupt the usability of the system. To address this issue, we propose an Contrastive Desensitization Network (CDN) based on a robust desensitization algorithm, which captures the essential domain characteristics through learning them from domain transformation over pairs of genuine face images. One advantage of CDN lies in that the learnt face representation is theoretical justified with regard to the its robustness against the domain changes. Extensive experiments over large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a much lower false alarm rate with improved detection accuracy compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Student engagement plays a crucial role in the successful delivery of educational programs. Automated engagement measurement helps instructors monitor student participation, identify disengagement, and adapt their teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes effectively. This paper identifies two key challenges in this problem: class imbalance and incorporating order into engagement levels rather than treating it as mere categories. Then, a novel approach to video-based student engagement measurement in virtual learning environments is proposed that utilizes supervised contrastive learning for ordinal classification of engagement. Various affective and behavioral features are extracted from video samples and utilized to train ordinal classifiers within a supervised contrastive learning framework (with a sequential classifier as the encoder). A key step involves the application of diverse time-series data augmentation techniques to these feature vectors, enhancing model training. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using a publicly available dataset for engagement measurement, DAiSEE, containing videos of students who participated in virtual learning programs. The results demonstrate the robust ability of the proposed method for the classification of the engagement level. This approach promises a significant contribution to understanding and enhancing student engagement in virtual learning environments.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a concise Continual Learning (CL) approach for the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model. The method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), utilizes textual prototypes as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, leading to more effective knowledge acquisition and reduced forgetting. By optimizing both visual and textual prompts, TPPT-VT further enhances adaptation capabilities. A relational diversity regularization is introduced to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, which leverages CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation. This streamlined approach eliminates unnecessary complexity present in existing methods, maximizing the utilization of CLIP's capabilities for continual learning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables deep networks to acquire new knowledge while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The powerful generalization ability of pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight, incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e., TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.

Summary: 
Dataset distillation has been successful in compressing image datasets, but extending it to videos presents challenges due to the higher dimensionality and temporal complexity. Current Video Distillation methods struggle with computational costs and preserving temporal dynamics. A novel uni-level video dataset distillation framework proposed in this paper directly optimizes synthetic videos with a pre-trained model.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for dataset compression, enabling the synthesis of compact surrogate datasets that approximate the training utility of large-scale ones. While significant progress has been achieved in distilling image datasets, extending DD to the video domain remains challenging due to the high dimensionality and temporal complexity inherent in video data. Existing video distillation (VD) methods often suffer from excessive computational costs and struggle to preserve temporal dynamics, as na\"ive extensions of image-based approaches typically lead to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a novel uni-level video dataset distillation framework that directly optimizes synthetic videos with respect to a pre-trained model. To address temporal redundancy and enhance motion preservation, we introduce a temporal saliency-guided filtering mechanism that leverages inter-frame differences to guide the distillation process, encouraging the retention of informative temporal cues while suppressing frame-level redundancy. Extensive experiments on standard video benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, bridging the gap between real and distilled video data and offering a scalable solution for video dataset compression.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel method called ReCAP for Wild Test-Time Adaptation (WTTA) that aims to adapt a source model to unseen domains under extreme data scarcity and multiple shifts. The authors identify limitations in the widely-adopted entropy minimization framework in WTTA and propose region confidence as a superior alternative. However, direct optimization of region confidence is computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, they develop ReCAP, which uses a probabilistic region modeling scheme to capture semantic changes in the embedding space. They also introduce a finite-to-infinite asymptotic approximation to transform the intractable region confidence into a tractable and upper-bounded proxy. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of ReCAP over existing methods across various datasets and wild scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Wild Test-Time Adaptation (WTTA) is proposed to adapt a source model to unseen domains under extreme data scarcity and multiple shifts. Previous approaches mainly focused on sample selection strategies, while overlooking the fundamental problem on underlying optimization. Initially, we critically analyze the widely-adopted entropy minimization framework in WTTA and uncover its significant limitations in noisy optimization dynamics that substantially hinder adaptation efficiency. Through our analysis, we identify region confidence as a superior alternative to traditional entropy, however, its direct optimization remains computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel region-integrated method ReCAP that bypasses the lengthy process. Specifically, we propose a probabilistic region modeling scheme that flexibly captures semantic changes in embedding space. Subsequently, we develop a finite-to-infinite asymptotic approximation that transforms the intractable region confidence into a tractable and upper-bounded proxy. These innovations significantly unlock the overlooked potential dynamics in local region in a concise solution. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of ReCAP over existing methods across various datasets and wild scenarios.

Summary:
Hierarchical Instruction-aware Embodied Visual Tracking (HIEVT) addresses the challenge of bridging high-level user instructions and low-level agent actions in User-Centric Embodied Visual Tracking tasks. The approach utilizes a Semantic-Spatial Goal Aligner powered by language models to translate human instructions into spatial goals, followed by an RL-based Adaptive Goal-Aligned Policy for executing actions. HIEVT is tested on diverse environments, demonstrating robustness and generalizability across various scenarios. The project offers a valuable contribution to improving reinforcement learning-based models for Embodied Visual Tracking tasks. <div>

Abstract: User-Centric Embodied Visual Tracking (UC-EVT) presents a novel challenge for reinforcement learning-based models due to the substantial gap between high-level user instructions and low-level agent actions. While recent advancements in language models (e.g., LLMs, VLMs, VLAs) have improved instruction comprehension, these models face critical limitations in either inference speed (LLMs, VLMs) or generalizability (VLAs) for UC-EVT tasks. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hierarchical Instruction-aware Embodied Visual Tracking (HIEVT)} agent, which bridges instruction comprehension and action generation using \textit{spatial goals} as intermediaries. HIEVT first introduces \textit{LLM-based Semantic-Spatial Goal Aligner} to translate diverse human instructions into spatial goals that directly annotate the desired spatial position. Then the \textit{RL-based Adaptive Goal-Aligned Policy}, a general offline policy, enables the tracker to position the target as specified by the spatial goal. To benchmark UC-EVT tasks, we collect over ten million trajectories for training and evaluate across one seen environment and nine unseen challenging environments. Extensive experiments and real-world deployments demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of HIEVT across diverse environments, varying target dynamics, and complex instruction combinations.

Abstract: Video temporal understanding is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason over events in videos. Despite recent advances in general video understanding, current MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained temporal reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to address this issue recently, existing RL approaches remain limited in effectiveness. In this work, we propose MUSEG, a novel RL-based method that enhances temporal understanding by introducing timestamp-aware multi-segment grounding. MUSEG enables MLLMs to align queries with multiple relevant video segments, promoting more comprehensive temporal reasoning. To facilitate effective learning, we design a customized RL training recipe with phased rewards that progressively guides the model toward temporally grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments on temporal grounding and time-sensitive video QA tasks demonstrate that MUSEG significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse temporal understanding scenarios.

<div> Flow Matching, Diffusion Models, Image Generation, Learned Distribution, ODE Solver <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel approach, Learned Distribution-guided Flow Matching (LeDiFlow), for training high-quality image generation models based on Flow Matching (FM). LeDiFlow utilizes a better-suited prior distribution learned through a regression-based auxiliary model to improve the efficiency of FM-based image generation. By initializing the ODE solver with a prior closer to the target data distribution, LeDiFlow allows for the learning of computationally tractable probability paths, reducing the number of solver steps needed for generating high-quality images. Empirical results show that LeDiFlow outperforms FM baselines, accelerating inference by up to 3.75x and enhancing image quality by 1.32x in CMMD metric. The method employs a State-of-the-Art transformer architecture and latent space sampling, making it feasible for training on consumer workstations. Overall, LeDiFlow presents a promising strategy for enhancing the efficiency and quality of image generation using FM. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.20723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the efficiency of high-quality image generation using Diffusion Models (DMs) is a significant challenge due to the iterative nature of the process. Flow Matching (FM) is emerging as a powerful generative modeling paradigm based on a simulation-free training objective instead of a score-based one used in DMs. Typical FM approaches rely on a Gaussian distribution prior, which induces curved, conditional probability paths between the prior and target data distribution. These curved paths pose a challenge for the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver, requiring a large number of inference calls to the flow prediction network. To address this issue, we present Learned Distribution-guided Flow Matching (LeDiFlow), a novel scalable method for training FM-based image generation models using a better-suited prior distribution learned via a regression-based auxiliary model. By initializing the ODE solver with a prior closer to the target data distribution, LeDiFlow enables the learning of more computationally tractable probability paths. These paths directly translate to fewer solver steps needed for high-quality image generation at inference time. Our method utilizes a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) transformer architecture combined with latent space sampling and can be trained on a consumer workstation. We empirically demonstrate that LeDiFlow remarkably outperforms the respective FM baselines. For instance, when operating directly on pixels, our model accelerates inference by up to 3.75x compared to the corresponding pixel-space baseline. Simultaneously, our latent FM model enhances image quality on average by 1.32x in CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) metric against its respective baseline.

Summary:  
Intern-GS is a new approach for sparse-view scene reconstruction that utilizes vision foundation models to enhance the process of Gaussian splatting. It addresses the limitations of sparse inputs by using DUSt3R for initialization to generate a dense and non-redundant Gaussian point cloud. This method improves over traditional structure-from-motion methods by alleviating struggles under sparse-view constraints. During optimization, vision foundation models predict depth and appearance for unobserved views, refining the 3D Gaussians to compensate for missing information in unseen regions. Experimental results show that Intern-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across various datasets, including forward-facing and large-scale scenes like LLFF, DTU, and Tanks and Temples.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse-view scene reconstruction often faces significant challenges due to the constraints imposed by limited observational data. These limitations result in incomplete information, leading to suboptimal reconstructions using existing methodologies. To address this, we present Intern-GS, a novel approach that effectively leverages rich prior knowledge from vision foundation models to enhance the process of sparse-view Gaussian Splatting, thereby enabling high-quality scene reconstruction. Specifically, Intern-GS utilizes vision foundation models to guide both the initialization and the optimization process of 3D Gaussian splatting, effectively addressing the limitations of sparse inputs. In the initialization process, our method employs DUSt3R to generate a dense and non-redundant gaussian point cloud. This approach significantly alleviates the limitations encountered by traditional structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, which often struggle under sparse-view constraints. During the optimization process, vision foundation models predict depth and appearance for unobserved views, refining the 3D Gaussians to compensate for missing information in unseen regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Intern-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across diverse datasets, including both forward-facing and large-scale scenes, such as LLFF, DTU, and Tanks and Temples.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework, MoPFormer, for enhancing Human Activity Recognition (HAR) interpretability and cross-dataset generalization using wearable sensors. MoPFormer tokenizes sensor signals into motion primitives and employs a Transformer architecture to learn temporal representations. It consists of two stages: segmentation and quantization in the first stage, and embedding and transformation in the second stage. Pre-training with a masked motion-modeling objective helps MoPFormer develop robust representations across varied sensor setups. Experimental results on six HAR benchmarks showcase MoPFormer's superior performance and generalizability compared to existing methods. The learned motion primitives improve interpretability and cross-dataset performance by capturing consistent movement patterns across similar activities, irrespective of dataset differences.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is challenged by limited interpretability, which significantly impacts cross-dataset generalization. To address this challenge, we propose Motion-Primitive Transformer (MoPFormer), a novel self-supervised framework that enhances interpretability by tokenizing inertial measurement unit signals into semantically meaningful motion primitives and leverages a Transformer architecture to learn rich temporal representations. MoPFormer comprises two-stages. first stage is to partition multi-channel sensor streams into short segments and quantizing them into discrete "motion primitive" codewords, while the second stage enriches those tokenized sequences through a context-aware embedding module and then processes them with a Transformer encoder. The proposed MoPFormer can be pre-trained using a masked motion-modeling objective that reconstructs missing primitives, enabling it to develop robust representations across diverse sensor configurations. Experiments on six HAR benchmarks demonstrate that MoPFormer not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also successfully generalizes across multiple datasets. Most importantly, the learned motion primitives significantly enhance both interpretability and cross-dataset performance by capturing fundamental movement patterns that remain consistent across similar activities regardless of dataset origin.

<div> Keywords: Large Multimodal Models, compositional reasoning, visual understanding, visual reasoning mechanism, Griffon-R

Summary: 
Griffon-R is a new unified visual reasoning mechanism designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). This mechanism enables LMMs to solve complex compositional problems by leveraging their intrinsic visual understanding capabilities in an end-to-end process. Unlike previous methods, Griffon-R follows a human-like understanding-thinking-answering process, eliminating the need for multiple inferences or external tools. The model is trained on a dataset of 334K visual instruction samples covering various scenes and foundational visual capabilities. Griffon-R showcases advanced performance on benchmarks for complex visual reasoning, such as VSR and CLEVR, as well as across various multimodal benchmarks like MMBench and ScienceQA. The approach bridges the gap between foundational visual capabilities and general question answering, encouraging LMMs to generate accurate and traceable responses for challenging visual reasoning tasks. The data, models, and codes for Griffon-R will be available on GitHub. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable visual understanding performance on both vision-language and vision-centric tasks. However, they often fall short in integrating advanced, task-specific capabilities for compositional reasoning, which hinders their progress toward truly competent general vision models. To address this, we present a unified visual reasoning mechanism that enables LMMs to solve complicated compositional problems by leveraging their intrinsic capabilities (e.g. grounding and visual understanding capabilities). Different from the previous shortcut learning mechanism, our approach introduces a human-like understanding-thinking-answering process, allowing the model to complete all steps in a single pass forwarding without the need for multiple inferences or external tools. This design bridges the gap between foundational visual capabilities and general question answering, encouraging LMMs to generate faithful and traceable responses for complex visual reasoning. Meanwhile, we curate 334K visual instruction samples covering both general scenes and text-rich scenes and involving multiple foundational visual capabilities. Our trained model, Griffon-R, has the ability of end-to-end automatic understanding, self-thinking, and reasoning answers. Comprehensive experiments show that Griffon-R not only achieves advancing performance on complex visual reasoning benchmarks including VSR and CLEVR, but also enhances multimodal capabilities across various benchmarks like MMBench and ScienceQA. Data, models, and codes will be release at https://github.com/jefferyZhan/Griffon/tree/master/Griffon-R soon.

<div> benchmark, part grounding, segmenting LMMs, PLUM, fine-grained visual understanding

Summary:
PARTONOMY is introduced as a benchmark for pixel-level part grounding in large multimodal models (LMMs). It challenges models to identify specialized concepts, compare object parts, consider part-whole relationships, and justify textual predictions with visual segmentations. Existing segmentation-enabled LMMs face limitations in part grounding abilities due to architectural shortcomings. PLUM, a novel segmenting LMM, addresses these deficiencies by using span tagging instead of segmentation tokens and conditioning on prior predictions in a feedback loop. Pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on various benchmarks, including reasoning segmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination. Finetuned PLUM on the Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive with segmenting LMMs trained on more data, highlighting its effectiveness in enabling fine-grained, grounded visual understanding in LMMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world objects are composed of distinctive, object-specific parts. Identifying these parts is key to performing fine-grained, compositional reasoning-yet, large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to perform this seemingly straightforward task. In this work, we introduce PARTONOMY, an LMM benchmark designed for pixel-level part grounding. We construct PARTONOMY from existing part datasets and our own rigorously annotated set of images, encompassing 862 part labels and 534 object labels for evaluation. Unlike existing datasets that simply ask models to identify generic parts, PARTONOMY uses specialized concepts (e.g., agricultural airplane), and challenges models to compare objects' parts, consider part-whole relationships, and justify textual predictions with visual segmentations. Our experiments demonstrate significant limitations in state-of-the-art LMMs (e.g., LISA-13B achieves only 5.9% gIoU), highlighting a critical gap in their part grounding abilities. We note that existing segmentation-enabled LMMs (segmenting LMMs) have two key architectural shortcomings: they use special [SEG] tokens not seen during pretraining which induce distribution shift, and they discard predicted segmentations instead of using past predictions to guide future ones. To address these deficiencies, we train several part-centric LMMs and propose PLUM, a novel segmenting LMM that uses span tagging instead of segmentation tokens and that conditions on prior predictions in a feedback loop. We find that pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on reasoning segmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination benchmarks. In addition, PLUM finetuned on our proposed Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive with segmenting LMMs trained on significantly more segmentation data. Our work opens up new avenues towards enabling fine-grained, grounded visual understanding in LMMs.

Summary:
Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a challenging task that involves retrieving a target image based on a query image and a text description. Existing CIR methods often struggle to accurately represent the image and text modifications, leading to subpar performance. To address this limitation, a new CIR framework called ConText-CIR has been introduced. This framework is trained with a Text Concept-Consistency loss that improves the representation of noun phrases in the text modification, allowing them to better align with relevant parts of the query image. Additionally, a synthetic data generation pipeline has been proposed to create training data from existing CIR datasets or unlabeled images. These components combined have led to improved performance on CIR tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art in composed image retrieval in both supervised and zero-shot settings on various benchmark datasets such as CIRR and CIRCO. The source code, model checkpoints, and new datasets are freely available on GitHub. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image specified by a query image and a relative text that describes a semantic modification to the query image. Existing methods in CIR struggle to accurately represent the image and the text modification, resulting in subpar performance. To address this limitation, we introduce a CIR framework, ConText-CIR, trained with a Text Concept-Consistency loss that encourages the representations of noun phrases in the text modification to better attend to the relevant parts of the query image. To support training with this loss function, we also propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that creates training data from existing CIR datasets or unlabeled images. We show that these components together enable stronger performance on CIR tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art in composed image retrieval in both the supervised and zero-shot settings on multiple benchmark datasets, including CIRR and CIRCO.

Summary:
MetaSlot is introduced as a flexible Slot Attention variant for learning object-level, structured representations in vision tasks. It adapts to variable object counts by maintaining a codebook of prototypes, removing duplicates, and injecting noise for stabilization. MetaSlot can be seamlessly integrated into existing Object-Centric Learning architectures. Models with MetaSlot outperform existing Slot Attention variants across various datasets and tasks, showing significant performance gains and producing interpretable slot representations. The key features of MetaSlot include vector-quantizing slot representations to create a codebook, eliminating duplicates, and introducing progressive noise for faster and more stable aggregation. <div>
arXiv:2505.20772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning object-level, structured representations is widely regarded as a key to better generalization in vision and underpins the design of next-generation Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs). Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL) methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects' super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However, their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts. MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared with existing Slot Attention variants.

Abstract: DeepSeek R1 has significantly advanced complex reasoning for large language models (LLMs). While recent methods have attempted to replicate R1's reasoning capabilities in multimodal settings, they face limitations, including inconsistencies between reasoning and final answers, model instability and crashes during long-chain exploration, and low data learning efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose TACO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for visual reasoning. Building on Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO), TACO introduces Think-Answer Consistency, which tightly couples reasoning with answer consistency to ensure answers are grounded in thoughtful reasoning. We also introduce the Rollback Resample Strategy, which adaptively removes problematic samples and reintroduces them to the sampler, enabling stable long-chain exploration and future learning opportunities. Additionally, TACO employs an adaptive learning schedule that focuses on moderate difficulty samples to optimize data efficiency. Furthermore, we propose the Test-Time-Resolution-Scaling scheme to address performance degradation due to varying resolutions during reasoning while balancing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks for REC and VQA tasks show that fine-tuning LVLMs leads to significant performance improvements.

<br />
Summary: 
Cross-Domain Multi-Targeted Attack (CD-MTA) is introduced as a method for generating adversarial examples that mislead image classifiers towards any target class, including those not seen during training. Traditional targeted attacks are limited to one class per model, necessitating retraining for each target. CD-MTA addresses this limitation by introducing a perturbation generator with a conditional input to specify the target class. Unlike existing methods, CD-MTA does not rely on class embeddings and instead utilizes image-based conditional inputs, removing the dependence on class semantics. This design enables generalization to unseen classes across datasets without accessing the black-box model's training data. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that CD-MTA outperforms previous multi-targeted attacks in both standard and cross-domain settings. <div>

Abstract: We present Cross-Domain Multi-Targeted Attack (CD-MTA), a method for generating adversarial examples that mislead image classifiers toward any target class, including those not seen during training. Traditional targeted attacks are limited to one class per model, requiring expensive retraining for each target. Multi-targeted attacks address this by introducing a perturbation generator with a conditional input to specify the target class. However, existing methods are constrained to classes observed during training and require access to the black-box model's training data--introducing a form of data leakage that undermines realistic evaluation in practical black-box scenarios. We identify overreliance on class embeddings as a key limitation, leading to overfitting and poor generalization to unseen classes. To address this, CD-MTA replaces class-level supervision with an image-based conditional input and introduces class-agnostic losses that align the perturbed and target images in the feature space. This design removes dependence on class semantics, thereby enabling generalization to unseen classes across datasets. Experiments on ImageNet and seven other datasets show that CD-MTA outperforms prior multi-targeted attacks in both standard and cross-domain settings--without accessing the black-box model's training data.

Abstract: Inverse problems (IPs) involve reconstructing signals from noisy observations. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted priors, which can fail to capture the complexity of real-world data. The advent of pre-trained generative models has introduced new paradigms, offering improved reconstructions by learning rich priors from data. Among these, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework, achieving remarkable reconstruction performance across numerous IPs. However, existing DM-based methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work DMPlug~\cite{wang2024dmplug}, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our approach under appropriate conditions and validate its superiority through extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) offer a powerful format for representing visual designs as interpretable code. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled high-quality SVG generation by framing the problem as a code generation task and leveraging large-scale pretraining. VLMs are particularly suitable for this task as they capture both global semantics and fine-grained visual patterns, while transferring knowledge across vision, natural language, and code domains. However, existing VLM approaches often struggle to produce faithful and efficient SVGs because they never observe the rendered images during training. Although differentiable rendering for autoregressive SVG code generation remains unavailable, rendered outputs can still be compared to original inputs, enabling evaluative feedback suitable for reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce RLRF(Reinforcement Learning from Rendering Feedback), an RL method that enhances SVG generation in autoregressive VLMs by leveraging feedback from rendered SVG outputs. Given an input image, the model generates SVG roll-outs that are rendered and compared to the original image to compute a reward. This visual fidelity feedback guides the model toward producing more accurate, efficient, and semantically coherent SVGs. RLRF significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning, addressing common failure modes and enabling precise, high-quality SVG generation with strong structural understanding and generalization.

<title>Not All Thats Rare Is Lost: Causal Paths to Rare Concept Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in high-fidelity image generation but often falter when synthesizing rare concepts, i.e., prompts that are infrequently observed in the training distribution. In this paper, we introduce RAP, a principled framework that treats rare concept generation as navigating a latent causal path: a progressive, model-aligned trajectory through the generative space from frequent concepts to rare targets. Rather than relying on heuristic prompt alternation, we theoretically justify that rare prompt guidance can be approximated by semantically related frequent prompts. We then formulate prompt switching as a dynamic process based on score similarity, enabling adaptive stage transitions. Furthermore, we reinterpret prompt alternation as a second-order denoising mechanism, promoting smooth semantic progression and coherent visual synthesis. Through this causal lens, we align input scheduling with the model's internal generative dynamics. Experiments across diverse diffusion backbones demonstrate that RAP consistently enhances rare concept generation, outperforming strong baselines in both automated evaluations and human studies.

<title>Frame-Level Captions for Long Video Generation with Complex Multi Scenes</title>

Abstract: Generating long videos that can show complex stories, like movie scenes from scripts, has great promise and offers much more than short clips. However, current methods that use autoregression with diffusion models often struggle because their step-by-step process naturally leads to a serious error accumulation (drift). Also, many existing ways to make long videos focus on single, continuous scenes, making them less useful for stories with many events and changes. This paper introduces a new approach to solve these problems. First, we propose a novel way to annotate datasets at the frame-level, providing detailed text guidance needed for making complex, multi-scene long videos. This detailed guidance works with a Frame-Level Attention Mechanism to make sure text and video match precisely. A key feature is that each part (frame) within these windows can be guided by its own distinct text prompt. Our training uses Diffusion Forcing to provide the model with the ability to handle time flexibly. We tested our approach on difficult VBench 2.0 benchmarks ("Complex Plots" and "Complex Landscapes") based on the WanX2.1-T2V-1.3B model. The results show our method is better at following instructions in complex, changing scenes and creates high-quality long videos. We plan to share our dataset annotation methods and trained models with the research community. Project page: https://zgctroy.github.io/frame-level-captions .

<title>Causality-Driven Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>

Abstract: Image fusion aims to combine complementary information from multiple source images to generate more comprehensive scene representations. Existing methods primarily rely on the stacking and design of network architectures to enhance the fusion performance, often ignoring the impact of dataset scene bias on model training. This oversight leads the model to learn spurious correlations between specific scenes and fusion weights under conventional likelihood estimation framework, thereby limiting fusion performance. To solve the above problems, this paper first re-examines the image fusion task from the causality perspective, and disentangles the model from the impact of bias by constructing a tailored causal graph to clarify the causalities among the variables in image fusion task. Then, the Back-door Adjustment based Feature Fusion Module (BAFFM) is proposed to eliminate confounder interference and enable the model to learn the true causal effect. Finally, Extensive experiments on three standard datasets prove that the proposed method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in infrared and visible image fusion.

<title>Fully Spiking Neural Networks for Unified Frame-Event Object Tracking</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of image and event streams offers a promising approach for achieving robust visual object tracking in complex environments. However, current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse, asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption, attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. The code will be released.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Bundle Adjustment (BA) methods require accurate initial estimates for convergence and typically assume known camera intrinsics, which limits their applicability when such information is uncertain or unavailable. We propose a novel probabilistic formulation of BA (ProBA) that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty in both the 2D observations and the 3D scene structure, enabling optimization without any prior knowledge of camera poses or focal length. Our method uses 3D Gaussians instead of point-like landmarks and we introduce uncertainty-aware reprojection losses by projecting the 3D Gaussians onto the 2D image space, and enforce geometric consistency across multiple 3D Gaussians using the Bhattacharyya coefficient to encourage overlap between their corresponding Gaussian distributions. This probabilistic framework leads to more robust and reliable optimization, even in the presence of outliers in the correspondence set, reducing the likelihood of converging to poor local minima. Experimental results show that \textit{ProBA} outperforms traditional methods in challenging real-world conditions. By removing the need for strong initialization and known intrinsics, ProBA enhances the practicality of SLAM systems deployed in unstructured environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: This paper introduces a new control signal for facial motion generation: timeline control. Compared to audio and text signals, timelines provide more fine-grained control, such as generating specific facial motions with precise timing. Users can specify a multi-track timeline of facial actions arranged in temporal intervals, allowing precise control over the timing of each action. To model the timeline control capability, We first annotate the time intervals of facial actions in natural facial motion sequences at a frame-level granularity. This process is facilitated by Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-based Clustering to minimize human labor. Based on the annotations, we propose a diffusion-based generation model capable of generating facial motions that are natural and accurately aligned with input timelines. Our method supports text-guided motion generation by using ChatGPT to convert text into timelines. Experimental results show that our method can annotate facial action intervals with satisfactory accuracy, and produces natural facial motions accurately aligned with timelines.

<title>AVCD: Mitigating Hallucinations in Audio-Visual Large Language Models through Contrastive Decoding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20862</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination remains a major challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this, various contrastive decoding (CD) methods have been proposed that contrasts original logits with hallucinated logits generated from perturbed inputs. While CD has shown promise in vision-language models (VLMs), it is not well-suited for AV-LLMs, where hallucinations often emerge from both unimodal and cross-modal combinations involving audio, video, and language. These intricate interactions call for a more adaptive and modality-aware decoding strategy. In this paper, we propose Audio-Visual Contrastive Decoding (AVCD)-a novel, training-free decoding framework designed to model trimodal interactions and suppress modality-induced hallucinations in AV-LLMs. Unlike previous CD methods in VLMs that corrupt a fixed modality, AVCD leverages attention distributions to dynamically identify less dominant modalities and applies attentive masking to generate perturbed output logits. To support CD in a trimodal setting, we also reformulate the original CD framework to jointly handle audio, visual, and textual inputs. Finally, to improve efficiency, we introduce entropy-guided adaptive decoding, which selectively skips unnecessary decoding steps based on the model's confidence in its predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AVCD consistently outperforms existing decoding methods. Especially, on the AVHBench dataset, it improves accuracy by 6% for VideoLLaMA2 and 11% for video-SALMONN, demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Large transformer models have been shown to be capable of performing in-context learning. By using examples in a prompt as well as a query, they are capable of performing tasks such as few-shot, one-shot, or zero-shot learning to output the corresponding answer to this query. One area of interest to us is that these transformer models have been shown to be capable of learning the general class of certain functions, such as linear functions and small 2-layer neural networks, on random data (Garg et al, 2023). We aim to extend this to the image space to analyze their capability to in-context learn more complex functions on the image space, such as convolutional neural networks and other methods.

<title>Fork-Merge Decoding: Enhancing Multimodal Understanding in Audio-Visual Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to enhance balanced multimodal understanding in audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs) by addressing modality bias without requiring additional training. In current AV-LLMs, audio and video features are typically processed jointly in the decoder. While this strategy facilitates unified multimodal understanding, it may introduce modality bias, where the model tends to over-rely on one modality due to imbalanced training signals. To mitigate this, we propose Fork-Merge Decoding (FMD), a simple yet effective inference-time strategy that requires no additional training or architectural modifications. FMD first performs modality-specific reasoning by processing audio-only and video-only inputs through the early decoder layers (a fork phase), and then merges the resulting hidden states for joint reasoning in the remaining layers (a merge phase). This approach promotes balanced modality contributions and leverages complementary information across modalities. We evaluate our method on two representative AV-LLMs, VideoLLaMA2 and video-SALMONN, using three benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements on tasks focused on audio, video, and combined audio-visual reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of inference-time interventions for robust multimodal understanding.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a stereo radargrammetry method using deep learning from airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.Deep learning-based methods are considered to suffer less from geometric image modulation, while there is no public SAR image dataset used to train such methods.We create a SAR image dataset and perform fine-tuning of a deep learning-based image correspondence method.The proposed method suppresses the degradation of image quality by pixel interpolation without ground projection of the SAR image and divides the SAR image into patches for processing, which makes it possible to apply deep learning.Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits a wider range and more accurate elevation measurements compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Fire detection in dynamic environments faces continuous challenges, including the interference of illumination changes, many false detections or missed detections, and it is difficult to achieve both efficiency and accuracy. To address the problem of feature extraction limitation and information loss in the existing YOLO-based models, this study propose You Only Look Once for Fire Detection with Attention-guided Inverted Residual and Dual-pooling Downscale Fusion (YOLO-FireAD) with two core innovations: (1) Attention-guided Inverted Residual Block (AIR) integrates hybrid channel-spatial attention with inverted residuals to adaptively enhance fire features and suppress environmental noise; (2) Dual Pool Downscale Fusion Block (DPDF) preserves multi-scale fire patterns through learnable fusion of max-average pooling outputs, mitigating small-fire detection failures. Extensive evaluation on two public datasets shows the efficient performance of our model. Our proposed model keeps the sum amount of parameters (1.45M, 51.8% lower than YOLOv8n) (4.6G, 43.2% lower than YOLOv8n), and mAP75 is higher than the mainstream real-time object detection models YOLOv8n, YOL-Ov9t, YOLOv10n, YOLO11n, YOLOv12n and other YOLOv8 variants 1.3-5.5%.

<title>Frequency Composition for Compressed and Domain-Adaptive Neural Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern on-device neural network applications must operate under resource constraints while adapting to unpredictable domain shifts. However, this combined challenge-model compression and domain adaptation-remains largely unaddressed, as prior work has tackled each issue in isolation: compressed networks prioritize efficiency within a fixed domain, whereas large, capable models focus on handling domain shifts. In this work, we propose CoDA, a frequency composition-based framework that unifies compression and domain adaptation. During training, CoDA employs quantization-aware training (QAT) with low-frequency components, enabling a compressed model to selectively learn robust, generalizable features. At test time, it refines the compact model in a source-free manner (i.e., test-time adaptation, TTA), leveraging the full-frequency information from incoming data to adapt to target domains while treating high-frequency components as domain-specific cues. LFC are aligned with the trained distribution, while HFC unique to the target distribution are solely utilized for batch normalization. CoDA can be integrated synergistically into existing QAT and TTA methods. CoDA is evaluated on widely used domain-shift benchmarks, including CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-C, across various model architectures. With significant compression, it achieves accuracy improvements of 7.96%p on CIFAR10-C and 5.37%p on ImageNet-C over the full-precision TTA baseline.

arXiv:2505.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to navigate by following natural instructions under partial observability, making it difficult to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is \href{https://github.com/zhangpingrui/Adaptive-Text-Dreamer}{here}.

Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects pose significant challenges for depth sensors, resulting in incomplete depth information that adversely affects downstream robotic perception and manipulation tasks. To address this issue, we propose HTMNet, a novel hybrid model integrating Transformer, CNN, and Mamba architectures. The encoder is constructed based on a dual-branch Transformer-CNN framework, while the multi-scale fusion module leverages a Transformer-Mamba architecture, which also serves as the foundation for the decoder design. We introduce a novel multimodal fusion module grounded in self-attention mechanisms and state space models, marking the first application of the Mamba architecture in the field of transparent object depth completion and revealing its promising potential. Additionally, we design an innovative multi-scale fusion module for the decoder that combines channel attention, spatial attention, and multi-scale feature extraction techniques to effectively integrate multi-scale features through a down-fusion strategy. Extensive evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced text-to-image generation, laying the foundation for the development of personalized generative frameworks. However, existing methods lack precise layout controllability and overlook the potential of dynamic features of reference subjects in improving fidelity. In this work, we propose Layout-Controllable Personalized Diffusion (LCP-Diffusion) model, a novel framework that integrates subject identity preservation with flexible layout guidance in a tuning-free approach. Our model employs a Dynamic-Static Complementary Visual Refining module to comprehensively capture the intricate details of reference subjects, and introduces a Dual Layout Control mechanism to enforce robust spatial control across both training and inference stages. Extensive experiments validate that LCP-Diffusion excels in both identity preservation and layout controllability. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneering work enabling users to "create anything anywhere".

Abstract: General object composition (GOC) aims to seamlessly integrate a target object into a background scene with desired geometric properties, while simultaneously preserving its fine-grained appearance details. Recent approaches derive semantic embeddings and integrate them into advanced diffusion models to enable geometry-editable generation. However, these highly compact embeddings encode only high-level semantic cues and inevitably discard fine-grained appearance details. We introduce a Disentangled Geometry-editable and Appearance-preserving Diffusion (DGAD) model that first leverages semantic embeddings to implicitly capture the desired geometric transformations and then employs a cross-attention retrieval mechanism to align fine-grained appearance features with the geometry-edited representation, facilitating both precise geometry editing and faithful appearance preservation in object composition. Specifically, DGAD builds on CLIP/DINO-derived and reference networks to extract semantic embeddings and appearance-preserving representations, which are then seamlessly integrated into the encoding and decoding pipelines in a disentangled manner. We first integrate the semantic embeddings into pre-trained diffusion models that exhibit strong spatial reasoning capabilities to implicitly capture object geometry, thereby facilitating flexible object manipulation and ensuring effective editability. Then, we design a dense cross-attention mechanism that leverages the implicitly learned object geometry to retrieve and spatially align appearance features with their corresponding regions, ensuring faithful appearance consistency. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DGAD framework.

Abstract: We present HuMoCon, a novel motion-video understanding framework designed for advanced human behavior analysis. The core of our method is a human motion concept discovery framework that efficiently trains multi-modal encoders to extract semantically meaningful and generalizable features. HuMoCon addresses key challenges in motion concept discovery for understanding and reasoning, including the lack of explicit multi-modality feature alignment and the loss of high-frequency information in masked autoencoding frameworks. Our approach integrates a feature alignment strategy that leverages video for contextual understanding and motion for fine-grained interaction modeling, further with a velocity reconstruction mechanism to enhance high-frequency feature expression and mitigate temporal over-smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that HuMoCon enables effective motion concept discovery and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in training large models for human motion understanding. We will open-source the associated code with our paper.

Abstract: Improving label quality in medical image segmentation is costly, but its benefits remain unclear. We systematically evaluate its impact using multiple pseudo-labeled versions of CT datasets, generated by models like nnU-Net, TotalSegmentator, and MedSAM. Our results show that while higher-quality labels improve in-domain performance, gains remain unclear if below a small threshold. For pre-training, label quality has minimal impact, suggesting that models rather transfer general concepts than detailed annotations. These findings provide guidance on when improving label quality is worth the effort.

Abstract: Network quantization is arguably one of the most practical network compression approaches for reducing the enormous resource consumption of modern deep neural networks. They usually require diverse and subtle design choices for specific architecture and tasks. Instead, the QwT method is a simple and general approach which introduces lightweight additional structures to improve quantization. But QwT incurs extra parameters and latency. More importantly, QwT is not compatible with many hardware platforms. In this paper, we propose QwT-v2, which not only enjoys all advantages of but also resolves major defects of QwT. By adopting a very lightweight channel-wise affine compensation (CWAC) module, QwT-v2 introduces significantly less extra parameters and computations compared to QwT, and at the same time matches or even outperforms QwT in accuracy. The compensation module of QwT-v2 can be integrated into quantization inference engines with little effort, which not only effectively removes the extra costs but also makes it compatible with most existing hardware platforms.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating single-instance scenes but struggle with multi-instance scenarios, often merging or omitting objects. Unlike previous training-free approaches that rely solely on semantic-level guidance without addressing instance individuation, our training-free method, Instance-to-Semantic Attention Control (ISAC), explicitly resolves incomplete instance formation and semantic entanglement through an instance-first modeling approach. This enables ISAC to effectively leverage a hierarchical, tree-structured prompt mechanism, disentangling multiple object instances and individually aligning them with their corresponding semantic labels. Without employing any external models, ISAC achieves up to 52% average multi-class accuracy and 83% average multi-instance accuracy by effectively forming disentangled instances. The code will be made available upon publication.

<title>PMA: Towards Parameter-Efficient Point Cloud Understanding via Point Mamba Adapter</title>

Abstract: Applying pre-trained models to assist point cloud understanding has recently become a mainstream paradigm in 3D perception. However, existing application strategies are straightforward, utilizing only the final output of the pre-trained model for various task heads. It neglects the rich complementary information in the intermediate layer, thereby failing to fully unlock the potential of pre-trained models. To overcome this limitation, we propose an orthogonal solution: Point Mamba Adapter (PMA), which constructs an ordered feature sequence from all layers of the pre-trained model and leverages Mamba to fuse all complementary semantics, thereby promoting comprehensive point cloud understanding. Constructing this ordered sequence is non-trivial due to the inherent isotropy of 3D space. Therefore, we further propose a geometry-constrained gate prompt generator (G2PG) shared across different layers, which applies shared geometric constraints to the output gates of the Mamba and dynamically optimizes the spatial order, thus enabling more effective integration of multi-layer information. Extensive experiments conducted on challenging point cloud datasets across various tasks demonstrate that our PMA elevates the capability for point cloud understanding to a new level by fusing diverse complementary intermediate features.

<title>DSOcc: Leveraging Depth Awareness and Semantic Aid to Boost Camera-Based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title>

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for perceiving surrounding scenes in autonomous driving. However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference, leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging Depth awareness and Semantic aid to boost camera-based 3D semantic Occupancy prediction (DSOcc). We jointly perform occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence is calculated through non-learning method and multiplied with image features to make the voxel representation aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit occupancy state inference. Rather than focusing on improving feature learning, we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among camera-based methods.

Abstract: Textual content in images is crucial in e-commerce sectors, particularly in marketing campaigns, product imaging, advertising, and the entertainment industry. Current text-to-image (T2I) generation diffusion models, though proficient at producing high-quality images, often struggle to incorporate text accurately onto complex surfaces with varied perspectives, such as angled views of architectural elements like buildings, banners, or walls. In this paper, we introduce the Surface Oriented Textual Image Generation (OrienText) method, which leverages region-specific surface normals as conditional input to T2I generation diffusion model. Our approach ensures accurate rendering and correct orientation of the text within the image context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the OrienText method on a self-curated dataset of images and compare it against the existing textual image generation methods.

Abstract: Neural fields (NFs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in scene reconstruction, powering various tasks such as novel view synthesis. However, existing NF methods relying on RGB or LiDAR inputs often exhibit severe fragility to adverse weather, particularly when applied in outdoor scenarios like autonomous driving. In contrast, millimeter-wave radar is inherently robust to environmental changes, while unfortunately, its integration with NFs remains largely underexplored. Besides, as outdoor driving scenarios frequently involve moving objects, making spatiotemporal modeling essential for temporally consistent novel view synthesis. To this end, we introduce RF4D, a radar-based neural field framework specifically designed for novel view synthesis in outdoor dynamic scenes. RF4D explicitly incorporates temporal information into its representation, significantly enhancing its capability to model moving objects. We further introduce a feature-level flow module that predicts latent temporal offsets between adjacent frames, enforcing temporal coherence in dynamic scene modeling. Moreover, we propose a radar-specific power rendering formulation closely aligned with radar sensing physics, improving synthesis accuracy and interoperability. Extensive experiments on public radar datasets demonstrate the superior performance of RF4D in terms of radar measurement synthesis quality and occupancy estimation accuracy, achieving especially pronounced improvements in dynamic outdoor scenarios.

Abstract: Personalized diffusion models have shown remarkable success in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation by enabling the injection of user-defined concepts into diverse contexts. However, balancing concept fidelity with contextual alignment remains a challenging open problem. In this work, we propose an RL-based approach that leverages the diverse outputs of T2I models to address this issue. Our method eliminates the need for human-annotated scores by generating a synthetic paired dataset for DPO-like training using external quality metrics. These better-worse pairs are specifically constructed to improve both concept fidelity and prompt adherence. Moreover, our approach supports flexible adjustment of the trade-off between image fidelity and textual alignment. Through multi-step training, our approach outperforms a naive baseline in convergence speed and output quality. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method across various architectures and fine-tuning techniques.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) collect and pseudo-label terabytes of multi-modal data localized to HD maps during normal fleet testing. However, identifying interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time and space. To address this problem, we introduce RefAV, a large-scale dataset of 10,000 diverse natural language queries that describe complex multi-agent interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object trackers and present an empirical analysis of our baselines. Notably, we find that naively repurposing off-the-shelf VLMs yields poor performance, suggesting that scenario mining presents unique challenges. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/CainanD/RefAV/ and https://argoverse.github.io/user-guide/tasks/scenario_mining.html

arXiv:2505.21002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of computer vision applications necessitates handling vast amounts of visual data, often containing personal information. While this technology offers significant benefits, it should not compromise privacy. Data privacy regulations emphasize the need for individual consent for processing personal data, hindering researchers' ability to collect high-quality datasets containing the faces of the individuals. This paper presents a deep learning-based face anonymization pipeline to overcome this challenge. Unlike most of the existing methods, our method leverages recent advancements in diffusion-based inpainting models, eliminating the need for training Generative Adversarial Networks. The pipeline employs a three-stage approach: face detection with RetinaNet, feature extraction with VGG-Face, and realistic face generation using the state-of-the-art BrushNet diffusion model. BrushNet utilizes the entire image, face masks, and text prompts specifying desired facial attributes like age, ethnicity, gender, and expression. This enables the generation of natural-looking images with unrecognizable individuals, facilitating the creation of privacy-compliant datasets for computer vision research.

<title>Unified Alignment Protocol: Making Sense of the Unlabeled Data in New Domains</title>

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) is gaining popularity over conventional Federated Learning in many real-world applications. Due to the practical limitation of limited labeled data on the client side, SSFL considers that participating clients train with unlabeled data, and only the central server has the necessary resources to access limited labeled data, making it an ideal fit for real-world applications (e.g., healthcare). However, traditional SSFL assumes that the data distributions in the training phase and testing phase are the same. In practice, however, domain shifts frequently occur, making it essential for SSFL to incorporate generalization capabilities and enhance their practicality. The core challenge is improving model generalization to new, unseen domains while the client participate in SSFL. However, the decentralized setup of SSFL and unsupervised client training necessitates innovation to achieve improved generalization across domains. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called the Unified Alignment Protocol (UAP), which consists of an alternating two-stage training process. The first stage involves training the server model to learn and align the features with a parametric distribution, which is subsequently communicated to clients without additional communication overhead. The second stage proposes a novel training algorithm that utilizes the server feature distribution to align client features accordingly. Our extensive experiments on standard domain generalization benchmark datasets across multiple model architectures reveal that proposed UAP successfully achieves SOTA generalization performance in SSFL setting.

Abstract: Internal representations are crucial for understanding deep neural networks, such as their properties and reasoning patterns, but remain difficult to interpret. While mapping from feature space to input space aids in interpreting the former, existing approaches often rely on crude approximations. We propose using a conditional diffusion model - a pretrained high-fidelity diffusion model conditioned on spatially resolved feature maps - to learn such a mapping in a probabilistic manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach across various pretrained image classifiers from CNNs to ViTs, showing excellent reconstruction capabilities. Through qualitative comparisons and robustness analysis, we validate our method and showcase possible applications, such as the visualization of concept steering in input space or investigations of the composite nature of the feature space. This approach has broad potential for improving feature space understanding in computer vision models.

Abstract: Video generation using diffusion models is highly computationally intensive, with 3D attention in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models accounting for over 80\% of the total computational resources. In this work, we introduce {\bf RainFusion}, a novel training-free sparse attention method that exploits inherent sparsity nature in visual data to accelerate attention computation while preserving video quality. Specifically, we identify three unique sparse patterns in video generation attention calculations--Spatial Pattern, Temporal Pattern and Textural Pattern. The sparse pattern for each attention head is determined online with negligible overhead (\textasciitilde\,0.2\%) with our proposed {\bf ARM} (Adaptive Recognition Module) during inference. Our proposed {\bf RainFusion} is a plug-and-play method, that can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art 3D-attention video generation models without additional training or calibration. We evaluate our method on leading open-sourced models including HunyuanVideo, OpenSoraPlan-1.2 and CogVideoX-5B, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that RainFusion achieves over {\bf 2\(\times\)} speedup in attention computation while maintaining video quality, with only a minimal impact on VBench scores (-0.2\%).

<title>Robust Video-Based Pothole Detection and Area Estimation for Intelligent Vehicles with Depth Map and Kalman Smoothing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21049</link>

Abstract: Road potholes pose a serious threat to driving safety and comfort, making their detection and assessment a critical task in fields such as autonomous driving. When driving vehicles, the operators usually avoid large potholes and approach smaller ones at reduced speeds to ensure safety. Therefore, accurately estimating pothole area is of vital importance. Most existing vision-based methods rely on distance priors to construct geometric models. However, their performance is susceptible to variations in camera angles and typically relies on the assumption of a flat road surface, potentially leading to significant errors in complex real-world environments. To address these problems, a robust pothole area estimation framework that integrates object detection and monocular depth estimation in a video stream is proposed in this paper. First, to enhance pothole feature extraction and improve the detection of small potholes, ACSH-YOLOv8 is proposed with ACmix module and the small object detection head. Then, the BoT-SORT algorithm is utilized for pothole tracking, while DepthAnything V2 generates depth maps for each frame. With the obtained depth maps and potholes labels, a novel Minimum Bounding Triangulated Pixel (MBTP) method is proposed for pothole area estimation. Finally, Kalman Filter based on Confidence and Distance (CDKF) is developed to maintain consistency of estimation results across consecutive frames. The results show that ACSH-YOLOv8 model achieves an AP(50) of 76.6%, representing a 7.6% improvement over YOLOv8. Through CDKF optimization across consecutive frames, pothole predictions become more robust, thereby enhancing the method's practical applicability.

Abstract: Despite the availability of large-scale 3D datasets and advancements in 3D generative models, the complexity and uneven quality of 3D geometry and texture data continue to hinder the performance of 3D generation techniques. In most existing approaches, 3D geometry and texture are generated in separate stages using different models and non-unified representations, frequently leading to unsatisfactory coherence between geometry and texture. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for joint generation of 3D geometry and texture. Specifically, we focus in generate a versatile 2.5D representations that can be seamlessly transformed between 2D and 3D. Our approach begins by integrating multiview RGB, normal, and coordinate images into a unified representation, termed as 2.5D latents. Next, we adapt pre-trained 2D foundation models for high-fidelity 2.5D generation, utilizing both text and image conditions. Finally, we introduce a lightweight 2.5D-to-3D refiner-decoder framework that efficiently generates detailed 3D representations from 2.5D images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only excels in generating high-quality 3D objects with coherent structure and color from text and image inputs but also significantly outperforms existing methods in geometry-conditioned texture generation.

Abstract: Stylizing 3D scenes instantly while maintaining multi-view consistency and faithfully resembling a style image remains a significant challenge. Current state-of-the-art 3D stylization methods typically involve computationally intensive test-time optimization to transfer artistic features into a pretrained 3D representation, often requiring dense posed input images. In contrast, leveraging recent advances in feed-forward reconstruction models, we demonstrate a novel approach to achieve direct 3D stylization in less than a second using unposed sparse-view scene images and an arbitrary style image. To address the inherent decoupling between reconstruction and stylization, we introduce a branched architecture that separates structure modeling and appearance shading, effectively preventing stylistic transfer from distorting the underlying 3D scene structure. Furthermore, we adapt an identity loss to facilitate pre-training our stylization model through the novel view synthesis task. This strategy also allows our model to retain its original reconstruction capabilities while being fine-tuned for stylization. Comprehensive evaluations, using both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality stylized 3D content that achieve a superior blend of style and scene appearance, while also outperforming existing methods in terms of multi-view consistency and efficiency.

Abstract: Aligning large VLMs with human preferences is a challenging task, as methods like RLHF and DPO often overfit to textual information or exacerbate hallucinations. Although augmenting negative image samples partially addresses these pitfalls, no prior work has employed listwise preference optimization for VLMs, due to the complexity and cost of constructing listwise image samples. In this work, we propose LPOI, the first object-aware listwise preference optimization developed for reducing hallucinations in VLMs. LPOI identifies and masks a critical object in the image, and then interpolates the masked region between the positive and negative images to form a sequence of incrementally more complete images. The model is trained to rank these images in ascending order of object visibility, effectively reducing hallucinations while retaining visual fidelity. LPOI requires no extra annotations beyond standard pairwise preference data, as it automatically constructs the ranked lists through object masking and interpolation. Comprehensive experiments on MMHalBench, AMBER, and Object HalBench confirm that LPOI outperforms existing preference optimization methods in reducing hallucinations and enhancing VLM performance. We make the code available at https://github.com/fatemehpesaran310/lpoi.

Abstract: While virtual try-on (VTON) systems aim to render a garment onto a target person image, this paper tackles the novel task of virtual try-off (VTOFF), which addresses the inverse problem: generating standardized product images of garments from real-world photos of clothed individuals. Unlike VTON, which must resolve diverse pose and style variations, VTOFF benefits from a consistent and well-defined output format -- typically a flat, lay-down-style representation of the garment -- making it a promising tool for data generation and dataset enhancement. However, existing VTOFF approaches face two major limitations: (i) difficulty in disentangling garment features from occlusions and complex poses, often leading to visual artifacts, and (ii) restricted applicability to single-category garments (e.g., upper-body clothes only), limiting generalization. To address these challenges, we present Text-Enhanced MUlti-category Virtual Try-Off (TEMU-VTOFF), a novel architecture featuring a dual DiT-based backbone with a modified multimodal attention mechanism for robust garment feature extraction. Our architecture is designed to receive garment information from multiple modalities like images, text, and masks to work in a multi-category setting. Finally, we propose an additional alignment module to further refine the generated visual details. Experiments on VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets show that TEMU-VTOFF sets a new state-of-the-art on the VTOFF task, significantly improving both visual quality and fidelity to the target garments.

arXiv:2505.21070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based video diffusion models generate high-quality videos at scale but incur prohibitive processing latency and memory costs for long videos. To address this, we propose a novel distributed inference strategy, termed DualParal. The core idea is that, instead of generating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames and model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division faces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise levels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of original parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle this. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with progressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and layer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling asynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we incorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on each GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context, minimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we employ a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally consistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs without extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and infinitely long video generation. Applied to the latest diffusion transformer video generator, our method efficiently produces 1,025-frame videos with up to 6.54$\times$ lower latency and 1.48$\times$ lower memory cost on 8$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual understanding, but their application to long-term Earth observation analysis remains limited, primarily focusing on single-temporal or bi-temporal imagery. To address this gap, we introduce DVL-Suite, a comprehensive framework for analyzing long-term urban dynamics through remote sensing imagery. Our suite comprises 15,063 high-resolution (1.0m) multi-temporal images spanning 42 megacities in the U.S. from 2005 to 2023, organized into two components: DVL-Bench and DVL-Instruct. The DVL-Bench includes seven urban understanding tasks, from fundamental change detection (pixel-level) to quantitative analyses (regional-level) and comprehensive urban narratives (scene-level), capturing diverse urban dynamics including expansion/transformation patterns, disaster assessment, and environmental challenges. We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art multimodal large language models and reveal their limitations in long-term temporal understanding and quantitative analysis. These challenges motivate the creation of DVL-Instruct, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset designed to enhance models' capabilities in multi-temporal Earth observation. Building upon this dataset, we develop DVLChat, a baseline model capable of both image-level question-answering and pixel-level segmentation, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of city dynamics through language interactions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential for comprehensive 3D scene understanding. However, existing approaches typically utilize only one or a limited subset of 3D modalities, resulting in incomplete representations of 3D scenes and reduced interpretive accuracy. Furthermore, different types of queries inherently depend on distinct modalities, indicating that uniform processing of all modality tokens may fail to effectively capture query-specific context. To address these challenges, we propose Uni3D-MoE, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based 3D MLLM designed to enable adaptive 3D multimodal fusion. Specifically, Uni3D-MoE integrates a comprehensive set of 3D modalities, including multi-view RGB and depth images, bird's-eye-view (BEV) maps, point clouds, and voxel representations. At its core, our framework employs a learnable routing mechanism within the sparse MoE-based large language model, dynamically selecting appropriate experts at the token level. Each expert specializes in processing multimodal tokens based on learned modality preferences, thus facilitating flexible collaboration tailored to diverse task-specific requirements. Extensive evaluations on standard 3D scene understanding benchmarks and specialized datasets demonstrate the efficacy of Uni3D-MoE.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made great achievements in Earth vision. However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types, geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response. DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard: DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts, which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters. 2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios, DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks, harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap, and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization capabilities.

<title>Instance Data Condensation for Image Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: Deep learning based image Super-Resolution (ISR) relies on large training datasets to optimize model generalization; this requires substantial computational and storage resources during training. While dataset condensation has shown potential in improving data efficiency and privacy for high-level computer vision tasks, it has not yet been fully exploited for ISR. In this paper, we propose a novel Instance Data Condensation (IDC) framework specifically for ISR, which achieves instance-level data condensation through Random Local Fourier Feature Extraction and Multi-level Feature Distribution Matching. This aims to optimize feature distributions at both global and local levels and obtain high-quality synthesized training content with fine detail. This framework has been utilized to condense the most commonly used training dataset for ISR, DIV2K, with a 10% condensation rate. The resulting synthetic dataset offers comparable or (in certain cases) even better performance compared to the original full dataset and excellent training stability when used to train various popular ISR models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a condensed/synthetic dataset (with a 10% data volume) has demonstrated such performance. The source code and the synthetic dataset have been made available at https://github.com/.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation quality but at the cost of numerous function evaluations. Recently, advanced ODE-based solvers have been developed to mitigate the substantial computational demands of reverse-diffusion solving under limited sampling steps. However, these solvers, heavily inspired by Adams-like multistep methods, rely solely on t-related Lagrange interpolation. We show that t-related Lagrange interpolation is suboptimal for diffusion model and reveal a compact search space comprised of time steps and solver coefficients. Building on our analysis, we propose a novel differentiable solver search algorithm to identify more optimal solver. Equipped with the searched solver, rectified-flow models, e.g., SiT-XL/2 and FlowDCN-XL/2, achieve FID scores of 2.40 and 2.35, respectively, on ImageNet256 with only 10 steps. Meanwhile, DDPM model, DiT-XL/2, reaches a FID score of 2.33 with only 10 steps. Notably, our searched solver outperforms traditional solvers by a significant margin. Moreover, our searched solver demonstrates generality across various model architectures, resolutions, and model sizes.

Abstract: The task of reassembly is a significant challenge across multiple domains, including archaeology, genomics, and molecular docking, requiring the precise placement and orientation of elements to reconstruct an original structure. In this work, we address key limitations in state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods for reassembly, namely i) scalability; ii) multimodality; and iii) real-world applicability: beyond square or simple geometric shapes, realistic and complex erosion, or other real-world problems. We propose ReassembleNet, a method that reduces complexity by representing each input piece as a set of contour keypoints and learning to select the most informative ones by Graph Neural Networks pooling inspired techniques. ReassembleNet effectively lowers computational complexity while enabling the integration of features from multiple modalities, including both geometric and texture data. Further enhanced through pretraining on a semi-synthetic dataset. We then apply diffusion-based pose estimation to recover the original structure. We improve on prior methods by 55% and 86% for RMSE Rotation and Translation, respectively.

Abstract: In latest years plethora of identity-preserving adapters for a personalized generation with diffusion models have been released. Their main disadvantage is that they are dominantly trained jointly with base diffusion models, which suffer from slow multi-step inference. This work aims to tackle the challenge of training-free adaptation of pretrained ID-adapters to diffusion models accelerated via distillation - through careful re-design of classifier-free guidance for few-step stylistic generation and attention manipulation mechanisms in decoupled blocks to improve identity similarity and fidelity, we propose universal FastFace framework. Additionally, we develop a disentangled public evaluation protocol for id-preserving adapters.

Abstract: Robust unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) in real-world scenarios is an important task. Current methods exhibit severe performance degradation on the MVTec AD 2 benchmark due to its complex real-world challenges. To solve this problem, we propose a robust framework RoBiS, which consists of three core modules: (1) Swin-Cropping, a high-resolution image pre-processing strategy to preserve the information of small anomalies through overlapping window cropping. (2) The data augmentation of noise addition and lighting simulation is carried out on the training data to improve the robustness of AD model. We use INP-Former as our baseline, which could generate better results on the various sub-images. (3) The traditional statistical-based binarization strategy (mean+3std) is combined with our previous work, MEBin (published in CVPR2025), for joint adaptive binarization. Then, SAM is further employed to refine the segmentation results. Compared with some methods reported by the MVTec AD 2, our RoBiS achieves a 29.2% SegF1 improvement (from 21.8% to 51.00%) on Test_private and 29.82% SegF1 gains (from 16.7% to 46.52%) on Test_private_mixed.

<title>Normalized Attention Guidance: Universal Negative Guidance for Diffusion Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative guidance -- explicitly suppressing unwanted attributes -- remains a fundamental challenge in diffusion models, particularly in few-step sampling regimes. While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) works well in standard settings, it fails under aggressive sampling step compression due to divergent predictions between positive and negative branches. We present Normalized Attention Guidance (NAG), an efficient, training-free mechanism that applies extrapolation in attention space with L1-based normalization and refinement. NAG restores effective negative guidance where CFG collapses while maintaining fidelity. Unlike existing approaches, NAG generalizes across architectures (UNet, DiT), sampling regimes (few-step, multi-step), and modalities (image, video), functioning as a \textit{universal} plug-in with minimal computational overhead. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate consistent improvements in text alignment (CLIP Score), fidelity (FID, PFID), and human-perceived quality (ImageReward). Our ablation studies validate each design component, while user studies confirm significant preference for NAG-guided outputs. As a model-agnostic inference-time approach requiring no retraining, NAG provides effortless negative guidance for all modern diffusion frameworks -- pseudocode in the Appendix!

<title>Boosting Adversarial Transferability via High-Frequency Augmentation and Hierarchical-Gradient Fusion</title>

arXiv:2505.21181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks have become a significant challenge in the security of machine learning models, particularly in the context of black-box defense strategies. Existing methods for enhancing adversarial transferability primarily focus on the spatial domain. This paper presents Frequency-Space Attack (FSA), a new adversarial attack framework that effectively integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain transformations. FSA combines two key techniques: (1) High-Frequency Augmentation, which applies Fourier transform with frequency-selective amplification to diversify inputs and emphasize the critical role of high-frequency components in adversarial attacks, and (2) Hierarchical-Gradient Fusion, which merges multi-scale gradient decomposition and fusion to capture both global structures and fine-grained details, resulting in smoother perturbations. Our experiment demonstrates that FSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various black-box models. Notably, our proposed FSA achieves an average attack success rate increase of 23.6% compared with BSR (CVPR 2024) on eight black-box defense models.

Abstract: Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and power efficiency, making them well-suited for edge AI applications. However, their high event rates present challenges for data transmission and processing. Subsampling methods provide a practical solution, but their effect on downstream visual tasks remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate six hardware-friendly subsampling methods using convolutional neural networks for event video classification on various benchmark datasets. We hypothesize that events from high-density regions carry more task-relevant information and are therefore better suited for subsampling. To test this, we introduce a simple causal density-based subsampling method, demonstrating improved classification accuracy in sparse regimes. Our analysis further highlights key factors affecting subsampling performance, including sensitivity to hyperparameters and failure cases in scenarios with large event count variance. These findings provide insights for utilization of hardware-efficient subsampling strategies that balance data efficiency and task accuracy. The code for this paper will be released at: https://github.com/hesamaraghi/event-camera-subsampling-methods.

<title>Think Twice, Act Once: Token-Aware Compression and Action Reuse for Efficient Inference in Vision-Language-Action Models</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for general-purpose robot control through natural language instructions. However, their high inference cost-stemming from large-scale token computation and autoregressive decoding-poses significant challenges for real-time deployment and edge applications. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural optimization, we take a different perspective by identifying a dual form of redundancy in VLA models: (i) high similarity across consecutive action steps, and (ii) substantial redundancy in visual tokens. Motivated by these observations, we propose FlashVLA, the first training-free and plug-and-play acceleration framework that enables action reuse in VLA models. FlashVLA improves inference efficiency through a token-aware action reuse mechanism that avoids redundant decoding across stable action steps, and an information-guided visual token selection strategy that prunes low-contribution tokens. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that FlashVLA reduces FLOPs by 55.7% and latency by 36.0%, with only a 0.7% drop in task success rate. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FlashVLA in enabling lightweight, low-latency VLA inference without retraining.

<title>Sci-Fi: Symmetric Constraint for Frame Inbetweening</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21205</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21205</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frame inbetweening aims to synthesize intermediate video sequences conditioned on the given start and end frames. Current state-of-the-art methods mainly extend large-scale pre-trained Image-to-Video Diffusion models (I2V-DMs) by incorporating end-frame constraints via directly fine-tuning or omitting training. We identify a critical limitation in their design: Their injections of the end-frame constraint usually utilize the same mechanism that originally imposed the start-frame (single image) constraint. However, since the original I2V-DMs are adequately trained for the start-frame condition in advance, naively introducing the end-frame constraint by the same mechanism with much less (even zero) specialized training probably can't make the end frame have a strong enough impact on the intermediate content like the start frame. This asymmetric control strength of the two frames over the intermediate content likely leads to inconsistent motion or appearance collapse in generated frames. To efficiently achieve symmetric constraints of start and end frames, we propose a novel framework, termed Sci-Fi, which applies a stronger injection for the constraint of a smaller training scale. Specifically, it deals with the start-frame constraint as before, while introducing the end-frame constraint by an improved mechanism. The new mechanism is based on a well-designed lightweight module, named EF-Net, which encodes only the end frame and expands it into temporally adaptive frame-wise features injected into the I2V-DM. This makes the end-frame constraint as strong as the start-frame constraint, enabling our Sci-Fi to produce more harmonious transitions in various scenarios. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our Sci-Fi compared with other baselines.

<title>Is Hyperbolic Space All You Need for Medical Anomaly Detection?</title>

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection has emerged as a promising solution to challenges in data availability and labeling constraints. Traditional methods extract features from different layers of pre-trained networks in Euclidean space; however, Euclidean representations fail to effectively capture the hierarchical relationships within these features, leading to suboptimal anomaly detection performance. We propose a novel yet simple approach that projects feature representations into hyperbolic space, aggregates them based on confidence levels, and classifies samples as healthy or anomalous. Our experiments demonstrate that hyperbolic space consistently outperforms Euclidean-based frameworks, achieving higher AUROC scores at both image and pixel levels across multiple medical benchmark datasets. Additionally, we show that hyperbolic space exhibits resilience to parameter variations and excels in few-shot scenarios, where healthy images are scarce. These findings underscore the potential of hyperbolic space as a powerful alternative for medical anomaly detection. The project website can be found at https://hyperbolic-anomalies.github.io

<title>Occlusion Boundary and Depth: Mutual Enhancement via Multi-Task Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Occlusion Boundary Estimation (OBE) identifies boundaries arising from both inter-object occlusions and self-occlusion within individual objects, distinguishing intrinsic object edges from occlusion-induced contours to improve scene understanding and 3D reconstruction capacity. This is closely related to Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), which infers depth from a single image, as occlusion boundaries provide critical geometric cues for resolving depth ambiguities, while depth priors can conversely refine occlusion reasoning in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel network, MoDOT, that first jointly estimates depth and OBs. We propose CASM, a cross-attention multi-scale strip convolution module, leverages mid-level OB features to significantly enhance depth prediction. Additionally, we introduce an occlusion-aware loss function, OBDCL, which encourages sharper and more accurate depth boundaries. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the mutual benefits of jointly estimating depth and OB, and highlight the effectiveness of our model design. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on both our proposed synthetic datasets and one popular real dataset, NYUD-v2, significantly outperforming multi-task baselines. Besides, without domain adaptation, results on real-world depth transfer are comparable to the competitors, while preserving sharp occlusion boundaries for geometric fidelity. We will release our code, pre-trained models, and datasets to support future research in this direction.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current VLM-based VQA methods often process entire images, leading to excessive visual tokens that include redundant information irrelevant to the posed question. This abundance of unnecessary image details creates numerous visual tokens, drastically increasing memory and computational requirements in VLMs. To address this, we propose Contextual Region-Oriented Visual Token Pruning (CROP), a novel framework to compress visual tokens through a two-step process: Localization and Pruning. Specifically, CROP first employs an efficient model to identify the contextual region relevant to the input query. Subsequently, two distinct strategies are introduced for pruning: (1) Pre-LLM Compression (PLC), which adaptively compresses different image regions with varying ratios, and (2) Inner-LLM Pruning (ILP), a training-free method that prunes tokens within early LLM layers guided by the identified contextual region. Extensive experiments on a wide range of VQA tasks demonstrate that CROP significantly outperforms existing visual token pruning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code and datasets will be made available.

arXiv:2505.21238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis for underwater scene reconstruction presents unique challenges due to complex light-media interactions. Optical scattering and absorption in water body bring inhomogeneous medium attenuation interference that disrupts conventional volume rendering assumptions of uniform propagation medium. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers real-time rendering capabilities, it struggles with underwater inhomogeneous environments where scattering media introduce artifacts and inconsistent appearance. In this study, we propose a physics-based framework that disentangles object appearance from water medium effects through tailored Gaussian modeling. Our approach introduces appearance embeddings, which are explicit medium representations for backscatter and attenuation, enhancing scene consistency. In addition, we propose a distance-guided optimization strategy that leverages pseudo-depth maps as supervision with depth regularization and scale penalty terms to improve geometric fidelity. By integrating the proposed appearance and medium modeling components via an underwater imaging model, our approach achieves both high-quality novel view synthesis and physically accurate scene restoration. Experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in rendering quality and restoration accuracy over existing methods.

Abstract: We present Plenodium (plenoptic medium), an effective and efficient 3D representation framework capable of jointly modeling both objects and participating media. In contrast to existing medium representations that rely solely on view-dependent modeling, our novel plenoptic medium representation incorporates both directional and positional information through spherical harmonics encoding, enabling highly accurate underwater scene reconstruction. To address the initialization challenge in degraded underwater environments, we propose the pseudo-depth Gaussian complementation to augment COLMAP-derived point clouds with robust depth priors. In addition, a depth ranking regularized loss is developed to optimize the geometry of the scene and improve the ordinal consistency of the depth maps. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we conduct a simulated dataset with ground truth and the controllable scattering medium to demonstrate the restoration capability of our method in underwater scenarios. Our code and dataset are available at https://plenodium.github.io/.

Abstract: Balancing reconstruction quality versus model efficiency remains a critical challenge in lightweight single image super-resolution (SISR). Despite the prevalence of attention mechanisms in recent state-of-the-art SISR approaches that primarily emphasize or suppress feature maps, alternative architectural paradigms warrant further exploration. This paper introduces DiMoSR (Dilated Modulation Super-Resolution), a novel architecture that enhances feature representation through modulation to complement attention in lightweight SISR networks. The proposed approach leverages multi-branch dilated convolutions to capture rich contextual information over a wider receptive field while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that DiMoSR outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight methods across diverse benchmark datasets, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM metrics with comparable or reduced computational complexity. Through comprehensive ablation studies, this work not only validates the effectiveness of DiMoSR but also provides critical insights into the interplay between attention mechanisms and feature modulation to guide future research in efficient network design.

Abstract: Accurate wetland land-cover classification is essential for environmental monitoring, biodiversity assessment, and sustainable ecosystem management. However, the scarcity of annotated data, especially for high-resolution satellite imagery, poses a significant challenge for supervised learning approaches. To tackle this issue, this study presents a methodology for wetland land-cover segmentation and classification that adopts both supervised and self-supervised learning (SSL). We train a U-Net model from scratch on Sentinel-2 imagery across six wetland regions in the Netherlands, achieving a baseline model accuracy of 85.26%.
  Addressing the limited availability of labeled data, the results show that SSL pretraining with an autoencoder can improve accuracy, especially for the high-resolution imagery where it is more difficult to obtain labeled data, reaching an accuracy of 88.23%.
  Furthermore, we introduce a framework to scale manually annotated high-resolution labels to medium-resolution inputs. While the quantitative performance between resolutions is comparable, high-resolution imagery provides significantly sharper segmentation boundaries and finer spatial detail.
  As part of this work, we also contribute a curated Sentinel-2 dataset with Dynamic World labels, tailored for wetland classification tasks and made publicly available.

<title>Spectral Compression Transformer with Line Pose Graph for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21309</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based 3D human pose estimation methods suffer from high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length. Additionally, pose sequences often contain significant redundancy between frames. However, recent methods typically fail to improve model capacity while effectively eliminating sequence redundancy. In this work, we introduce the Spectral Compression Transformer (SCT) to reduce sequence length and accelerate computation. The SCT encoder treats hidden features between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the Discrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine the spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency noise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy. To further enrich the input sequence with prior structural information, we propose the Line Pose Graph (LPG) based on line graph theory. The LPG generates skeletal position information that complements the input 2D joint positions, thereby improving the model's performance. Finally, we design a dual-stream network architecture to effectively model spatial joint relationships and the compressed motion trajectory within the pose sequence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency. For example, on the Human3.6M dataset, our method achieves an MPJPE of 37.7mm while maintaining a low computational cost. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on each module to assess its effectiveness. The code and models will be released.

Abstract: Enhancing plant disease detection from leaf imagery remains a persistent challenge due to scarce labeled data and complex contextual factors. We introduce a transformative two-stage methodology, Mid Point Normalization (MPN) for intelligent image preprocessing, coupled with sophisticated attention mechanisms that dynamically recalibrate feature representations. Our classification pipeline, merging MPN with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, achieves remarkable 93% accuracy while maintaining exceptional class-wise balance. The perfect F1 score attained for our target class exemplifies attention's power in adaptive feature refinement. For segmentation tasks, we seamlessly integrate identical attention blocks within U-Net architecture using MPN-enhanced inputs, delivering compelling performance gains with 72.44% Dice score and 58.54% IoU, substantially outperforming baseline implementations. Beyond superior accuracy metrics, our approach yields computationally efficient, lightweight architectures perfectly suited for real-world computer vision applications.

Abstract: Video Virtual Try-On (VVT) aims to simulate the natural appearance of garments across consecutive video frames, capturing their dynamic variations and interactions with human body motion. However, current VVT methods still face challenges in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and garment content preservation. First, they use diffusion models based on the U-Net, which are limited in their expressive capability and struggle to reconstruct complex details. Second, they adopt a separative modeling approach for spatial and temporal attention, which hinders the effective capture of structural relationships and dynamic consistency across frames. Third, their expression of garment details remains insufficient, affecting the realism and stability of the overall synthesized results, especially during human motion. To address the above challenges, we propose MagicTryOn, a video virtual try-on framework built upon the large-scale video diffusion Transformer.We replace the U-Net architecture with a diffusion Transformer and combine full self-attention to jointly model the spatiotemporal consistency of videos. We design a coarse-to-fine garment preservation strategy. The coarse strategy integrates garment tokens during the embedding stage, while the fine strategy incorporates multiple garment-based conditions, such as semantics, textures, and contour lines during the denoising stage. Moreover, we introduce a mask-aware loss to further optimize garment region fidelity. Extensive experiments on both image and video try-on datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SOTA methods in comprehensive evaluations and generalizes to in-the-wild scenarios.

<title>MME-VideoOCR: Evaluating OCR-Based Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs in Video Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable accuracy in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from static images. However, their efficacy in video OCR is significantly diminished due to factors such as motion blur, temporal variations, and visual effects inherent in video content. To provide clearer guidance for training practical MLLMs, we introduce the MME-VideoOCR benchmark, which encompasses a comprehensive range of video OCR application scenarios. MME-VideoOCR features 10 task categories comprising 25 individual tasks and spans 44 diverse scenarios. These tasks extend beyond text recognition to incorporate deeper comprehension and reasoning of textual content within videos. The benchmark consists of 1,464 videos with varying resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, along with 2,000 meticulously curated, manually annotated question-answer pairs. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs on MME-VideoOCR, revealing that even the best-performing model (Gemini-2.5 Pro) achieves an accuracy of only 73.7%. Fine-grained analysis indicates that while existing MLLMs demonstrate strong performance on tasks where relevant texts are contained within a single or few frames, they exhibit limited capability in effectively handling tasks that demand holistic video comprehension. These limitations are especially evident in scenarios that require spatio-temporal reasoning, cross-frame information integration, or resistance to language prior bias. Our findings also highlight the importance of high-resolution visual input and sufficient temporal coverage for reliable OCR in dynamic video scenarios.

Abstract: Video large language models (video LLMs) excel at video comprehension but face significant computational inefficiency due to redundant video tokens. Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden. Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance. Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a 1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.

<title>Beyond Accuracy: Uncovering the Role of Similarity Perception and its Alignment with Semantics in Supervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Similarity manifests in various forms, including semantic similarity that is particularly important, serving as an approximation of human object categorization based on e.g. shared functionalities and evolutionary traits. It also offers practical advantages in computational modeling via lexical structures such as WordNet with constant and interpretable similarity. As in the domain of deep vision, there is still not enough focus on the phenomena regarding the similarity perception emergence. We introduce Deep Similarity Inspector (DSI) -- a systematic framework to inspect how deep vision networks develop their similarity perception and its alignment with semantic similarity. Our experiments show that both Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNNs) and Vision Transformers' (ViTs) develop a rich similarity perception during training with 3 phases (initial similarity surge, refinement, stabilization), with clear differences between CNNs and ViTs. Besides the gradual mistakes elimination, the mistakes refinement phenomenon can be observed.

<title>AgriFM: A Multi-source Temporal Remote Sensing Foundation Model for Crop Mapping</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21357</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics. Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction, leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations. This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at urlhttps://github.com/flyakon/AgriFM.

Abstract: Object detection in remote sensing imagery remains a challenging task due to extreme scale variation, dense object distributions, and cluttered backgrounds. While recent detectors such as YOLOv8 have shown promising results, their backbone architectures lack explicit mechanisms to guide multi-scale feature refinement, limiting performance on high-resolution aerial data. In this work, we propose YOLO-SPCI, an attention-enhanced detection framework that introduces a lightweight Selective-Perspective-Class Integration (SPCI) module to improve feature representation. The SPCI module integrates three components: a Selective Stream Gate (SSG) for adaptive regulation of global feature flow, a Perspective Fusion Module (PFM) for context-aware multi-scale integration, and a Class Discrimination Module (CDM) to enhance inter-class separability. We embed two SPCI blocks into the P3 and P5 stages of the YOLOv8 backbone, enabling effective refinement while preserving compatibility with the original neck and head. Experiments on the NWPU VHR-10 dataset demonstrate that YOLO-SPCI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art detectors.

<title>Video-Holmes: Can MLLM Think Like Holmes for Complex Video Reasoning?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21374</link>

arXiv:2505.21374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in CoT reasoning and RL post-training have been reported to enhance video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This progress naturally raises a question: can these models perform complex video reasoning in a manner comparable to human experts? However, existing video benchmarks primarily evaluate visual perception and grounding abilities, with questions that can be answered based on explicit prompts or isolated visual cues. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the intricacies of real-world reasoning, where humans must actively search for, integrate, and analyze multiple clues before reaching a conclusion. To address this issue, we present Video-Holmes, a benchmark inspired by the reasoning process of Sherlock Holmes, designed to evaluate the complex video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Video-Holmes consists of 1,837 questions derived from 270 manually annotated suspense short films, which spans seven carefully designed tasks. Each task is constructed by first identifying key events and causal relationships within films, and then designing questions that require models to actively locate and connect multiple relevant visual clues scattered across different video segments. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals that, while these models generally excel at visual perception, they encounter substantial difficulties with integrating information and often miss critical clues. For example, the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves an accuracy of only 45%, with most models scoring below 40%. We aim that Video-Holmes can serve as a "Holmes-test" for multimodal reasoning, motivating models to reason more like humans and emphasizing the ongoing challenges in this field. The benchmark is released in https://github.com/TencentARC/Video-Holmes.

arXiv:2505.21375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) imagery offers valuable data for Earth observation but pose challenges for existing multimodal foundation models due to two key bottlenecks: (1) limited availability of UHR training data, and (2) token explosion caused by the large image size. To address data scarcity, we introduce SuperRS-VQA (avg. 8,376$\times$8,376) and HighRS-VQA (avg. 2,000$\times$1,912), the highest-resolution vision-language datasets in RS to date, covering 22 real-world dialogue tasks. To mitigate token explosion, our pilot studies reveal significant redundancy in RS images: crucial information is concentrated in a small subset of object-centric tokens, while pruning background tokens (e.g., ocean or forest) can even improve performance. Motivated by these findings, we propose two strategies: Background Token Pruning and Anchored Token Selection, to reduce the memory footprint while preserving key semantics.Integrating these techniques, we introduce GeoLLaVA-8K, the first RS-focused multimodal large language model capable of handling inputs up to 8K$\times$8K resolution, built on the LLaVA framework. Trained on SuperRS-VQA and HighRS-VQA, GeoLLaVA-8K sets a new state-of-the-art on the XLRS-Bench.

arXiv:2505.21377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel text-to-vector graphics generation approach, Dream3DVG, allowing for arbitrary viewpoint viewing, progressive detail optimization, and view-dependent occlusion awareness. Our approach is a dual-branch optimization framework, consisting of an auxiliary 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization branch and a 3D vector graphics optimization branch. The introduced 3DGS branch can bridge the domain gaps between text prompts and vector graphics with more consistent guidance. Moreover, 3DGS allows for progressive detail control by scheduling classifier-free guidance, facilitating guiding vector graphics with coarse shapes at the initial stages and finer details at later stages. We also improve the view-dependent occlusions by devising a visibility-awareness rendering module. Extensive results on 3D sketches and 3D iconographies, demonstrate the superiority of the method on different abstraction levels of details, cross-view consistency, and occlusion-aware stroke culling.

<title>ZigzagPointMamba: Spatial-Semantic Mamba for Point Cloud Understanding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.

arXiv:2505.21387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representation learning capabilities, deep multi-view clustering methods have demonstrated reliable performance by effectively integrating multi-source information from diverse views in recent years. Most existing methods rely on the assumption of clean views. However, noise is pervasive in real-world scenarios, leading to a significant degradation in performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel multi-view clustering framework for the automatic identification and rectification of noisy data, termed AIRMVC. Specifically, we reformulate noisy identification as an anomaly identification problem using GMM. We then design a hybrid rectification strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy data based on the identification results. Furthermore, we introduce a noise-robust contrastive mechanism to generate reliable representations. Additionally, we provide a theoretical proof demonstrating that these representations can discard noisy information, thereby improving the performance of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that AIRMVC outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of robustness in noisy scenarios. The code of AIRMVC are available at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/AIRMVC on Github.

Abstract: Multimodal feature reconstruction is a promising approach for 3D anomaly detection, leveraging the complementary information from dual modalities. We further advance this paradigm by utilizing multi-modal mentor learning, which fuses intermediate features to further distinguish normal from feature differences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called Mentor3AD, which utilizes multi-modal mentor learning. By leveraging the shared features of different modalities, Mentor3AD can extract more effective features and guide feature reconstruction, ultimately improving detection performance. Specifically, Mentor3AD includes a Mentor of Fusion Module (MFM) that merges features extracted from RGB and 3D modalities to create a mentor feature. Additionally, we have designed a Mentor of Guidance Module (MGM) to facilitate cross-modal reconstruction, supported by the mentor feature. Lastly, we introduce a Voting Module (VM) to more accurately generate the final anomaly score. Extensive comparative and ablation studies on MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Lip synchronization is the task of aligning a speaker's lip movements in video with corresponding speech audio, and it is essential for creating realistic, expressive video content. However, existing methods often rely on reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content. In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues, lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.

Abstract: Retrieving semantically similar but visually distinct contents has been a critical capability in visual search systems. In this work, we aim to tackle this problem with Visual Product Graph (VPG), leveraging high-performance infrastructure for storage and state-of-the-art computer vision models for image understanding. VPG is built to be an online real-time retrieval system that enables navigation from individual products to composite scenes containing those products, along with complementary recommendations. Our system not only offers contextual insights by showcasing how products can be styled in a context, but also provides recommendations for complementary products drawn from these inspirations. We discuss the essential components for building the Visual Product Graph, along with the core computer vision model improvements across object detection, foundational visual embeddings, and other visual signals. Our system achieves a 78.8% extremely similar@1 in end-to-end human relevance evaluations, and a 6% module engagement rate. The "Ways to Style It" module, powered by the Visual Product Graph technology, is deployed in production at Pinterest.

Abstract: Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention. However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence, there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding, and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in MLLMs.

arXiv:2505.21465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, a prevalent approach for enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) performance is to encode both the high-resolution version and the thumbnail of an image simultaneously. While effective, this method generates a large number of image tokens. When combined with the widely used Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), its long-term decay property hinders the interaction between high-resolution tokens and thumbnail tokens, as well as between text and image. To address these issues, we propose ID-Align, which alleviates these problems by reordering position IDs. In this method, high-resolution tokens inherit IDs from their corresponding thumbnail token while constraining the overexpansion of positional indices. Our experiments conducted within the LLaVA-Next framework demonstrate that ID-Align achieves significant improvements, including a 6.09% enhancement on MMBench's relation reasoning tasks and notable gains across multiple benchmarks. Our code is available at the following link: https://github.com/zooblastlbz/ID-Align.

<title>Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Adaptive Attention Calibration</title>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance on multimodal tasks but often suffer from hallucination, and confidently describe objects or attributes not present in the image. Current inference-time interventions, while training-free, struggle to maintain accuracy in open-ended and long-form generation scenarios. We introduce the Confidence-Aware Attention Calibration (CAAC) framework to address this challenge by targeting two key biases: spatial perception bias, which distributes attention disproportionately across image tokens, and modality bias, which shifts focus from visual to textual inputs over time. CAAC employs a two-step approach: Visual-Token Calibration (VTC) to balance attention across visual tokens, and Adaptive Attention Re-Scaling (AAR) to reinforce visual grounding based on the model's confidence. This confidence-driven adjustment ensures consistent visual alignment during generation. Experiments on CHAIR, AMBER, and POPE benchmarks demonstrate that CAAC outperforms baselines, particularly in long-form generations, effectively reducing hallucination.

<title>DetailFlow: 1D Coarse-to-Fine Autoregressive Image Generation via Next-Detail Prediction</title>

arXiv:2505.21473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents DetailFlow, a coarse-to-fine 1D autoregressive (AR) image generation method that models images through a novel next-detail prediction strategy. By learning a resolution-aware token sequence supervised with progressively degraded images, DetailFlow enables the generation process to start from the global structure and incrementally refine details. This coarse-to-fine 1D token sequence aligns well with the autoregressive inference mechanism, providing a more natural and efficient way for the AR model to generate complex visual content. Our compact 1D AR model achieves high-quality image synthesis with significantly fewer tokens than previous approaches, i.e. VAR/VQGAN. We further propose a parallel inference mechanism with self-correction that accelerates generation speed by approximately 8x while reducing accumulation sampling error inherent in teacher-forcing supervision. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, our method achieves 2.96 gFID with 128 tokens, outperforming VAR (3.3 FID) and FlexVAR (3.05 FID), which both require 680 tokens in their AR models. Moreover, due to the significantly reduced token count and parallel inference mechanism, our method runs nearly 2x faster inference speed compared to VAR and FlexVAR. Extensive experimental results demonstrate DetailFlow's superior generation quality and efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has evolved beyond single monolithic models to complex multi-component pipelines. These combine fine-tuned generators, adapters, upscaling blocks and even editing steps, leading to significant improvements in image quality. However, their effective design requires substantial expertise. Recent approaches have shown promise in automating this process through large language models (LLMs), but they suffer from two critical limitations: extensive computational requirements from generating images with hundreds of predefined pipelines, and poor generalization beyond memorized training examples. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based framework that addresses these inefficiencies. Our approach first trains an ensemble of reward models capable of predicting image quality scores directly from prompt-workflow combinations, eliminating the need for costly image generation during training. We then implement a two-phase training strategy: initial workflow vocabulary training followed by GRPO-based optimization that guides the model toward higher-performing regions of the workflow space. Additionally, we incorporate a classifier-free guidance based enhancement technique that extrapolates along the path between the initial and GRPO-tuned models, further improving output quality. We validate our approach through a set of comparisons, showing that it can successfully create new flows with greater diversity and lead to superior image quality compared to existing baselines.

<title>MV-CoLight: Efficient Object Compositing with Consistent Lighting and Shadow Generation</title>

Abstract: Object compositing offers significant promise for augmented reality (AR) and embodied intelligence applications. Existing approaches predominantly focus on single-image scenarios or intrinsic decomposition techniques, facing challenges with multi-view consistency, complex scenes, and diverse lighting conditions. Recent inverse rendering advancements, such as 3D Gaussian and diffusion-based methods, have enhanced consistency but are limited by scalability, heavy data requirements, or prolonged reconstruction time per scene. To broaden its applicability, we introduce MV-CoLight, a two-stage framework for illumination-consistent object compositing in both 2D images and 3D scenes. Our novel feed-forward architecture models lighting and shadows directly, avoiding the iterative biases of diffusion-based methods. We employ a Hilbert curve-based mapping to align 2D image inputs with 3D Gaussian scene representations seamlessly. To facilitate training and evaluation, we further introduce a large-scale 3D compositing dataset. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art harmonized results across standard benchmarks and our dataset, as well as casually captured real-world scenes demonstrate the framework's robustness and wide generalization.

<title>Be Decisive: Noise-Induced Layouts for Multi-Subject Generation</title>

Abstract: Generating multiple distinct subjects remains a challenge for existing text-to-image diffusion models. Complex prompts often lead to subject leakage, causing inaccuracies in quantities, attributes, and visual features. Preventing leakage among subjects necessitates knowledge of each subject's spatial location. Recent methods provide these spatial locations via an external layout control. However, enforcing such a prescribed layout often conflicts with the innate layout dictated by the sampled initial noise, leading to misalignment with the model's prior. In this work, we introduce a new approach that predicts a spatial layout aligned with the prompt, derived from the initial noise, and refines it throughout the denoising process. By relying on this noise-induced layout, we avoid conflicts with externally imposed layouts and better preserve the model's prior. Our method employs a small neural network to predict and refine the evolving noise-induced layout at each denoising step, ensuring clear boundaries between subjects while maintaining consistency. Experimental results show that this noise-aligned strategy achieves improved text-image alignment and more stable multi-subject generation compared to existing layout-guided techniques, while preserving the rich diversity of the model's original distribution.

Abstract: Controllability, temporal coherence, and detail synthesis remain the most critical challenges in video generation. In this paper, we focus on a commonly used yet underexplored cinematic technique known as Frame In and Frame Out. Specifically, starting from image-to-video generation, users can control the objects in the image to naturally leave the scene or provide breaking new identity references to enter the scene, guided by user-specified motion trajectory. To support this task, we introduce a new dataset curated semi-automatically, a comprehensive evaluation protocol targeting this setting, and an efficient identity-preserving motion-controllable video Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing baselines.

<title>Adversarial Attacks against Closed-Source MLLMs via Feature Optimal Alignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21494</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain vulnerable to transferable adversarial examples. While existing methods typically achieve targeted attacks by aligning global features-such as CLIP's [CLS] token-between adversarial and target samples, they often overlook the rich local information encoded in patch tokens. This leads to suboptimal alignment and limited transferability, particularly for closed-source models. To address this limitation, we propose a targeted transferable adversarial attack method based on feature optimal alignment, called FOA-Attack, to improve adversarial transfer capability. Specifically, at the global level, we introduce a global feature loss based on cosine similarity to align the coarse-grained features of adversarial samples with those of target samples. At the local level, given the rich local representations within Transformers, we leverage clustering techniques to extract compact local patterns to alleviate redundant local features. We then formulate local feature alignment between adversarial and target samples as an optimal transport (OT) problem and propose a local clustering optimal transport loss to refine fine-grained feature alignment. Additionally, we propose a dynamic ensemble model weighting strategy to adaptively balance the influence of multiple models during adversarial example generation, thereby further improving transferability. Extensive experiments across various models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially in transferring to closed-source MLLMs. The code is released at https://github.com/jiaxiaojunQAQ/FOA-Attack.

Abstract: Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on (i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably (iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated poster-generation models. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Paper2Poster/Paper2Poster.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning. We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for visual processing tasks, demonstrating excellent scalability with increased training data and model size. However, recent work has identified the emergence of artifact tokens in ViTs that are incongruous with the local semantics. These anomalous tokens degrade ViT performance in tasks that require fine-grained localization or structural coherence. An effective mitigation of this issue is to the addition of register tokens to ViTs, which implicitly "absorb" the artifact term during training. Given the availability of various large-scale pre-trained ViTs, in this paper we aim at equipping them with such register tokens without the need of re-training them from scratch, which is infeasible considering their size. Specifically, we propose Post Hoc Registers (PH-Reg), an efficient self-distillation method that integrates registers into an existing ViT without requiring additional labeled data and full retraining. PH-Reg initializes both teacher and student networks from the same pre-trained ViT. The teacher remains frozen and unmodified, while the student is augmented with randomly initialized register tokens. By applying test-time augmentation to the teacher's inputs, we generate denoised dense embeddings free of artifacts, which are then used to optimize only a small subset of unlocked student weights. We show that our approach can effectively reduce the number of artifact tokens, improving the segmentation and depth prediction of the student ViT under zero-shot and linear probing.

Abstract: We propose GRGS, a generalizable and relightable 3D Gaussian framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis under diverse lighting conditions. Unlike existing methods that rely on per-character optimization or ignore physical constraints, GRGS adopts a feed-forward, fully supervised strategy that projects geometry, material, and illumination cues from multi-view 2D observations into 3D Gaussian representations. Specifically, to reconstruct lighting-invariant geometry, we introduce a Lighting-aware Geometry Refinement (LGR) module trained on synthetically relit data to predict accurate depth and surface normals. Based on the high-quality geometry, a Physically Grounded Neural Rendering (PGNR) module is further proposed to integrate neural prediction with physics-based shading, supporting editable relighting with shadows and indirect illumination. Besides, we design a 2D-to-3D projection training scheme that leverages differentiable supervision from ambient occlusion, direct, and indirect lighting maps, which alleviates the computational cost of explicit ray tracing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRGS achieves superior visual quality, geometric consistency, and generalization across characters and lighting conditions.

<title>Beyond Prompt Engineering: Robust Behavior Control in LLMs via Steering Target Atoms</title>

Abstract: Precise control over language model generation is vital for ensuring both safety and reliability. Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE) to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However, these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial scenarios. We also apply the steering strategy to the large reasoning model, confirming its effectiveness in precise reasoning control.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse cultural contexts, yet their internal biases remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose a novel framework to systematically evaluate how VLMs encode cultural differences and biases related to race, gender, and physical traits across countries. We introduce three retrieval-based tasks: (1) Race to Country retrieval, which examines the association between individuals from specific racial groups (East Asian, White, Middle Eastern, Latino, South Asian, and Black) and different countries; (2) Personal Traits to Country retrieval, where images are paired with trait-based prompts (e.g., Smart, Honest, Criminal, Violent) to investigate potential stereotypical associations; and (3) Physical Characteristics to Country retrieval, focusing on visual attributes like skinny, young, obese, and old to explore how physical appearances are culturally linked to nations. Our findings reveal persistent biases in VLMs, highlighting how visual representations may inadvertently reinforce societal stereotypes.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are powerful generative models but remain computationally intensive due to their iterative structure and deep transformer stacks. To alleviate this inefficiency, we propose FastCache, a hidden-state-level caching and compression framework that accelerates DiT inference by exploiting redundancy within the model's internal representations. FastCache introduces a dual strategy: (1) a spatial-aware token selection mechanism that adaptively filters redundant tokens based on hidden state saliency, and (2) a transformer-level cache that reuses latent activations across timesteps when changes are statistically insignificant. These modules work jointly to reduce unnecessary computation while preserving generation fidelity through learnable linear approximation. Theoretical analysis shows that FastCache maintains bounded approximation error under a hypothesis-testing-based decision rule. Empirical evaluations across multiple DiT variants demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and memory usage, with best generation output quality compared to other cache methods, as measured by FID and t-FID. Code implementation of FastCache is available on GitHub at https://github.com/NoakLiu/FastCache-xDiT.

Abstract: Landing safely in crowded urban environments remains an essential yet challenging endeavor for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), especially in emergency situations. In this work, we propose a risk-aware approach that harnesses semantic segmentation to continuously evaluate potential hazards in the drone's field of view. By using a specialized deep neural network to assign pixel-level risk values and applying an algorithm based on risk maps, our method adaptively identifies a stable Safe Landing Zone (SLZ) despite moving critical obstacles such as vehicles, people, etc., and other visual challenges like shifting illumination. A control system then guides the UAV toward this low-risk region, employing altitude-dependent safety thresholds and temporal landing point stabilization to ensure robust descent trajectories. Experimental validation in diverse urban environments demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving over 90% landing success rates in very challenging real scenarios, showing significant improvements in various risk metrics. Our findings suggest that risk-oriented vision methods can effectively help reduce the risk of accidents in emergency landing situations, particularly in complex, unstructured, urban scenarios, densely populated with moving risky obstacles, while potentiating the true capabilities of UAVs in complex urban operations.

Abstract: This paper introduces PreP-OCR, a two-stage pipeline that combines document image restoration with semantic-aware post-OCR correction to improve text extraction from degraded historical documents. Our key innovation lies in jointly optimizing image clarity and linguistic consistency. First, we generate synthetic image pairs with randomized text fonts, layouts, and degradations. An image restoration model is trained on this synthetic data, using multi-directional patch extraction and fusion to process large images. Second, a ByT5 post-corrector, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text training pairs, addresses any remaining OCR errors. Detailed experiments on 13,831 pages of real historical documents in English, French, and Spanish show that PreP-OCR pipeline reduces character error rates by 63.9-70.3\% compared to OCR on raw images. Our pipeline demonstrates the potential of integrating image restoration with linguistic error correction for digitizing historical archives.

Abstract: We introduce a 3D detailizer, a neural model which can instantaneously (in <1s) transform a coarse 3D shape proxy into a high-quality asset with detailed geometry and texture as guided by an input text prompt. Our model is trained using the text prompt, which defines the shape class and characterizes the appearance and fine-grained style of the generated details. The coarse 3D proxy, which can be easily varied and adjusted (e.g., via user editing), provides structure control over the final shape. Importantly, our detailizer is not optimized for a single shape; it is the result of distilling a generative model, so that it can be reused, without retraining, to generate any number of shapes, with varied structures, whose local details all share a consistent style and appearance. Our detailizer training utilizes a pretrained multi-view image diffusion model, with text conditioning, to distill the foundational knowledge therein into our detailizer via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To improve SDS and enable our detailizer architecture to learn generalizable features over complex structures, we train our model in two training stages to generate shapes with increasing structural complexity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method generates shapes of superior quality and details compared to existing text-to-3D models under varied structure control. Our detailizer can refine a coarse shape in less than a second, making it possible to interactively author and adjust 3D shapes. Furthermore, the user-imposed structure control can lead to creative, and hence out-of-distribution, 3D asset generations that are beyond the current capabilities of leading text-to-3D generative models. We demonstrate an interactive 3D modeling workflow our method enables, and its strong generalizability over styles, structures, and object categories.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios, particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs), extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However, these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs. HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic modeling over arbitrarily long context, and a dynamic temporal scaling mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/hrlics/HoPE.

Abstract: Neural fields are a highly effective representation across visual computing. This work observes that fitting these fields is greatly improved by incorporating spatial stochasticity during training, and that this simple technique can replace or even outperform custom-designed hierarchies and frequency space constructions. The approach is formalized as implicitly operating on a blurred version of the field, evaluated in-expectation by sampling with Gaussian-distributed offsets. Querying the blurred field during optimization greatly improves convergence and robustness, akin to the role of preconditioners in numerical linear algebra. This implicit, sampling-based perspective fits naturally into the neural field paradigm, comes at no additional cost, and is extremely simple to implement. We describe the basic theory of this technique, including details such as handling boundary conditions, and extending to a spatially-varying blur. Experiments demonstrate this approach on representations including coordinate MLPs, neural hashgrids, triplanes, and more, across tasks including surface reconstruction and radiance fields. In settings where custom-designed hierarchies have already been developed, stochastic preconditioning nearly matches or improves their performance with a simple and unified approach; in settings without existing hierarchies it provides an immediate boost to quality and robustness.

<title>Avoid Forgetting by Preserving Global Knowledge Gradients in Federated Learning with Non-IID Data</title>

Abstract: The inevitable presence of data heterogeneity has made federated learning very challenging. There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as local regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though effective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect the global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing an experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example. Our observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer from forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn the perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights, and clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained optimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning framework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its forgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion, we design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further calibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of learned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an episodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to regulate the gradient updates at each step of local training. Experimental results demonstrate that FedProj outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in foundation models, including Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, and Vision-Language-Action Models have opened new avenues for embodied AI in mobile service robotics. By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and examining how foundation models can address them. Namely, we explore the role of such models in enabling real-time sensor fusion, language-conditioned control, and adaptive task execution. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on service robotics. We also include potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient, and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is an important task in data engineering. However, most UFS methods construct models from a single perspective and often fail to simultaneously evaluate feature importance and preserve their inherent data structure, thus limiting their performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel bi-level unsupervised feature selection (BLUFS) method, including a clustering level and a feature level. Specifically, at the clustering level, spectral clustering is used to generate pseudo-labels for representing the data structure, while a continuous linear regression model is developed to learn the projection matrix. At the feature level, the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm constraint is imposed on the projection matrix for more effectively selecting features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine a bi-level framework with the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm. To solve the proposed bi-level model, we design an efficient proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm, whose subproblems either have explicit solutions or can be computed by fast solvers. Furthermore, we establish the convergence result and computational complexity. Finally, extensive experiments on two synthetic datasets and eight real datasets demonstrate the superiority of BLUFS in clustering and classification tasks.

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit impressive capabilities for general multimodal tasks, specialized domains like music necessitate tailored approaches. Music Audio-Visual Question Answering (Music AVQA) particularly underscores this, presenting unique challenges with its continuous, densely layered audio-visual content, intricate temporal dynamics, and the critical need for domain-specific knowledge. Through a systematic analysis of Music AVQA datasets and methods, this position paper identifies that specialized input processing, architectures incorporating dedicated spatial-temporal designs, and music-specific modeling strategies are critical for success in this domain. Our study provides valuable insights for researchers by highlighting effective design patterns empirically linked to strong performance, proposing concrete future directions for incorporating musical priors, and aiming to establish a robust foundation for advancing multimodal musical understanding. This work is intended to inspire broader attention and further research, supported by a continuously updated anonymous GitHub repository of relevant papers: https://github.com/xid32/Survey4MusicAVQA.

<title>A False Discovery Rate Control Method Using a Fully Connected Hidden Markov Random Field for Neuroimaging Data</title>

Abstract: False discovery rate (FDR) control methods are essential for voxel-wise multiple testing in neuroimaging data analysis, where hundreds of thousands or even millions of tests are conducted to detect brain regions associated with disease-related changes. Classical FDR control methods (e.g., BH, q-value, and LocalFDR) assume independence among tests and often lead to high false non-discovery rates (FNR). Although various spatial FDR control methods have been developed to improve power, they still fall short in jointly addressing three major challenges in neuroimaging applications: capturing complex spatial dependencies, maintaining low variability in both false discovery proportion (FDP) and false non-discovery proportion (FNP) across replications, and achieving computational scalability for high-resolution data. To address these challenges, we propose fcHMRF-LIS, a powerful, stable, and scalable spatial FDR control method for voxel-wise multiple testing. It integrates the local index of significance (LIS)-based testing procedure with a novel fully connected hidden Markov random field (fcHMRF) designed to model complex spatial structures using a parsimonious parameterization. We develop an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm incorporating mean-field approximation, the Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) technique, and permutohedral lattice filtering, reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of tests. Extensive simulations demonstrate that fcHMRF-LIS achieves accurate FDR control, lower FNR, reduced variability in FDP and FNP, and a higher number of true positives compared to existing methods. Applied to an FDG-PET dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, fcHMRF-LIS identifies neurobiologically relevant brain regions and offers notable advantages in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has recently witnessed advancements with Transformer-based models. Especially, ActionFormer shows us a new perspectives for HAR in the sense that this approach gives us additional outputs which detect the border of the activities as well as the activity labels. ActionFormer was originally proposed with its input as image/video. However, this was converted to with its input as sensor signals as well. We analyze this extensively in terms of deep learning architectures. Based on the report of high temporal dynamics which limits the model's ability to capture subtle changes effectively and of the interdependencies between the spatial and temporal features. We propose the modified ActionFormer which will decrease these defects for sensor signals. The key to our approach lies in accordance with the Sequence-and-Excitation strategy to minimize the increase in additional parameters and opt for the swish activation function to retain the information about direction in the negative range. Experiments on the WEAR dataset show that our method achieves substantial improvement of a 16.01\% in terms of average mAP for inertial data.

Abstract: This work introduces Ui2i, a novel model for unpaired image-to-image translation, trained on content-wise unpaired datasets to enable style transfer across domains while preserving content. Building on CycleGAN, Ui2i incorporates key modifications to better disentangle content and style features, and preserve content integrity. Specifically, Ui2i employs U-Net-based generators with skip connections to propagate localized shallow features deep into the generator. Ui2i removes feature-based normalization layers from all modules and replaces them with approximate bidirectional spectral normalization -- a parameter-based alternative that enhances training stability. To further support content preservation, channel and spatial attention mechanisms are integrated into the generators. Training is facilitated through image scale augmentation. Evaluation on two biomedical tasks -- domain adaptation for nuclear segmentation in immunohistochemistry (IHC) images and unmixing of biological structures superimposed in single-channel immunofluorescence (IF) images -- demonstrates Ui2i's ability to preserve content fidelity in settings that demand more accurate structural preservation than typical translation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Ui2i is the first approach capable of separating superimposed signals in IF images using real, unpaired training data.

<title>Uni-Instruct: One-step Diffusion Model through Unified Diffusion Divergence Instruction</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}. Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

Abstract: Transformers have reshaped machine learning by utilizing attention mechanisms to capture complex patterns in large datasets, leading to significant improvements in performance. This success has contributed to the belief that "bigger means better", leading to ever-increasing model sizes. This paper challenge this ideology by showing that many existing transformers might be unnecessarily oversized. We discover a theoretical principle that redefines the role of multi-head attention. An important benefit of the multiple heads is in improving the conditioning of the attention block. We exploit this theoretical insight and redesign popular architectures with an increased number of heads. The improvement in the conditioning proves so significant in practice that model depth can be decreased, reducing the parameter count by up to 30-50% while maintaining accuracy. We obtain consistent benefits across a variety of transformer-based architectures of various scales, on tasks in computer vision (ImageNet-1k) as well as language and sequence modeling (GLUE benchmark, TinyStories, and the Long-Range Arena benchmark).

Abstract: Retinal imaging has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive modality for detecting and quantifying biomarkers of systemic diseases-ranging from diabetes and hypertension to Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disorders but current insights remain dispersed across platforms and specialties. Recent technological advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT/OCTA) and adaptive optics (AO) now deliver ultra-high-resolution scans (down to 5 {\mu}m ) with superior contrast and spatial integration, allowing early identification of microvascular abnormalities and neurodegenerative changes. At the same time, AI-driven and machine learning (ML) algorithms have revolutionized the analysis of large-scale retinal datasets, increasing sensitivity and specificity; for example, deep learning models achieve > 90 \% sensitivity for diabetic retinopathy and AUC = 0.89 for the prediction of cardiovascular risk from fundus photographs. The proliferation of mobile health technologies and telemedicine platforms further extends access, reduces costs, and facilitates community-based screening and longitudinal monitoring. Despite these breakthroughs, translation into routine practice is hindered by heterogeneous imaging protocols, limited external validation of AI models, and integration challenges within clinical workflows. In this review, we systematically synthesize the latest OCT/OCT and AO developments, AI/ML approaches, and mHealth/Tele-ophthalmology initiatives and quantify their diagnostic performance across disease domains. Finally, we propose a roadmap for multicenter protocol standardization, prospective validation trials, and seamless incorporation of retinal screening into primary and specialty care pathways-paving the way for precision prevention, early intervention, and ongoing treatment of life-threatening systemic diseases.

Abstract: Achieving generalizable and precise robotic manipulation across diverse environments remains a critical challenge, largely due to limitations in spatial perception. While prior imitation-learning approaches have made progress, their reliance on raw RGB inputs and handcrafted features often leads to overfitting and poor 3D reasoning under varied lighting, occlusion, and object conditions. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that couples robust multimodal perception with reliable grasp prediction. Our architecture fuses domain-randomized augmentation, monocular depth estimation, and a depth-aware 6-DoF Grasp Prompt into a single spatial representation for downstream action planning. Conditioned on this encoding and a high-level task prompt, our diffusion-based policy yields precise action sequences, achieving up to 40% improvement in grasp success and 45% higher task success rates under environmental variation. These results demonstrate that spatially grounded perception, paired with diffusion-based imitation learning, offers a scalable and robust solution for general-purpose robotic grasping.

Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing can capture dynamical evolution of materials. Despite its capability, current methods emphasize variability of endmembers while neglecting dynamics of abundances, which motivates our adoption of neural ordinary differential equations to model abundances temporally. However, this motivation is hindered by two challenges: the inherent complexity in defining, modeling and solving problem, and the absence of theoretical support. To address above challenges, in this paper, we propose a multitemporal latent dynamical (MiLD) unmixing framework by capturing dynamical evolution of materials with theoretical validation. For addressing multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing, MiLD consists of problem definition, mathematical modeling, solution algorithm and theoretical support. We formulate multitemporal unmixing problem definition by conducting ordinary differential equations and developing latent variables. We transfer multitemporal unmixing to mathematical model by dynamical discretization approaches, which describe the discreteness of observed sequence images with mathematical expansions. We propose algorithm to solve problem and capture dynamics of materials, which approximates abundance evolution by neural networks. Furthermore, we provide theoretical support by validating the crucial properties, which verifies consistency, convergence and stability theorems. The major contributions of MiLD include defining problem by ordinary differential equations, modeling problem by dynamical discretization approach, solving problem by multitemporal unmixing algorithm, and presenting theoretical support. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have validated the utility of our work

Abstract: Learning visual representations from observing actions to benefit robot visuo-motor policy generation is a promising direction that closely resembles human cognitive function and perception. Motivated by this, and further inspired by psychological theories suggesting that humans process scenes in an object-based fashion, we propose an object-centric encoder that performs semantic segmentation and visual representation generation in a coupled manner, unlike other works, which treat these as separate processes. To achieve this, we leverage the Slot Attention mechanism and use the SOLV model, pretrained in large out-of-domain datasets, to bootstrap fine-tuning on human action video data. Through simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that visual representations can enhance reinforcement and imitation learning training, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated approach for semantic segmentation and encoding. Furthermore, we show that exploiting models pretrained on out-of-domain datasets can benefit this process, and that fine-tuning on datasets depicting human actions -- although still out-of-domain -- , can significantly improve performance due to close alignment with robotic tasks. These findings show the capability to reduce reliance on annotated or robot-specific action datasets and the potential to build on existing visual encoders to accelerate training and improve generalizability.

Abstract: While learned image compression (LIC) focuses on efficient data transmission, generative image compression (GIC) extends this framework by integrating generative modeling to produce photo-realistic reconstructed images. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based generative modeling framework tailored for generative image compression. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that indirectly exploit diffusion modeling, we reinterpret the compression process itself as a forward diffusion path governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A reverse neural network is trained to reconstruct images by reversing the compression process directly, without requiring Gaussian noise initialization. This approach achieves smooth rate adjustment and photo-realistic reconstructions with only a minimal number of sampling steps. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generative image compression approaches across a range of metrics, including perceptual distortion, statistical fidelity, and no-reference quality assessments.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of large-scale urban scenes is critical for applications such as AR navigation, UAV based inspection, and smart city digital twins. While aerial imagery offers broad coverage and complements limitations of ground-based data, reconstructing city-scale environments from such views remains challenging due to occlusions, incomplete geometry, and high memory demands. Recent advances like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) improve scalability and visual quality but remain limited by dense primitive usage, long training times, and poor suit ability for edge devices. We propose CityGo, a hybrid framework that combines textured proxy geometry with residual and surrounding 3D Gaussians for lightweight, photorealistic rendering of urban scenes from aerial perspectives. Our approach first extracts compact building proxy meshes from MVS point clouds, then uses zero order SH Gaussians to generate occlusion-free textures via image-based rendering and back-projection. To capture high-frequency details, we introduce residual Gaussians placed based on proxy-photo discrepancies and guided by depth priors. Broader urban context is represented by surrounding Gaussians, with importance-aware downsampling applied to non-critical regions to reduce redundancy. A tailored optimization strategy jointly refines proxy textures and Gaussian parameters, enabling real-time rendering of complex urban scenes on mobile GPUs with significantly reduced training and memory requirements. Extensive experiments on real-world aerial datasets demonstrate that our hybrid representation significantly reduces training time, achieving on average 1.4x speedup, while delivering comparable visual fidelity to pure 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches. Furthermore, CityGo enables real-time rendering of large-scale urban scenes on mobile consumer GPUs, with substantially reduced memory usage and energy consumption.

Abstract: Procedural texts help AI enhance reasoning about context and action sequences. Transforming these into Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) improves understanding of individual steps by identifying predicate-argument structure like {verb,what,where/with}. Procedural instructions are highly elliptic, for instance, (i) add cucumber to the bowl and (ii) add sliced tomatoes, the second step's where argument is inferred from the context, referring to where the cucumber was placed. Prior SRL benchmarks often miss implicit arguments, leading to incomplete understanding. To address this, we introduce Implicit-VidSRL, a dataset that necessitates inferring implicit and explicit arguments from contextual information in multimodal cooking procedures. Our proposed dataset benchmarks multimodal models' contextual reasoning, requiring entity tracking through visual changes in recipes. We study recent multimodal LLMs and reveal that they struggle to predict implicit arguments of what and where/with from multi-modal procedural data given the verb. Lastly, we propose iSRL-Qwen2-VL, which achieves a 17% relative improvement in F1-score for what-implicit and a 14.7% for where/with-implicit semantic roles over GPT-4o.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models raise ethical and safety concerns due to their potential to generate inappropriate or harmful images. Evaluating these models' security through red-teaming is vital, yet white-box approaches are limited by their need for internal access, complicating their use with closed-source models. Moreover, existing black-box methods often assume knowledge about the model's specific defense mechanisms, limiting their utility in real-world commercial API scenarios. A significant challenge is how to evade unknown and diverse defense mechanisms. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel Rule-based Preference modeling Guided Red-Teaming (RPG-RT), which iteratively employs LLM to modify prompts to query and leverages feedback from T2I systems for fine-tuning the LLM. RPG-RT treats the feedback from each iteration as a prior, enabling the LLM to dynamically adapt to unknown defense mechanisms. Given that the feedback is often labeled and coarse-grained, making it difficult to utilize directly, we further propose rule-based preference modeling, which employs a set of rules to evaluate desired or undesired feedback, facilitating finer-grained control over the LLM's dynamic adaptation process. Extensive experiments on nineteen T2I systems with varied safety mechanisms, three online commercial API services, and T2V models verify the superiority and practicality of our approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable ability to generate diverse and high-quality images by efficiently modeling complex data distributions. They have also been explored as powerful generative priors for signal recovery, resulting in a substantial improvement in the quality of reconstructed signals. However, existing research on signal recovery with diffusion models either focuses on specific reconstruction problems or is unable to handle nonlinear measurement models with discontinuous or unknown link functions. In this work, we focus on using DMs to achieve accurate recovery from semi-parametric single index models, which encompass a variety of popular nonlinear models that may have {\em discontinuous} and {\em unknown} link functions. We propose an efficient reconstruction method that only requires one round of unconditional sampling and (partial) inversion of DMs. Theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed methods has been established under appropriate conditions. We perform numerical experiments on image datasets for different nonlinear measurement models. We observe that compared to competing methods, our approach can yield more accurate reconstructions while utilizing significantly fewer neural function evaluations.

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8 Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++ achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

Abstract: Existing human motion generation methods with trajectory and pose inputs operate global processing on both modalities, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.

Typically, these annotations are merged into a single gold standard label, potentially losing valuable inter-rater variability. We propose a multi-annotator training approach for continuous emotion recognition (CER) that seeks a consensus across all annotators rather than relying on a single reference label. Our method employs a consensus network to aggregate annotations into a unified representation, guiding the main arousal-valence predictor to better reflect collective inputs. Tested on the RECOLA and COGNIMUSE datasets, our approach outperforms traditional methods that unify annotations into a single label. This underscores the benefits of fully leveraging multi-annotator data in emotion recognition and highlights its applicability across various fields where annotations are abundant yet inconsistent.

Abstract: Function fitting/approximation plays a fundamental role in computer graphics and other engineering applications. While recent advances have explored neural networks to address this task, these methods often rely on architectures with many parameters, limiting their practical applicability. In contrast, we pursue high-quality function approximation using parameter-efficient representations that eliminate the dependency on neural networks entirely. We first propose a novel framework for continuous function modeling. Most existing works can be formulated using this framework. We then introduce a compact function representation, which is based on polynomials interpolated using radial basis functions, bypassing both neural networks and complex/hierarchical data structures. We also develop memory-efficient CUDA-optimized algorithms that reduce computational time and memory consumption to less than 10% compared to conventional automatic differentiation frameworks. Finally, we validate our representation and optimization pipeline through extensive experiments on 3D signed distance functions (SDFs). The proposed representation achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art techniques (e.g., octree/hash-grid techniques) with significantly fewer parameters.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and an essential capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite the significant advancement in multimodal reasoning, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate their reasoning abilities due to the lack of explicit categorization for logical reasoning types and an unclear understanding of reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce MME-Reasoning, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of MLLMs, which covers all three types of reasoning (i.e., inductive, deductive, and abductive) in its questions. We carefully curate the data to ensure that each question effectively evaluates reasoning ability rather than perceptual skills or knowledge breadth, and extend the evaluation protocols to cover the evaluation of diverse questions. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations of state-of-the-art MLLMs when subjected to holistic assessments of logical reasoning capabilities. Even the most advanced MLLMs show limited performance in comprehensive logical reasoning, with notable performance imbalances across reasoning types. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of approaches such as ``thinking mode'' and Rule-based RL, which are commonly believed to enhance reasoning abilities. These findings highlight the critical limitations and performance imbalances of current MLLMs in diverse logical reasoning scenarios, providing comprehensive and systematic insights into the understanding and evaluation of reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have enabled the accurate estimation of 3D structures from multiview images. However, this capability is limited to estimating the visible external structure, and identifying the invisible internal structure hidden behind the surface is difficult. To overcome this limitation, we address a new task called Structure from Collision (SfC), which aims to estimate the structure (including the invisible internal structure) of an object from appearance changes during collision. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model called SfC-NeRF that optimizes the invisible internal structure of an object through a video sequence under physical, appearance (i.e., visible external structure)-preserving, and keyframe constraints. In particular, to avoid falling into undesirable local optima owing to its ill-posed nature, we propose volume annealing; that is, searching for global optima by repeatedly reducing and expanding the volume. Extensive experiments on 115 objects involving diverse structures (i.e., various cavity shapes, locations, and sizes) and material properties revealed the properties of SfC and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SfC-NeRF.

<title>Prostate Cancer Screening with Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Micro-Ultrasound: A Comparative Study with Traditional Methods</title>

Abstract: Background and objective: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a novel imaging modality with diagnostic accuracy comparable to MRI for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). We investigated whether artificial intelligence (AI) interpretation of micro-US can outperform clinical screening methods using PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE). Methods: We retrospectively studied 145 men who underwent micro-US guided biopsy (79 with csPCa, 66 without). A self-supervised convolutional autoencoder was used to extract deep image features from 2D micro-US slices. Random forest classifiers were trained using five-fold cross-validation to predict csPCa at the slice level. Patients were classified as csPCa-positive if 88 or more consecutive slices were predicted positive. Model performance was compared with a classifier using PSA, DRE, prostate volume, and age. Key findings and limitations: The AI-based micro-US model and clinical screening model achieved AUROCs of 0.871 and 0.753, respectively. At a fixed threshold, the micro-US model achieved 92.5% sensitivity and 68.1% specificity, while the clinical model showed 96.2% sensitivity but only 27.3% specificity. Limitations include a retrospective single-center design and lack of external validation. Conclusions and clinical implications: AI-interpreted micro-US improves specificity while maintaining high sensitivity for csPCa detection. This method may reduce unnecessary biopsies and serve as a low-cost alternative to PSA-based screening. Patient summary: We developed an AI system to analyze prostate micro-ultrasound images. It outperformed PSA and DRE in detecting aggressive cancer and may help avoid unnecessary biopsies.

<title>CoDA: Coordinated Diffusion Noise Optimization for Whole-Body Manipulation of Articulated Objects</title>

Abstract: Synthesizing whole-body manipulation of articulated objects, including body motion, hand motion, and object motion, is a critical yet challenging task with broad applications in virtual humans and robotics. The core challenges are twofold. First, achieving realistic whole-body motion requires tight coordination between the hands and the rest of the body, as their movements are interdependent during manipulation. Second, articulated object manipulation typically involves high degrees of freedom and demands higher precision, often requiring the fingers to be placed at specific regions to actuate movable parts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coordinated diffusion noise optimization framework. Specifically, we perform noise-space optimization over three specialized diffusion models for the body, left hand, and right hand, each trained on its own motion dataset to improve generalization. Coordination naturally emerges through gradient flow along the human kinematic chain, allowing the global body posture to adapt in response to hand motion objectives with high fidelity. To further enhance precision in hand-object interaction, we adopt a unified representation based on basis point sets (BPS), where end-effector positions are encoded as distances to the same BPS used for object geometry. This unified representation captures fine-grained spatial relationships between the hand and articulated object parts, and the resulting trajectories serve as targets to guide the optimization of diffusion noise, producing highly accurate interaction motion. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches in motion quality and physical plausibility, and enables various capabilities such as object pose control, simultaneous walking and manipulation, and whole-body generation from hand-only data.

Abstract: The performance of speaker verification systems is adversely affected by speaker aging. However, due to challenges in data collection, particularly the lack of sustained and large-scale longitudinal data for individuals, research on speaker aging remains difficult. In this paper, we present VoxAging, a large-scale longitudinal dataset collected from 293 speakers (226 English speakers and 67 Mandarin speakers) over several years, with the longest time span reaching 17 years (approximately 900 weeks). For each speaker, the data were recorded at weekly intervals. We studied the phenomenon of speaker aging and its effects on advanced speaker verification systems, analyzed individual speaker aging processes, and explored the impact of factors such as age group and gender on speaker aging research.

Abstract: Current video analytics approaches face a fundamental trade-off between flexibility and efficiency. End-to-end Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with long-context processing and incur high computational costs, while neural-symbolic methods depend heavily on manual labeling and rigid rule design. In this paper, we introduce LazyVLM, a neuro-symbolic video analytics system that provides a user-friendly query interface similar to VLMs, while addressing their scalability limitation. LazyVLM enables users to effortlessly drop in video data and specify complex multi-frame video queries using a semi-structured text interface for video analytics. To address the scalability limitations of VLMs, LazyVLM decomposes multi-frame video queries into fine-grained operations and offloads the bulk of the processing to efficient relational query execution and vector similarity search. We demonstrate that LazyVLM provides a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for querying open-domain video data at scale.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce UI-Genie, a self-improving framework addressing two key challenges in GUI agents: verification of trajectory outcome is challenging and high-quality training data are not scalable. These challenges are addressed by a reward model and a self-improving pipeline, respectively. The reward model, UI-Genie-RM, features an image-text interleaved architecture that efficiently pro- cesses historical context and unifies action-level and task-level rewards. To sup- port the training of UI-Genie-RM, we develop deliberately-designed data genera- tion strategies including rule-based verification, controlled trajectory corruption, and hard negative mining. To address the second challenge, a self-improvement pipeline progressively expands solvable complex GUI tasks by enhancing both the agent and reward models through reward-guided exploration and outcome verification in dynamic environments. For training the model, we generate UI- Genie-RM-517k and UI-Genie-Agent-16k, establishing the first reward-specific dataset for GUI agents while demonstrating high-quality synthetic trajectory gen- eration without manual annotation. Experimental results show that UI-Genie achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple GUI agent benchmarks with three generations of data-model self-improvement. We open-source our complete framework implementation and generated datasets to facilitate further research in https://github.com/Euphoria16/UI-Genie.

Abstract: Existing explanation tools for image classifiers usually give only a single explanation for an image's classification. For many images, however, image classifiers accept more than one explanation for the image label. These explanations are useful for analyzing the decision process of the classifier and for detecting errors. Thus, restricting the number of explanations to just one severely limits insight into the behavior of the classifier.
  In this paper, we describe an algorithm and a tool, MultEX, for computing multiple explanations as the output of a black-box image classifier for a given image. Our algorithm uses a principled approach based on actual causality. We analyze its theoretical complexity and evaluate MultEX against the state-of-the-art across three different models and three different datasets. We find that MultEX finds more explanations and that these explanations are of higher quality.

Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer the tantalizing prospect of unified information processing across visual and textual domains. But due to the lack of inherent inductive biases in ViTs, they require enormous amount of data for training. To make their applications practical, we introduce an innovative ensemble-based distillation approach distilling inductive bias from complementary lightweight teacher models. Prior systems relied solely on convolution-based teaching. However, this method incorporates an ensemble of light teachers with different architectural tendencies, such as convolution and involution, to instruct the student transformer jointly. Because of these unique inductive biases, instructors can accumulate a wide range of knowledge, even from readily identifiable stored datasets, which leads to enhanced student performance. Our proposed framework also involves precomputing and storing logits in advance, essentially the unnormalized predictions of the model. This optimization can accelerate the distillation process by eliminating the need for repeated forward passes during knowledge distillation, significantly reducing the computational burden and enhancing efficiency.

Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown encouraging results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing methods produce low-quality scene reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to their single, global radiance field with finite capacity, which does not adapt to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end, we introduce PLGSLAM, a neural visual SLAM system capable of high-fidelity surface reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real-time. To handle large-scale indoor scenes, PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation, PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency feature, achieving smoothness and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover, we propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in small and large-scale indoor environments). The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/dtc111111/plgslam.

Abstract: Existing 3D object detectors encounter extreme challenges in localizing unseen 3D objects and recognizing them as unseen, which is a crucial technology in autonomous driving in the wild. To address these challenges, we propose practical methods to enhance the performance of 3D detection and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) classification for unseen objects. The proposed methods include anomaly sample augmentation, learning of universal objectness, learning of detecting unseen objects, and learning of distinguishing unseen objects. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the KITTI Misc benchmark and two additional synthetic OOD benchmarks: the Nuscenes OOD benchmark and the SUN-RGBD OOD benchmark. The proposed methods consistently enhance performance by a large margin across all existing methods, giving insight for future work on unseen 3D object detection in the wild.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) 3D relighting requires novel view synthesis under unseen lighting conditions that differ significantly from the observed images. Existing relighting methods, which assume consistent light source distributions between training and testing, often degrade in OOD scenarios. We introduce MetaGS to tackle this challenge from two perspectives. First, we propose a meta-learning approach to train 3D Gaussian splatting, which explicitly promotes learning generalizable Gaussian geometries and appearance attributes across diverse lighting conditions, even with biased training data. Second, we embed fundamental physical priors from the Blinn-Phong reflection model into Gaussian splatting, which enhances the decoupling of shading components and leads to more accurate 3D scene reconstruction. Results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaGS in challenging OOD relighting tasks, supporting efficient point-light relighting and generalizing well to unseen environment lighting maps.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large vision pretrained models makes fine-tuning tasks more and more difficult on devices with low computational resources. We explore a new visual adaptation paradigm called separated tuning, which treats large pretrained models as standalone feature extractors that run on powerful cloud servers. The fine-tuning carries out on devices which possess only low computational resources (slow CPU, no GPU, small memory, etc.) Existing methods that are potentially suitable for our separated tuning paradigm are discussed. But, three major drawbacks hinder their application in separated tuning: low adaptation capability, large adapter network, and in particular, high information transfer overhead. To address these issues, we propose Minimal Interaction Separated Tuning, or MIST, which reveals that the sum of intermediate features from pretrained models not only has minimal information transfer but also has high adaptation capability. With a lightweight attention-based adaptor network, MIST achieves information transfer efficiency, parameter efficiency, computational and memory efficiency, and at the same time demonstrates competitive results on various visual adaptation benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased exceptional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning ability in complex textual inference tasks including causal reasoning. However, will these causalities remain straightforward when crucial hints hide in visual details? If not, what factors might influence cross-modal generalization? Whether we can effectively enhance their capacity for robust causal inference across both text and vision? Motivated by these, we introduce MuCR - a novel Multimodal Causal Reasoning benchmark that leverages synthetic siamese images and text pairs to challenge MLLMs. Additionally, we develop tailored metrics from multiple perspectives, including image-level match, phrase-level understanding, and sentence-level explanation, to comprehensively assess MLLMs' comprehension abilities. Our experiments reveal that current MLLMs fall short in multimodal causal reasoning compared to their performance in purely textual settings. Additionally, we find that identifying visual cues across images is key to effective cross-modal generalization. Finally, we propose a VcCoT strategy that better highlights visual cues, and our results confirm its efficacy in enhancing multimodal causal reasoning.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing utilizing generative diffusion models has garnered significant attention due to their potential applications. However, existing approaches are constrained by the limited word embeddings provided in pre-training, which hinders nuanced editing targeting open concepts with specific attributes. Directly altering the keywords in target prompts often results in unintended disruptions to the attention mechanisms. To achieve more flexible editing easily, this work proposes an improved concept-augmented video editing approach that generates diverse and stable target videos flexibly by devising abstract conceptual pairs. Specifically, the framework involves concept-augmented textual inversion and a dual prior supervision mechanism. The former enables plug-and-play guidance of stable diffusion for video editing, effectively capturing target attributes for more stylized results. The dual prior supervision mechanism significantly enhances video stability and fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach generates more stable and lifelike videos, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate spatial reasoning in outdoor environments - covering geometry, object pose, and inter-object relationships - is fundamental to downstream tasks such as mapping, motion forecasting, and high-level planning in autonomous driving. We introduce SURDS, a large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision language models (VLMs). Built on the nuScenes dataset, SURDS comprises 41,080 vision-question-answer training instances and 9,250 evaluation samples, spanning six spatial categories: orientation, depth estimation, pixel-level localization, pairwise distance, lateral ordering, and front-behind relations. We benchmark leading general-purpose VLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen, revealing persistent limitations in fine-grained spatial understanding. To address these deficiencies, we go beyond static evaluation and explore whether alignment techniques can improve spatial reasoning performance. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning-based alignment scheme leveraging spatially grounded reward signals - capturing both perception-level accuracy (location) and reasoning consistency (logic). We further incorporate final-answer correctness and output-format rewards to guide fine-grained policy adaptation. Our GRPO-aligned variant achieves an overall score of 40.80 in the SURDS benchmark. Notably, it outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o (13.30) and Gemini-2.0-flash (35.71). To our best knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that reinforcement learning-based alignment can significantly and consistently enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in real-world driving contexts. We release the SURDS benchmark, evaluation toolkit, and GRPO alignment code through: https://github.com/XiandaGuo/Drive-MLLM.

Abstract: This paper explores the Class-Incremental Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-SFUDA) problem, where the unlabeled target data come incrementally without access to labeled source instances. This problem poses two challenges, the interference of similar source-class knowledge in target-class representation learning and the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. To address them, we propose the Multi-Granularity Class Prototype Topology Distillation (GROTO) algorithm, which effectively transfers the source knowledge to the class-incremental target domain. Concretely, we design the multi-granularity class prototype self-organization module and the prototype topology distillation module. First, we mine the positive classes by modeling accumulation distributions. Next, we introduce multi-granularity class prototypes to generate reliable pseudo-labels, and exploit them to promote the positive-class target feature self-organization. Second, the positive-class prototypes are leveraged to construct the topological structures of source and target feature spaces. Then, we perform the topology distillation to continually mitigate the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/dengpeihua/GROTO.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled the creation of dynamic 4D content - 3D objects in motion - based on text prompts, which holds potential for applications in virtual worlds, media, and gaming. Existing methods provide control over the appearance of generated content, including the ability to animate 3D objects. However, their ability to generate dynamics is limited to the mesh datasets they were trained on, lacking any growth or structural development capability. In this work, we introduce a training-free method for animating 3D objects by conditioning on textual prompts to guide 4D generation, enabling custom general scenes while maintaining the original object's identity. We first convert a 3D mesh into a static 4D Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that preserves the object's visual attributes. Then, we animate the object using an Image-to-Video diffusion model driven by text. To improve motion realism, we introduce a view-consistent noising protocol that aligns object perspectives with the noising process to promote lifelike movement, and a masked Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss that leverages attention maps to focus optimization on relevant regions, better preserving the original object. We evaluate our model on two different 3D object datasets for temporal coherence, prompt adherence, and visual fidelity, and find that our method outperforms the baseline based on multiview training, achieving better consistency with the textual prompt in hard scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce intra-class memorability, where certain images within the same class are more memorable than others despite shared category characteristics. To investigate what features make one object instance more memorable than others, we design and conduct human behavior experiments, where participants are shown a series of images, and they must identify when the current image matches the image presented a few steps back in the sequence. To quantify memorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel metric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image presentations into its calculation. Furthermore, we curate the Intra-Class Memorability Dataset (ICMD), comprising over 5,000 images across ten object classes with their ICMscores derived from 2,000 participants' responses. Subsequently, we demonstrate the usefulness of ICMD by training AI models on this dataset for various downstream tasks: memorability prediction, image recognition, continual learning, and memorability-controlled image editing. Surprisingly, high-ICMscore images impair AI performance in image recognition and continual learning tasks, while low-ICMscore images improve outcomes in these tasks. Additionally, we fine-tune a state-of-the-art image diffusion model on ICMD image pairs with and without masked semantic objects. The diffusion model can successfully manipulate image elements to enhance or reduce memorability. Our contributions open new pathways in understanding intra-class memorability by scrutinizing fine-grained visual features behind the most and least memorable images and laying the groundwork for real-world applications in computer vision. We will release all code, data, and models publicly.

Abstract: With advances in diffusion models, image generation has shown significant performance improvements. This raises concerns about the potential abuse of image generation, such as the creation of explicit or violent images, commonly referred to as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. To address this, the Stable Diffusion model includes several safety checkers to censor initial text prompts and final output images generated from the model. However, recent research has shown that these safety checkers have vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks, allowing them to generate NSFW images. In this paper, we find that these adversarial attacks are not robust to small changes in text prompts or input latents. Based on this, we propose SC-Pro (Spherical or Circular Probing), a training-free framework that easily defends against adversarial attacks generating NSFW images. Moreover, we develop an approach that utilizes one-step diffusion models for efficient NSFW detection (SC-Pro-o), further reducing computational resources. We demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of performance and applicability.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for high-fidelity reconstruction of pelvic structures by integrating medical image segmentation and point cloud upsampling. By point cloud upsampling to learn shape priors from MedShapePelvic without requiring landmarks or PCA, our method functions as an implicit statistical shape model. Evaluations on Pelvic1k show significant improvements in surface quality and anatomical accuracy. This approach is generalizable and applicable to other skeletal regions.

<title>DADM: Dual Alignment of Domain and Modality for Face Anti-spoofing</title>

Abstract: With the availability of diverse sensor modalities (i.e., RGB, Depth, Infrared) and the success of multi-modal learning, multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) has emerged as a prominent research focus. The intuition behind it is that leveraging multiple modalities can uncover more intrinsic spoofing traces. However, this approach presents more risk of misalignment. We identify two main types of misalignment: (1) \textbf{Intra-domain modality misalignment}, where the importance of each modality varies across different attacks. For instance, certain modalities (e.g., Depth) may be non-defensive against specific attacks (e.g., 3D mask), indicating that each modality has unique strengths and weaknesses in countering particular attacks. Consequently, simple fusion strategies may fall short. (2) \textbf{Inter-domain modality misalignment}, where the introduction of additional modalities exacerbates domain shifts, potentially overshadowing the benefits of complementary fusion. To tackle (1), we propose a alignment module between modalities based on mutual information, which adaptively enhances favorable modalities while suppressing unfavorable ones. To address (2), we employ a dual alignment optimization method that aligns both sub-domain hyperplanes and modality angle margins, thereby mitigating domain gaps. Our method, dubbed \textbf{D}ual \textbf{A}lignment of \textbf{D}omain and \textbf{M}odality (DADM), achieves state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments across four challenging protocols demonstrating its robustness in multi-modal domain generalization scenarios. The codes will be released soon.

Abstract: In the age of increasingly realistic generative AI, robust deepfake detection is essential for mitigating fraud and disinformation. While many deepfake detectors report high accuracy on academic datasets, we show that these academic benchmarks are out of date and not representative of real-world deepfakes. We introduce Deepfake-Eval-2024, a new deepfake detection benchmark consisting of in-the-wild deepfakes collected from social media and deepfake detection platform users in 2024. Deepfake-Eval-2024 consists of 45 hours of videos, 56.5 hours of audio, and 1,975 images, encompassing the latest manipulation technologies. The benchmark contains diverse media content from 88 different websites in 52 different languages. We find that the performance of open-source state-of-the-art deepfake detection models drops precipitously when evaluated on Deepfake-Eval-2024, with AUC decreasing by 50% for video, 48% for audio, and 45% for image models compared to previous benchmarks. We also evaluate commercial deepfake detection models and models finetuned on Deepfake-Eval-2024, and find that they have superior performance to off-the-shelf open-source models, but do not yet reach the accuracy of deepfake forensic analysts. The dataset is available at https://github.com/nuriachandra/Deepfake-Eval-2024.

<title>How Do Multimodal Large Language Models Handle Complex Multimodal Reasoning? Placing Them in An Extensible Escape Game</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10042</link>

Abstract: The rapid advancing of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in complex multimodal reasoning tasks in the real-world and virtual environment, which require coordinating multiple abilities, including visual perception, visual reasoning, spatial awareness, and target deduction. However, existing evaluations primarily assess the final task completion, often degrading assessments to isolated abilities such as visual grounding and visual question answering. Less attention is given to comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing reasoning process in multimodal environments, which is crucial for understanding model behaviors and underlying reasoning mechanisms beyond merely task success. To address this, we introduce MM-Escape, an extensible benchmark for investigating multimodal reasoning, inspired by real-world escape games. MM-Escape emphasizes intermediate model behaviors alongside final task completion. To achieve this, we develop EscapeCraft, a customizable and open environment that enables models to engage in free-form exploration for assessing multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments show that MLLMs, regardless of scale, can successfully complete the simplest room escape tasks, with some exhibiting human-like exploration strategies. Yet, performance dramatically drops as task difficulty increases. Moreover, we observe that performance bottlenecks vary across models, revealing distinct failure modes and limitations in their multimodal reasoning abilities, such as repetitive trajectories without adaptive exploration, getting stuck in corners due to poor visual spatial awareness, and ineffective use of acquired props, such as the key. We hope our work sheds light on new challenges in multimodal reasoning, and uncovers potential improvements in MLLMs capabilities.

<title>Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking</title>

Abstract: As a significant application of multi-source information fusion in intelligent transportation perception systems, Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) involves localizing and tracking specific objects in video sequences based on language references. However, existing RMOT approaches often treat language descriptions as holistic embeddings and struggle to effectively integrate the rich semantic information contained in language expressions with visual features. This limitation is especially apparent in complex scenes requiring comprehensive understanding of both static object attributes and spatial motion information. In this paper, we propose a Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CDRMT) framework that addresses these challenges. It adapts the "what" and "where" pathways from the human visual processing system to RMOT tasks. Specifically, our framework first establishes cross-modal connections while preserving modality-specific characteristics. It then disentangles language descriptions and hierarchically injects them into object queries, refining object understanding from coarse to fine-grained semantic levels. Finally, we reconstruct language representations based on visual features, ensuring that tracked objects faithfully reflect the referring expression. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDRMT achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 6.0% in HOTA score on Refer-KITTI and 3.2% on Refer-KITTI-V2. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art in RMOT while simultaneously providing new insights into multi-source information fusion.

Abstract: Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model's bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.

<title>One-Step Residual Shifting Diffusion for Image Super-Resolution via Distillation</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models for super-resolution (SR) produce high-quality visual results but require expensive computational costs. Despite the development of several methods to accelerate diffusion-based SR models, some (e.g., SinSR) fail to produce realistic perceptual details, while others (e.g., OSEDiff) may hallucinate non-existent structures. To overcome these issues, we present RSD, a new distillation method for ResShift, one of the top diffusion-based SR models. Our method is based on training the student network to produce such images that a new fake ResShift model trained on them will coincide with the teacher model. RSD achieves single-step restoration and outperforms the teacher by a large margin. We show that our distillation method can surpass the other distillation-based method for ResShift - SinSR - making it on par with state-of-the-art diffusion-based SR distillation methods. Compared to SR methods based on pre-trained text-to-image models, RSD produces competitive perceptual quality, provides images with better alignment to degraded input images, and requires fewer parameters and GPU memory. We provide experimental results on various real-world and synthetic datasets, including RealSR, RealSet65, DRealSR, ImageNet, and DIV2K.

Abstract: Person detection methods are used widely in applications including visual surveillance, pedestrian detection, and robotics. However, accurate detection of persons from overhead fisheye images remains an open challenge because of factors including person rotation and small-sized persons. To address the person rotation problem, we convert the fisheye images into panoramic images. For smaller people, we focused on the geometry of the panoramas. Conventional detection methods tend to focus on larger people because these larger people yield large significant areas for feature maps. In equirectangular panoramic images, we find that a person's height decreases linearly near the top of the images. Using this finding, we leverage the significance values and aggregate tokens that are sorted based on these values to balance the significant areas. In this leveraging process, we introduce panoramic distortion-aware tokenization. This tokenization procedure divides a panoramic image using self-similarity figures that enable determination of optimal divisions without gaps, and we leverage the maximum significant values in each tile of token groups to preserve the significant areas of smaller people. To achieve higher detection accuracy, we propose a person detection and localization method that combines panoramic-image remapping and the tokenization procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms conventional methods when applied to large-scale datasets.

<title>Exploring Disentangled and Controllable Human Image Synthesis: From End-to-End to Stage-by-Stage</title>

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained controllability in human image synthesis is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. Existing methods primarily focus on either facial synthesis or near-frontal body generation, with limited ability to simultaneously control key factors such as viewpoint, pose, clothing, and identity in a disentangled manner. In this paper, we introduce a new disentangled and controllable human synthesis task, which explicitly separates and manipulates these four factors within a unified framework. We first develop an end-to-end generative model trained on MVHumanNet for factor disentanglement. However, the domain gap between MVHumanNet and in-the-wild data produces unsatisfactory results, motivating the exploration of virtual try-on (VTON) dataset as a potential solution. Through experiments, we observe that simply incorporating the VTON dataset as additional data to train the end-to-end model degrades performance, primarily due to the inconsistency in data forms between the two datasets, which disrupts the disentanglement process. To better leverage both datasets, we propose a stage-by-stage framework that decomposes human image generation into three sequential steps: clothed A-pose generation, back-view synthesis, and pose and view control. This structured pipeline enables better dataset utilization at different stages, significantly improving controllability and generalization, especially for in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our stage-by-stage approach outperforms end-to-end models in both visual fidelity and disentanglement quality, offering a scalable solution for real-world tasks. Additional demos are available on the project page: https://taited.github.io/discohuman-project/.

Abstract: With the rapid development of multimodal models, the demand for assessing video understanding capabilities has been steadily increasing. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating video understanding exhibit significant limitations in coverage, task diversity, and scene adaptability. These shortcomings hinder the accurate assessment of models' comprehensive video understanding capabilities. To tackle this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and holistic video understanding (H2VU) benchmark designed to evaluate both general video and online streaming video comprehension. This benchmark contributes three key features:
  Extended video duration: Spanning videos from brief 3-second clips to comprehensive 1.5-hour recordings, thereby bridging the temporal gaps found in current benchmarks. Comprehensive assessment tasks: Beyond traditional perceptual and reasoning tasks, we have introduced modules for countercommonsense comprehension and trajectory state tracking. These additions test the models' deep understanding capabilities beyond mere prior knowledge. Enriched video data: To keep pace with the rapid evolution of current AI agents, we have expanded first-person streaming video datasets. This expansion allows for the exploration of multimodal models' performance in understanding streaming videos from a first-person perspective. Extensive results from H2VU reveal that existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) possess substantial potential for improvement in our newly proposed evaluation tasks. We expect that H2VU will facilitate advancements in video understanding research by offering a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of MLLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model on a tailored portrait dataset is the mainstream method for text-to-portrait customization. However, existing methods often severely impact the original model's behavior (e.g., changes in ID, layout, etc.) while customizing portrait attributes. To address this issue, we propose SPF-Portrait, a pioneering work to purely understand customized target semantics and minimize disruption to the original model. In our SPF-Portrait, we design a dual-path contrastive learning pipeline, which introduces the original model as a behavioral alignment reference for the conventional fine-tuning path. During the contrastive learning, we propose a novel Semantic-Aware Fine Control Map that indicates the intensity of response regions of the target semantics, to spatially guide the alignment process between the contrastive paths. It adaptively balances the behavioral alignment across different regions and the responsiveness of the target semantics. Furthermore, we propose a novel response enhancement mechanism to reinforce the presentation of target semantics, while mitigating representation discrepancy inherent in direct cross-modal supervision. Through the above strategies, we achieve incremental learning of customized target semantics for pure text-to-portrait customization. Extensive experiments show that SPF-Portrait achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://spf-portrait.github.io/SPF-Portrait/

Abstract: Multimodal medical images play a crucial role in the precise and comprehensive clinical diagnosis. Diffusion model is a powerful strategy to synthesize the required medical images. However, existing approaches still suffer from the problem of anatomical structure distortion due to the overfitting of high-frequency information and the weakening of low-frequency information. Thus, we propose a novel method based on dynamic frequency balance and knowledge guidance. Specifically, we first extract the low-frequency and high-frequency components by decomposing the critical features of the model using wavelet transform. Then, a dynamic frequency balance module is designed to adaptively adjust frequency for enhancing global low-frequency features and effective high-frequency details as well as suppressing high-frequency noise. To further overcome the challenges posed by the large differences between different medical modalities, we construct a knowledge-guided mechanism that fuses the prior clinical knowledge from a visual language model with visual features, to facilitate the generation of accurate anatomical structures. Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets show the proposed method achieves significant improvements in qualitative and quantitative assessments, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: We introduce TAPIP3D, a novel approach for long-term 3D point tracking in monocular RGB and RGB-D videos. TAPIP3D represents videos as camera-stabilized spatio-temporal feature clouds, leveraging depth and camera motion information to lift 2D video features into a 3D world space where camera movement is effectively canceled out. Within this stabilized 3D representation, TAPIP3D iteratively refines multi-frame motion estimates, enabling robust point tracking over long time horizons. To handle the irregular structure of 3D point distributions, we propose a 3D Neighborhood-to-Neighborhood (N2N) attention mechanism - a 3D-aware contextualization strategy that builds informative, spatially coherent feature neighborhoods to support precise trajectory estimation. Our 3D-centric formulation significantly improves performance over existing 3D point tracking methods and even surpasses state-of-the-art 2D pixel trackers in accuracy when reliable depth is available. The model supports inference in both camera-centric (unstabilized) and world-centric (stabilized) coordinates, with experiments showing that compensating for camera motion leads to substantial gains in tracking robustness. By replacing the conventional 2D square correlation windows used in prior 2D and 3D trackers with a spatially grounded 3D attention mechanism, TAPIP3D achieves strong and consistent results across multiple 3D point tracking benchmarks.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning for point cloud has demonstrated effectiveness in improving pre-trained model performance across diverse tasks. However, as pre-trained models grow in complexity, fully fine-tuning them for downstream applications demands substantial computational and storage resources. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer a promising solution to mitigate these resource requirements, yet most current approaches rely on complex adapter and prompt mechanisms that increase tunable parameters. In this paper, we propose PointLoRA, a simple yet effective method that combines low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with multi-scale token selection to efficiently fine-tune point cloud models. Our approach embeds LoRA layers within the most parameter-intensive components of point cloud transformers, reducing the need for tunable parameters while enhancing global feature capture. Additionally, multi-scale token selection extracts critical local information to serve as prompts for downstream fine-tuning, effectively complementing the global context captured by LoRA. The experimental results across various pre-trained models and three challenging public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance with only 3.43% of the trainable parameters, making it highly effective for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Garment sewing patterns are fundamental design elements that bridge the gap between design concepts and practical manufacturing. The generative modeling of sewing patterns is crucial for creating diversified garments. However, existing approaches are limited either by reliance on a single input modality or by suboptimal generation efficiency. In this work, we present GarmentDiffusion, a new generative model capable of producing centimeter-precise, vectorized 3D sewing patterns from multimodal inputs (text, image, and incomplete sewing pattern). Our method efficiently encodes 3D sewing pattern parameters into compact edge token representations, achieving a sequence length that is 10 times shorter than that of the autoregressive SewingGPT in DressCode. By employing a diffusion transformer, we simultaneously denoise all edge tokens along the temporal axis, while maintaining a constant number of denoising steps regardless of dataset-specific edge and panel statistics. With all combination of designs of our model, the sewing pattern generation speed is accelerated by 100 times compared to SewingGPT. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on DressCodeData, as well as on the largest sewing pattern dataset, namely GarmentCodeData.

Abstract: Event cameras excel in high-speed vision due to their high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. However, as dynamic vision sensors, their output is inherently noisy, making efficient denoising essential to preserve their ultra-low latency and real-time processing capabilities. Existing event denoising methods struggle with a critical dilemma: computationally intensive approaches compromise the sensor's high-speed advantage, while lightweight methods often lack robustness across varying noise levels. To address this, we propose a novel event denoising framework based on State Space Models (SSMs). Our approach represents events as 4D event clouds and includes a Coarse Feature Extraction (CFE) module that extracts embedding features from both geometric and polarity-aware subspaces. The model is further composed of two essential components: A Spatial Mamba (S-SSM) that models local geometric structures and a Temporal Mamba (T-SSM) that captures global temporal dynamics, efficiently propagating spatiotemporal features across events. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency, with 88.89K parameters, 0.0685s per 100K events inference time, and a 0.982 accuracy score, outperforming Transformer-based methods by 2.08% in denoising accuracy and 36X faster.

Abstract: We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer (Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM. Project Page: https://selftok-team.github.io/report/.

Abstract: Reflectance attributes in LiDAR point clouds provide essential information for downstream tasks but remain underexplored in neural compression methods. To address this, we introduce SerLiC, a serialization-based neural compression framework to fully exploit the intrinsic characteristics of LiDAR reflectance. SerLiC first transforms 3D LiDAR point clouds into 1D sequences via scan-order serialization, offering a device-centric perspective for reflectance analysis. Each point is then tokenized into a contextual representation comprising its sensor scanning index, radial distance, and prior reflectance, for effective dependencies exploration. For efficient sequential modeling, Mamba is incorporated with a dual parallelization scheme, enabling simultaneous autoregressive dependency capture and fast processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SerLiC attains over 2x volume reduction against the original reflectance data, outperforming the state-of-the-art method by up to 22% reduction of compressed bits while using only 2% of its parameters. Moreover, a lightweight version of SerLiC achieves > 10 fps (frames per second) with just 111K parameters, which is attractive for real-world applications.

Abstract: The rapid extension of context windows in large vision-language models has given rise to long-context vision-language models (LCVLMs), which are capable of handling hundreds of images with interleaved text tokens in a single forward pass. In this work, we introduce MMLongBench, the first benchmark covering a diverse set of long-context vision-language tasks, to evaluate LCVLMs effectively and thoroughly. MMLongBench is composed of 13,331 examples spanning five different categories of downstream tasks, such as Visual RAG and Many-Shot ICL. It also provides broad coverage of image types, including various natural and synthetic images. To assess the robustness of the models to different input lengths, all examples are delivered at five standardized input lengths (8K-128K tokens) via a cross-modal tokenization scheme that combines vision patches and text tokens. Through a thorough benchmarking of 46 closed-source and open-source LCVLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current models' vision-language long-context ability. Our results show that: i) performance on a single task is a weak proxy for overall long-context capability; ii) both closed-source and open-source models face challenges in long-context vision-language tasks, indicating substantial room for future improvement; iii) models with stronger reasoning ability tend to exhibit better long-context performance. By offering wide task coverage, various image types, and rigorous length control, MMLongBench provides the missing foundation for diagnosing and advancing the next generation of LCVLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced capabilities in Document Understanding. However, prevailing benchmarks like DocVQA and ChartQA predominantly comprise \textit{scanned or digital} documents, inadequately reflecting the intricate challenges posed by diverse real-world scenarios, such as variable illumination and physical distortions. This paper introduces WildDoc, the inaugural benchmark designed specifically for assessing document understanding in natural environments. WildDoc incorporates a diverse set of manually captured document images reflecting real-world conditions and leverages document sources from established benchmarks to facilitate comprehensive comparisons with digital or scanned documents. Further, to rigorously evaluate model robustness, each document is captured four times under different conditions. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildDoc expose substantial performance declines and underscore the models' inadequate robustness compared to traditional benchmarks, highlighting the unique challenges posed by real-world document understanding.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning is the predominant method for Whole Slide Image classification in digital pathology, enabling the use of slide-level labels to supervise model training. Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag- and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue, instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions. Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed methods.

<title>SoftPQ: Robust Instance Segmentation Evaluation via Soft Matching and Tunable Thresholds</title>

Abstract: Segmentation evaluation metrics traditionally rely on binary decision logic: predictions are either correct or incorrect, based on rigid IoU thresholds. Detection--based metrics such as F1 and mAP determine correctness at the object level using fixed overlap cutoffs, while overlap--based metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice operate at the pixel level, often overlooking instance--level structure. Panoptic Quality (PQ) attempts to unify detection and segmentation assessment, but it remains dependent on hard-threshold matching--treating predictions below the threshold as entirely incorrect. This binary framing obscures important distinctions between qualitatively different errors and fails to reward gradual model improvements. We propose SoftPQ, a flexible and interpretable instance segmentation metric that redefines evaluation as a graded continuum rather than a binary classification. SoftPQ introduces tunable upper and lower IoU thresholds to define a partial matching region and applies a sublinear penalty function to ambiguous or fragmented predictions. These extensions allow SoftPQ to exhibit smoother score behavior, greater robustness to structural segmentation errors, and more informative feedback for model development and evaluation. Through controlled perturbation experiments, we show that SoftPQ captures meaningful differences in segmentation quality that existing metrics overlook, making it a practical and principled alternative for both benchmarking and iterative model refinement.

Abstract: Video-based spatial cognition is vital for robotics and embodied AI but challenges current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2 (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial reasoning. ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset to facilitate further research.

<title>Rebalancing Contrastive Alignment with Learnable Semantic Gaps in Text-Video Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-video retrieval have been largely driven by contrastive learning frameworks. However, existing methods overlook a key source of optimization tension: the separation between text and video distributions in the representation space (referred to as the modality gap), and the prevalence of false negatives in batch sampling. These factors lead to conflicting gradients under the InfoNCE loss, impeding stable alignment. To mitigate this, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces a learnable, pair-specific increment Delta_ij between text t_i and video v_j to offload the tension from the global anchor representation. We first derive the ideal form of Delta_ij via a coupled multivariate first-order Taylor approximation of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, revealing it as a mechanism for resolving gradient conflicts by guiding updates along a locally optimal descent direction. Due to the high cost of directly computing Delta_ij, we introduce a lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic gap between each video-text pair, enabling structure-aware correction guided by gradient supervision. To further stabilize learning and promote interpretability, we regularize Delta using three components: a trust-region constraint to prevent oscillation, a directional diversity term to promote semantic coverage, and an information bottleneck to limit redundancy. Experiments across four retrieval benchmarks show that GARE consistently improves alignment accuracy and robustness to noisy supervision, confirming the effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.

Abstract: Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues. To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets: DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased detectors.

Abstract: A face morph is created by combining two (or more) face images corresponding to two (or more) identities to produce a composite that successfully matches the constituent identities. Reference-free (RF) demorphing reverses this process using only the morph image, without the need for additional reference images. Previous RF demorphing methods were overly constrained, as they rely on assumptions about the distributions of training and testing morphs such as the morphing technique used, face style, and images used to create the morph. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach that effectively disentangles component images from a composite morph image with high visual fidelity. Our method is the first to generalize across morph techniques and face styles, beating the current state of the art by $\geq 59.46\%$ under a common training protocol across all datasets tested. We train our method on morphs created using synthetically generated face images and test on real morphs, thereby enhancing the practicality of the technique. Experiments on six datasets and two face matchers establish the utility and efficacy of our method.

Abstract: Building machines that can reason about physical events and their causal relationships is crucial for flexible interaction with the physical world. However, most existing physical and causal reasoning benchmarks are exclusively based on synthetically generated events and synthetic natural language descriptions of causal relationships. This design brings up two issues. First, there is a lack of diversity in both event types and natural language descriptions; second, causal relationships based on manually-defined heuristics are different from human judgments. To address both shortcomings, we present the CLEVRER-Humans benchmark, a video reasoning dataset for causal judgment of physical events with human labels. We employ two techniques to improve data collection efficiency: first, a novel iterative event cloze task to elicit a new representation of events in videos, which we term Causal Event Graphs (CEGs); second, a data augmentation technique based on neural language generative models. We convert the collected CEGs into questions and answers to be consistent with prior work. Finally, we study a collection of baseline approaches for CLEVRER-Humans question-answering, highlighting the great challenges set forth by our benchmark.

Abstract: Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is a growing need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings. This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer semantic questions about the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to "imagine" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description of the local curvatures and strokes. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning systems. In recent years, it has received increasing attention, particularly through post-hoc detection and training-based methods. In this paper, we focus on post-hoc OOD detection, which enables identifying OOD samples without altering the model's training procedure or objective. Our primary goal is to investigate the relationship between model capacity and its OOD detection performance. Specifically, we aim to answer the following question: Does the Double Descent phenomenon manifest in post-hoc OOD detection? This question is crucial, as it can reveal whether overparameterization, which is already known to benefit generalization, can also enhance OOD detection. Despite the growing interest in these topics by the classic supervised machine learning community, this intersection remains unexplored for OOD detection. We empirically demonstrate that the Double Descent effect does indeed appear in post-hoc OOD detection. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights to explain why this phenomenon emerges in such setting. Finally, we show that the overparameterized regime does not yield superior results consistently, and we propose a method to identify the optimal regime for OOD detection based on our observations.

Abstract: Recent works demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion models as unsupervised solvers for inverse imaging problems. Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) has greatly benefited from these advancements, achieving improved generalization without reliance on measurement parameters. However, this comes at the cost of potential hallucinations, especially when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To ensure reliability, it is essential to study OOD detection for CT reconstruction across both clinical and industrial applications. This need further extends to enabling the OOD detector to function effectively as an anomaly inspection tool. In this paper, we explore the use of a diffusion model, trained to capture the target distribution for CT reconstruction, as an in-distribution prior. Building on recent research, we employ the model to reconstruct partially diffused input images and assess OOD-ness through multiple reconstruction errors. Adapting this approach for sparse-view CT requires redefining the notions of ``input'' and ``reconstruction error''. Here, we use filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstructions as input and investigate various definitions of reconstruction error. Our proof-of-concept experiments on the MNIST dataset highlight both successes and failures, demonstrating the potential and limitations of integrating such an OOD detector into a CT reconstruction system. Our findings suggest that effective OOD detection can be achieved by comparing measurements with forward-projected reconstructions, provided that reconstructions from noisy FBP inputs are conditioned on the measurements. However, conditioning can sometimes lead the OOD detector to inadvertently reconstruct OOD images well. To counter this, we introduce a weighting approach that improves robustness against highly informative OOD measurements, albeit with a trade-off in performance in certain cases.

Abstract: The integration of algorithms from quantum information with neural networks has enabled unprecedented advancements in various domains. Nonetheless, the application of quantum machine learning algorithms for image classification predominantly relies on traditional architectures such as variational quantum circuits. The performance of these models is closely tied to the scale of their parameters, with the substantial demand for parameters potentially leading to limitations in computational resources and a significant increase in computation time. In this paper, we introduce a Lean Classical-Quantum Hybrid Neural Network (LCQHNN), which achieves efficient classification performance with only four layers of variational circuits, thereby substantially reducing computational costs. Our experiments demonstrate that LCQHNN achieves 100\%, 99.02\%, and 85.55\% classification accuracy on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Under the same parameter conditions, the convergence speed of this method is also faster than that of traditional models. Furthermore, through visualization studies, it is found that the model effectively captures key data features during training and establishes a clear association between these features and their corresponding categories. This study confirms that the employment of quantum algorithms enhances the model's ability to handle complex classification problems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the inherent inference latency challenges associated with deploying multimodal large language models (MLLM) in quadruped vision-language-action (QUAR-VLA) tasks. Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%.

Abstract: Ultrasound-based bone surface segmentation is crucial in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. However, ultrasound images have limitations, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, and acoustic shadowing, which make interpretation difficult. Existing deep learning models for bone segmentation rely primarily on costly manual labeling by experts, limiting dataset size and model generalizability. Additionally, the complexity of ultrasound physics and acoustic shadow makes the images difficult for humans to interpret, leading to incomplete labels in anechoic regions and limiting model performance. To advance ultrasound bone segmentation and establish effective model benchmarks, larger and higher-quality datasets are needed.
  We propose a methodology for collecting ex-vivo ultrasound datasets with automatically generated bone labels, including anechoic regions. The proposed labels are derived by accurately superimposing tracked bone CT models onto the tracked ultrasound images. These initial labels are refined to account for ultrasound physics. A clinical evaluation is conducted by an expert physician specialized on orthopedic sonography to assess the quality of the generated bone labels. A neural network for bone segmentation is trained on the collected dataset and its predictions are compared to expert manual labels, evaluating accuracy, completeness, and F1-score.
  We collected the largest known dataset of 100k ultrasound images of human lower limbs with bone labels, called UltraBones100k. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction confirmed that the bone alignment after our method significantly improved the quality of bone labeling (p < 0.001).

Abstract: Recent advances in training one-step diffusion models typically follow a two-stage pipeline: first training a teacher diffusion model and then distilling it into a one-step student model. This process often depends on both the teacher's score function for supervision and its weights for initializing the student model. In this paper, we explore whether one-step diffusion models can be trained directly without this distillation procedure. We introduce a family of new training methods that entirely forgo teacher score supervision, yet outperforms most teacher-guided distillation approaches. This suggests that score supervision is not essential for effective training of one-step diffusion models. However, we find that initializing the student model with the teacher's weights remains critical. Surprisingly, the key advantage of teacher initialization is not due to better latent-to-output mappings, but rather the rich set of feature representations across different noise levels that the teacher diffusion model provides. These insights take us one step closer towards training one-step diffusion models without distillation and provide a better understanding of the roles of teacher supervision and initialization in the distillation process.

Abstract: The properties of black holes and accretion flows can be inferred by fitting Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data to simulated images generated through general relativistic ray tracing (GRRT). However, due to the computationally intensive nature of GRRT, the efficiency of generating specific radiation flux images needs to be improved. This paper introduces the Branch Correction Denoising Diffusion Model (BCDDM), a deep learning framework that synthesizes black hole images directly from physical parameters. The model incorporates a branch correction mechanism and a weighted mixed loss function to enhance accuracy and stability. We have constructed a dataset of 2,157 GRRT-simulated images for training the BCDDM, which spans seven key physical parameters of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the generated images and their physical parameters. By enhancing the GRRT dataset with BCDDM-generated images and using ResNet50 for parameter regression, we achieve significant improvements in parameter prediction performance. BCDDM offers a novel approach to reducing the computational costs of black hole image generation, providing a faster and more efficient pathway for dataset augmentation, parameter estimation, and model fitting.

Abstract: Classical machine learning often struggles with complex, high-dimensional data. Quantum machine learning offers a potential solution, promising more efficient processing. The quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), a hybrid algorithm, fits current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. However, its training depends largely on classical computation. Future gate-based quantum computers may realize full quantum advantages. In contrast to QCNNs, quantum autoencoders (QAEs) leverage classical optimization solely for parameter tuning. Data compression and reconstruction are handled entirely within quantum circuits, enabling purely quantum-based feature extraction. This study introduces a novel image-classification approach using QAEs, achieving classification without requiring additional qubits compared with conventional QAE implementations. The quantum circuit structure significantly impacts classification accuracy. Unlike hybrid methods such as QCNN, QAE-based classification emphasizes quantum computation. Our experiments demonstrate high accuracy in a four-class classification task, evaluating various quantum-gate configurations to understand the impact of different parameterized quantum circuit structures on classification performance. Specifically, noise-free conditions are considered, and simulations are performed using a statevector simulator to model the quantum system with full amplitude precision. Our results reveal that specific ansatz structures achieve superior accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of conventional machine-learning methods while significantly reducing the number of parameters requiring optimization. These findings indicate that QAEs can serve as efficient classification models with fewer parameters and highlight the potential of utilizing quantum circuits for complete end-to-end learning.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) systems often focus on either discrete (panoramic) or continuous (free-motion) paradigms alone, overlooking the complexities of human-populated, dynamic environments. We introduce a unified Human-Aware VLN (HA-VLN) benchmark that merges these paradigms under explicit social-awareness constraints. Our contributions include: 1. A standardized task definition that balances discrete-continuous navigation with personal-space requirements; 2. An enhanced human motion dataset (HAPS 2.0) and upgraded simulators capturing realistic multi-human interactions, outdoor contexts, and refined motion-language alignment; 3. Extensive benchmarking on 16,844 human-centric instructions, revealing how multi-human dynamics and partial observability pose substantial challenges for leading VLN agents; 4. Real-world robot tests validating sim-to-real transfer in crowded indoor spaces; and 5. A public leaderboard supporting transparent comparisons across discrete and continuous tasks. Empirical results show improved navigation success and fewer collisions when social context is integrated, underscoring the need for human-centric design. By releasing all datasets, simulators, agent code, and evaluation tools, we aim to advance safer, more capable, and socially responsible VLN research.

Abstract: Current robotic planning methods often rely on predicting multi-frame images with full pixel details. While this fine-grained approach can serve as a generic world model, it introduces two significant challenges for downstream policy learning: substantial computational costs that hinder real-time deployment, and accumulated inaccuracies that can mislead action extraction. Planning with coarse-grained subgoals partially alleviates efficiency issues. However, their forward planning schemes can still result in off-task predictions due to accumulation errors, leading to misalignment with long-term goals. This raises a critical question: Can robotic planning be both efficient and accurate enough for real-time control in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks? To address this, we propose a Latent Space Backward Planning scheme (LBP), which begins by grounding the task into final latent goals, followed by recursively predicting intermediate subgoals closer to the current state. The grounded final goal enables backward subgoal planning to always remain aware of task completion, facilitating on-task prediction along the entire planning horizon. The subgoal-conditioned policy incorporates a learnable token to summarize the subgoal sequences and determines how each subgoal guides action extraction. Through extensive simulation and real-robot long-horizon experiments, we show that LBP outperforms existing fine-grained and forward planning methods, achieving SOTA performance.

Abstract: We introduce the simple idea of adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D reconstruction. Instead of producing an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. More importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined and fixed camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), forming an orbit, which seeks to maximize the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which can then be passed to any multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final result. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA alternatives on the unseen GSO dataset.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration, leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions: First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans, featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500 patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities' anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021 dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\% in the Dice score while maintaining solid robustness. The dataset and code are public via https://github.com/JeMing-creater/HWA-UNETR.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image processing and analysis has important application value in remote sensing, agriculture and environmental monitoring, but its high dimensionality, data redundancy and noise interference etc. bring great challenges to the analysis. Traditional models have limitations in dealing with these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for analysis. In recent years, Diffusion models, as a class of emerging generative approaches, have demonstrated promising capabilities in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing tasks. By simulating the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model are capable of modeling high-dimensional spectral structures, generate high-quality samples, and achieve competitive performance in spectral-spatial denoising tasks and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis, and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing, noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new direction for future research.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a critical challenge for deep neural networks in Continual Learning (CL) as it undermines consolidated knowledge when learning new tasks. Parameter efficient fine tuning CL techniques are gaining traction for their effectiveness in addressing catastrophic forgetting with a lightweight training schedule while avoiding degradation of consolidated knowledge in pre-trained models. However, low rank adapters (LoRA) in these approaches are highly sensitive to rank selection which can lead to sub-optimal resource allocation and performance. To this end, we introduce PEARL, a rehearsal-free CL framework that entails dynamic rank allocation for LoRA components during CL training. Specifically, PEARL leverages reference task weights and adaptively determines the rank of task-specific LoRA components based on the current tasks' proximity to reference task weights in parameter space. To demonstrate the versatility of PEARL, we evaluate it across three vision architectures (ResNet, Separable Convolutional Network and Vision Transformer) and a multitude of CL scenarios, and show that PEARL outperforms all considered baselines by a large margin.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures within Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive reasoning capabilities by selectively activating experts to facilitate structured cognitive processes. Despite notable advances, existing reasoning models often suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like overthinking and underthinking. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel inference-time steering methodology called Reinforcing Cognitive Experts (RICE), designed to improve reasoning performance without additional training or complex heuristics. Leveraging normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (nPMI), we systematically identify specialized experts, termed ''cognitive experts'' that orchestrate meta-level reasoning operations characterized by tokens like ''''. Empirical evaluations with leading MoE-based LRMs (DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B) on rigorous quantitative and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate noticeable and consistent improvements in reasoning accuracy, cognitive efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Crucially, our lightweight approach substantially outperforms prevalent reasoning-steering techniques, such as prompt design and decoding constraints, while preserving the model's general instruction-following skills. These results highlight reinforcing cognitive experts as a promising, practical, and interpretable direction to enhance cognitive efficiency within advanced reasoning models.

<div> Keywords: video enhancement, Transformer-based methods, quantization, multi-frame, progressive distillation<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel method, PMQ-VE, for video enhancement tasks. It addresses the limitations of existing quantization methods by utilizing a two-stage process. The Backtracking-based Multi-Frame Quantization (BMFQ) stage utilizes percentile-based initialization and iterative search with pruning and backtracking to determine clipping bounds. The Progressive Multi-Teacher Distillation (PMTD) stage employs a progressive distillation strategy with full-precision and multiple high-bit teachers to enhance low-bit models' capacity and quality. Experimental results demonstrate that PMQ-VE outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and benchmarks. The proposed framework offers a practical solution for improving the efficiency of Transformer-based video enhancement methods while maintaining performance and preserving fine details.

Abstract: Multi-frame video enhancement tasks aim to improve the spatial and temporal resolution and quality of video sequences by leveraging temporal information from multiple frames, which are widely used in streaming video processing, surveillance, and generation. Although numerous Transformer-based enhancement methods have achieved impressive performance, their computational and memory demands hinder deployment on edge devices. Quantization offers a practical solution by reducing the bit-width of weights and activations to improve efficiency. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to video enhancement tasks often leads to significant performance degradation and loss of fine details. This stems from two limitations: (a) inability to allocate varying representational capacity across frames, which results in suboptimal dynamic range adaptation; (b) over-reliance on full-precision teachers, which limits the learning of low-bit student models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel quantization method for video enhancement: Progressive Multi-Frame Quantization for Video Enhancement (PMQ-VE). This framework features a coarse-to-fine two-stage process: Backtracking-based Multi-Frame Quantization (BMFQ) and Progressive Multi-Teacher Distillation (PMTD). BMFQ utilizes a percentile-based initialization and iterative search with pruning and backtracking for robust clipping bounds. PMTD employs a progressive distillation strategy with both full-precision and multiple high-bit (INT) teachers to enhance low-bit models' capacity and quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks and benchmarks.The code will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/xiaoBIGfeng/PMQ-VE.

Hierarchical contrastive learning aligns EEG representations with CLIP embeddings for zero-shot object recognition. Experimental results on the THINGS-EEG dataset show ViEEG outperforms existing methods with 40.9% Top-1 accuracy in subject-dependent and 22.9% accuracy in cross-subject settings.

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While EEG-based visual decoding has shown promise due to its non-invasive, low-cost nature and millisecond-level temporal resolution, existing methods are limited by their reliance on flat neural representations that overlook the brain's inherent visual hierarchy. In this paper, we introduce ViEEG, a biologically inspired hierarchical EEG decoding framework that aligns with the Hubel-Wiesel theory of visual processing. ViEEG decomposes each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour, foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from V1 to IT to the association cortex. We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning to align EEG representations with CLIP embeddings, enabling zero-shot object recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that ViEEG achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 40.9% Top-1 accuracy in subject-dependent and 22.9% Top-1 accuracy in cross-subject settings, surpassing existing methods by over 45%. Our framework not only advances the performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for biologically grounded brain decoding in AI.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet they are primarily constrained by text-based reasoning processes. However, achieving seamless integration of visual and textual reasoning which mirrors human cognitive processes remains a significant challenge. In particular, effectively incorporating advanced visual input processing into reasoning mechanisms is still an open question. Thus, in this paper, we explore the interleaved multimodal reasoning paradigm and introduce DeepEyes, a model with "thinking with images" capabilities incentivized through end-to-end reinforcement learning without the need for cold-start SFT. Notably, this ability emerges natively within the model itself, leveraging its inherent grounding ability as a tool instead of depending on separate specialized models. Specifically, we propose a tool-use-oriented data selection mechanism and a reward strategy to encourage successful tool-assisted reasoning trajectories. DeepEyes achieves significant performance gains on fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks and also demonstrates improvement in grounding, hallucination, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Interestingly, we observe the distinct evolution of tool-calling behavior from initial exploration to efficient and accurate exploitation, and diverse thinking patterns that closely mirror human visual reasoning processes.

Abstract: Expanding pre-trained zero-shot counting models to handle unseen categories requires more than simply adding new prompts, as this approach does not achieve the necessary alignment between text and visual features for accurate counting. We introduce RichCount, the first framework to address these limitations, employing a two-stage training strategy that enhances text encoding and strengthens the model's association with objects in images. RichCount improves zero-shot counting for unseen categories through two key objectives: (1) enriching text features with a feed-forward network and adapter trained on text-image similarity, thereby creating robust, aligned representations; and (2) applying this refined encoder to counting tasks, enabling effective generalization across diverse prompts and complex images. In this manner, RichCount goes beyond simple prompt expansion to establish meaningful feature alignment that supports accurate counting across novel categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RichCount, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot counting and significantly enhancing generalization to unseen categories in open-world scenarios.

Summary:
The paper introduces a framework for detecting creator intent in multimodal misinformation, crucial for effective information governance. A benchmark dataset called DeceptionDecoded is constructed, consisting of image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. Evaluation of 14 vision-language models on three tasks reveals their shortcomings in recognizing misleading intent, relying on superficial cues and heuristic signals. Current models struggle with accurate intent detection and source attribution. There is a need for intent-aware modeling in multimodal misinformation detection systems to enhance reasoning abilities. New avenues for developing systems capable of deeper understanding of misinformation are identified. <div>

Abstract: The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.

Abstract: Generating photorealistic videos of digital humans in a controllable manner is crucial for a plethora of applications. Existing approaches either build on methods that employ template-based 3D representations or emerging video generation models but suffer from poor quality or limited consistency and identity preservation when generating individual or multiple digital humans. In this paper, we introduce a new interspatial attention (ISA) mechanism as a scalable building block for modern diffusion transformer (DiT)--based video generation models. ISA is a new type of cross attention that uses relative positional encodings tailored for the generation of human videos. Leveraging a custom-developed video variation autoencoder, we train a latent ISA-based diffusion model on a large corpus of video data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for 4D human video synthesis, demonstrating remarkable motion consistency and identity preservation while providing precise control of the camera and body poses.

Summary:
STAR-R1 addresses the gap in spatial reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR). Traditional approaches like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggle in cross-view settings. STAR-R1 integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR, rewarding partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across 11 metrics, surpassing SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. STAR-R1 exhibits anthropomorphic behavior and excels in comparing all objects to improve spatial reasoning. This work provides valuable insights for advancing MLLMs and reasoning models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/zongzhao23/STAR-R1.

<div> Keywords: resampling criterion, lift scores, compositional generation, diffusion models, condition alignment

Summary:
In this paper, a novel resampling criterion using lift scores is proposed to enhance compositional generation in diffusion models. By evaluating whether generated samples align with each single condition and then composing the results, the effectiveness of the composed prompt is determined. The key insight is the efficient approximation of lift scores using only the original diffusion model, without the need for additional training or external modules. An optimized variant is developed to reduce computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments on 2D synthetic data, CLEVR position tasks, and text-to-image synthesis demonstrate the significant improvement in condition alignment for compositional generation. The code for the proposed method is available for access. <div>

Summary: <br />
The article introduces X-GRM, a large feedforward model designed for reconstructing 3D CT volumes from sparse-view 2D X-ray projections. X-GRM utilizes a scalable transformer-based architecture to efficiently encode sparse-view X-ray inputs and a novel volume representation called Voxel-based Gaussian Splatting (VoxGS) for CT volume extraction and differentiable X-ray rendering. This combination of a high-capacity model and flexible volume representation allows X-GRM to generate high-quality reconstructions from various testing inputs, regardless of whether they are in-domain or out-domain X-ray projections. The implementation codes for X-GRM are accessible on GitHub for further exploration and application. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Computed Tomography serves as an indispensable tool in clinical workflows, providing non-invasive visualization of internal anatomical structures. Existing CT reconstruction works are limited to small-capacity model architecture and inflexible volume representation. In this work, we present X-GRM (X-ray Gaussian Reconstruction Model), a large feedforward model for reconstructing 3D CT volumes from sparse-view 2D X-ray projections. X-GRM employs a scalable transformer-based architecture to encode sparse-view X-ray inputs, where tokens from different views are integrated efficiently. Then, these tokens are decoded into a novel volume representation, named Voxel-based Gaussian Splatting (VoxGS), which enables efficient CT volume extraction and differentiable X-ray rendering. This combination of a high-capacity model and flexible volume representation, empowers our model to produce high-quality reconstructions from various testing inputs, including in-domain and out-domain X-ray projections.

Summary:
AGNOSTOS is a new simulation benchmark that evaluates the cross-task zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models in manipulation tasks. It includes 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing and assesses two levels of generalization difficulty. Current VLA models struggle to generalize effectively to these unseen tasks. To address this, X-ICM, a method conditioning large language models on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks, improves cross-task zero-shot generalization. A dynamics-guided sample selection strategy helps identify relevant demonstrations by capturing cross-task dynamics. AGNOSTOS and X-ICM aim to advance general-purpose robotic manipulation by enhancing the generalization capabilities of VLA models.

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models to unseen tasks are crucial to achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation in open-world settings. However, the cross-task generalization capabilities of existing VLA models remain significantly underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce AGNOSTOS, a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation. AGNOSTOS comprises 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing, distinct from common training task distributions, and incorporates two levels of generalization difficulty to assess robustness. Our systematic evaluation reveals that current VLA models, despite being trained on diverse datasets, struggle to generalize effectively to these unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Cross-Task In-Context Manipulation (X-ICM), a method that conditions large language models (LLMs) on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks to predict action sequences for unseen tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dynamics-guided sample selection strategy that identifies relevant demonstrations by capturing cross-task dynamics. On AGNOSTOS, X-ICM significantly improves cross-task zero-shot generalization performance over leading VLAs. We believe AGNOSTOS and X-ICM will serve as valuable tools for advancing general-purpose robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Large multimodal foundation models, particularly in the domains of language and vision, have significantly advanced various tasks, including robotics, autonomous driving, information retrieval, and grounding. However, many of these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark, we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement through fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to facilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the applicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual reality, information retrieval, and other related fields.

Summary: 
This article explores two sampling strategies to improve efficiency in training deep learning object detection models. The first strategy, uniform sampling, distributes samples evenly and randomly across the object dynamics state space. The second strategy, frame difference sampling, focuses on capturing temporal redundancy in video frames. These strategies leverage the Lipschitz continuity property of deep learning models to enhance dataset quality. Experimental results show that these sampling strategies lead to good training performance with fewer manually labeled samples required. Overall, the study highlights the importance of thoughtful sampling techniques in optimizing deep learning model training for object detection tasks.

Abstract: Two sampling strategies are investigated to enhance efficiency in training a deep learning object detection model. These sampling strategies are employed under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity of deep learning models. The first strategy is uniform sampling which seeks to obtain samples evenly yet randomly through the state space of the object dynamics. The second strategy of frame difference sampling is developed to explore the temporal redundancy among successive frames in a video. Experiment result indicates that these proposed sampling strategies provide a dataset that yields good training performance while requiring relatively few manually labelled samples.

Summary: <br />
This article introduces a novel extension to 4D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. The method hierarchically decomposes the dynamic scene into a "video-segment-frame" structure, adjusting segments with optical flow. Instead of directly predicting time-dependent signals, the model represents the signal as a sum of video-constant values, segment-constant values, and frame-specific residuals inspired by residual learning. This approach allows for more flexible models that can adapt to highly variable scenes. The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on various established datasets, showing significant improvements on complex scenes with large movements, occlusions, and fine details, where existing methods struggle the most. <div>

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting methods have emerged as a desirable substitute for prior Radiance Field methods for novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multi-view images or videos. In this work, we propose a novel extension to 4D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. Drawing on ideas from residual learning, we hierarchically decompose the dynamic scene into a "video-segment-frame" structure, with segments dynamically adjusted by optical flow. Then, instead of directly predicting the time-dependent signals, we model the signal as the sum of video-constant values, segment-constant values, and frame-specific residuals, as inspired by the success of residual learning. This approach allows more flexible models that adapt to highly variable scenes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets, with the greatest improvements on complex scenes with large movements, occlusions, and fine details, where current methods degrade most.

Summary:
CoLoRA is a method designed to enhance CNN fine-tuning efficiency by building on the LoRA technique. It offers stable and accurate coarse-tuning with fewer parameters, improving training speed and stability. The method was tested on classifying retinal diseases from OCT images using the OCTMNIST dataset. Experimental results showed a significant increase in accuracy compared to traditional methods, surpassing 1%. CoLoRA's performance was on par with other advanced models like Vision Transformer and State-space discrete, highlighting its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The method showcases the potential to streamline CNN fine-tuning processes and achieve competitive results in medical image analysis. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (CoLoRA) method, designed explicitly to overcome the inefficiencies found in current CNN fine-tuning methods. CoLoRA can be seen as a natural extension of the convolutional architectures of the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by developing and evaluating models using the widely adopted CNN backbone pre-trained on ImageNet. We observed that this strategy results in a stable and accurate coarse-tuning procedure. Moreover, this strategy is computationally efficient and significantly reduces the number of parameters required for fine-tuning compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, our method substantially improves the speed and stability of training. Our case study focuses on classifying retinal diseases from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, specifically using the OCTMNIST dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN backbone fine-tuned with CoLoRA surpasses nearly 1\% in accuracy. Such a performance is comparable to the Vision Transformer, State-space discrete, and Kolmogorov-Arnold network models.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces DART$^3$, a test-time adaptation framework designed to address camera bias in person re-identification models. Camera bias causes representations to cluster based on camera viewpoints rather than identity, leading to performance issues in real-world surveillance systems. DART$^3 leverages a distance-based objective that aligns well with image retrieval tasks like re-identification. Unlike previous methods, DART$^3 does not require source data, architectural changes, or retraining, and can be used in black-box or hybrid settings. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DART$^3 and its lightweight version, DART$^3 LITE, consistently outperform existing test-time adaptation methods, offering a promising solution to mitigate the negative impact of camera bias in surveillance systems.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) models are known to suffer from camera bias, where learned representations cluster according to camera viewpoints rather than identity, leading to significant performance degradation under (inter-camera) domain shifts in real-world surveillance systems when new cameras are added to camera networks. State-of-the-art test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, largely designed for classification tasks, rely on classification entropy-based objectives that fail to generalize well to ReID, thus making them unsuitable for tackling camera bias. In this paper, we introduce DART$^3$, a TTA framework specifically designed to mitigate camera-induced domain shifts in person ReID. DART$^3$ (Distance-Aware Retrieval Tuning at Test Time) leverages a distance-based objective that aligns better with image retrieval tasks like ReID by exploiting the correlation between nearest-neighbor distance and prediction error. Unlike prior ReID-specific domain adaptation methods, DART$^3$ requires no source data, architectural modifications, or retraining, and can be deployed in both fully black-box and hybrid settings. Empirical evaluations on multiple ReID benchmarks indicate that DART$^3$ and DART$^3$ LITE, a lightweight alternative to the approach, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TTA baselines, making for a viable option to online learning to mitigate the adverse effects of camera bias.

Summary:
Pose Splatter is a novel framework that accurately quantifies the pose and appearance of laboratory animals without requiring prior knowledge of animal geometry, manual annotations, or per-frame optimization. The framework leverages shape carving and 3D Gaussian splatting to model complete pose and appearance, providing better low-dimensional pose embeddings compared to state-of-the-art techniques. A rotation-invariant visual embedding technique is proposed to encode pose and appearance, allowing for downstream behavioral analyses. Experiments on datasets of various animals demonstrate that Pose Splatter can learn accurate 3D animal geometries, representing subtle variations in pose and generalizing to unseen data. By eliminating annotation and per-frame optimization bottlenecks, Pose Splatter enables large-scale, longitudinal behavior analysis essential for mapping genotype, neural activity, and micro-behavior with unprecedented resolution. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and scalable quantification of animal pose and appearance is crucial for studying behavior. Current 3D pose estimation techniques, such as keypoint- and mesh-based techniques, often face challenges including limited representational detail, labor-intensive annotation requirements, and expensive per-frame optimization. These limitations hinder the study of subtle movements and can make large-scale analyses impractical. We propose Pose Splatter, a novel framework leveraging shape carving and 3D Gaussian splatting to model the complete pose and appearance of laboratory animals without prior knowledge of animal geometry, per-frame optimization, or manual annotations. We also propose a novel rotation-invariant visual embedding technique for encoding pose and appearance, designed to be a plug-in replacement for 3D keypoint data in downstream behavioral analyses. Experiments on datasets of mice, rats, and zebra finches show Pose Splatter learns accurate 3D animal geometries. Notably, Pose Splatter represents subtle variations in pose, provides better low-dimensional pose embeddings over state-of-the-art as evaluated by humans, and generalizes to unseen data. By eliminating annotation and per-frame optimization bottlenecks, Pose Splatter enables analysis of large-scale, longitudinal behavior needed to map genotype, neural activity, and micro-behavior at unprecedented resolution.

Summary:
Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) is proposed for dataset distillation, using distinguishable and fine-grained concepts from large language models to enhance controllability and interpretability of image generation. The method refines object details by integrating concepts retrieved based on category labels, improving the overall performance in distilling datasets. Unlike previous methods that focused on matching the entire dataset distribution, CONCORD emphasizes concept completeness at the instance level, leading to more accurate and detailed representations of objects. The approach does not rely on pre-trained classifiers, making it more flexible and adaptable to various tasks. By leveraging the power of large language models, CONCORD achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K and its subsets, demonstrating its effectiveness in dataset distillation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones. Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets. The code implementation is released in https://github.com/vimar-gu/CONCORD.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel weakly-supervised framework for predicting accurate mastoidectomy regions in cochlear implant surgery. Mastoidectomy is a critical step that provides access to the cochlea for electrode placement. The proposed method utilizes a 3D T-Distribution loss function to handle the geometric variability of mastoidectomy shapes. Weak supervision is achieved using segmentation results from a prior self-supervised network, eliminating the need for manual data labeling. The framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in predicting clinically relevant mastoidectomy regions, demonstrating robustness and efficiency. The approach has the potential to improve presurgical planning, reduce surgical risks, and enhance outcomes for individuals with severe hearing loss undergoing cochlear implant surgery. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cochlear implant surgery is a treatment for individuals with severe hearing loss. It involves inserting an array of electrodes inside the cochlea to electrically stimulate the auditory nerve and restore hearing sensation. A crucial step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, a surgical intervention that removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone, providing a critical pathway to the cochlea for electrode placement. Accurate prediction of the mastoidectomy region from preoperative imaging assists presurgical planning, reduces surgical risks, and improves surgical outcomes. In previous work, a self-supervised network was introduced to predict the mastoidectomy region using only preoperative CT scans. While promising, the method suffered from suboptimal robustness, limiting its practical application. To address this limitation, we propose a novel weakly-supervised Mamba-based framework to predict accurate mastoidectomy regions directly from preoperative CT scans. Our approach utilizes a 3D T-Distribution loss function inspired by the Student-t distribution, which effectively handles the complex geometric variability inherent in mastoidectomy shapes. Weak supervision is achieved using the segmentation results from the prior self-supervised network to eliminate the need for manual data cleaning or labeling throughout the training process. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating superior performance in predicting accurate and clinically relevant mastoidectomy regions. Our findings highlight the robustness and efficiency of the weakly-supervised learning framework with the proposed novel 3D T-Distribution loss.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for monocular patient-to-image intraoperative registration, specifically designed to operate without any external hardware tracking equipment or fiducial point markers. Leveraging a synthetic microscopy surgical scene dataset with a wide range of transformations, our approach directly maps preoperative CT scans to 2D intraoperative surgical frames through a lightweight neural network for real-time cochlear implant surgery guidance via a zero-shot learning approach. Unlike traditional methods, our framework seamlessly integrates with monocular surgical microscopes, making it highly practical for clinical use without additional hardware dependencies and requirements. Our method estimates camera poses, which include a rotation matrix and a translation vector, by learning from the synthetic dataset, enabling accurate and efficient intraoperative registration. The proposed framework was evaluated on nine clinical cases using a patient-specific and cross-patient validation strategy. Our results suggest that our approach achieves clinically relevant accuracy in predicting 6D camera poses for registering 3D preoperative CT scans to 2D surgical scenes with an angular error within 10 degrees in most cases, while also addressing limitations of traditional methods, such as reliance on external tracking systems or fiducial markers.

Abstract: Recent deep learning models demand larger datasets, driving the need for dataset distillation to create compact, cost-efficient datasets while maintaining performance. Due to the powerful image generation capability of diffusion, it has been introduced to this field for generating distilled images. In this paper, we systematically investigate issues present in current diffusion-based dataset distillation methods, including inaccurate distribution matching, distribution deviation with random noise, and separate sampling. Building on this, we propose D^3HR, a novel diffusion-based framework to generate distilled datasets with high representativeness. Specifically, we adopt DDIM inversion to map the latents of the full dataset from a low-normality latent domain to a high-normality Gaussian domain, preserving information and ensuring structural consistency to generate representative latents for the distilled dataset. Furthermore, we propose an efficient sampling scheme to better align the representative latents with the high-normality Gaussian distribution. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that D^3HR can achieve higher accuracy across different model architectures compared with state-of-the-art baselines in dataset distillation.

Summary:
This paper introduces a new method utilizing large language models (LLMs) to assess exercise quality and provide feedback to patients during rehabilitation. By extracting exercise-specific features from skeletal joints and feeding them into pre-trained LLMs, various prompting techniques are employed to evaluate movements and offer natural language feedback. Through experiments on two rehabilitation exercise datasets, promising results were achieved in exercise assessment, reasoning, and feedback generation. By integrating this approach into virtual rehabilitation platforms, patients can receive support in performing exercises correctly, aiding in their recovery and improving health outcomes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exercise-based rehabilitation improves quality of life and reduces morbidity, mortality, and rehospitalization, though transportation constraints and staff shortages lead to high dropout rates from rehabilitation programs. Virtual platforms enable patients to complete prescribed exercises at home, while AI algorithms analyze performance, deliver feedback, and update clinicians. Although many studies have developed machine learning and deep learning models for exercise quality assessment, few have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for feedback and are limited by the lack of rehabilitation datasets containing textual feedback. In this paper, we propose a new method in which exercise-specific features are extracted from the skeletal joints of patients performing rehabilitation exercises and fed into pre-trained LLMs. Using a range of prompting techniques, such as zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and role-play prompting, LLMs are leveraged to evaluate exercise quality and provide feedback in natural language to help patients improve their movements. The method was evaluated through extensive experiments on two publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets (UI-PRMD and REHAB24-6) and showed promising results in exercise assessment, reasoning, and feedback generation. This approach can be integrated into virtual rehabilitation platforms to help patients perform exercises correctly, support recovery, and improve health outcomes.

<div> Keywords: driving, automated vehicles, cognitive impairment, emotional response, older adults

Summary:
This study investigated emotional responses during takeover requests (TORs) in conditionally automated vehicles among cognitively healthy older adults and those with cognitive impairment. Facial expression analysis was used to measure valence and arousal levels during TORs across different driving conditions. Both groups showed significant changes in valence and arousal during TORs, with cognitively healthy individuals displaying adaptive increases in arousal under higher-demand conditions. In contrast, cognitively impaired individuals exhibited reduced arousal and more positive valence in some scenarios. Between-group comparisons revealed that cognitively impaired drivers had lower arousal and higher valence than controls during TORs. These findings indicate the need for adaptive vehicle systems that can detect affective states and facilitate safe handovers for vulnerable users, such as those with cognitive impairment. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving is a key component of independence and quality of life for older adults. However, cognitive decline associated with conditions such as mild cognitive impairment and dementia can compromise driving safety and often lead to premature driving cessation. Conditionally automated vehicles, which require drivers to take over control when automation reaches its operational limits, offer a potential assistive solution. However, their effectiveness depends on the driver's ability to respond to takeover requests (TORs) in a timely and appropriate manner. Understanding emotional responses during TORs can provide insight into drivers' engagement, stress levels, and readiness to resume control, particularly in cognitively vulnerable populations. This study investigated affective responses, measured via facial expression analysis of valence and arousal, during TORs among cognitively healthy older adults and those with cognitive impairment. Facial affect data were analyzed across different road geometries and speeds to evaluate within- and between-group differences in affective states. Within-group comparisons using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed significant changes in valence and arousal during TORs for both groups. Cognitively healthy individuals showed adaptive increases in arousal under higher-demand conditions, while those with cognitive impairment exhibited reduced arousal and more positive valence in several scenarios. Between-group comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test indicated that cognitively impaired individuals displayed lower arousal and higher valence than controls across different TOR conditions. These findings suggest reduced emotional response and awareness in cognitively impaired drivers, highlighting the need for adaptive vehicle systems that detect affective states and support safe handovers for vulnerable users.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation, particularly in multi-domain scenarios, requires precise preservation of anatomical structures across diverse representations. While deep learning has advanced this field, existing models often struggle with accurate boundary representation, variability in organ morphology, and information loss during downsampling, limiting their accuracy and robustness. To address these challenges, we propose the Context Enhancement Network (CENet), a novel segmentation framework featuring two key innovations. First, the Dual Selective Enhancement Block (DSEB) integrated into skip connections enhances boundary details and improves the detection of smaller organs in a context-aware manner. Second, the Context Feature Attention Module (CFAM) in the decoder employs a multi-scale design to maintain spatial integrity, reduce feature redundancy, and mitigate overly enhanced representations. Extensive evaluations on both radiology and dermoscopic datasets demonstrate that CENet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in multi-organ segmentation and boundary detail preservation, offering a robust and accurate solution for complex medical image analysis tasks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/xmindflow/cenet.

TNG-CLIP introduces a training-time negation data generation pipeline to address CLIP's limitations in negation understanding, generating negation captions during training at only a 2.5% increase in training time. The proposed benchmark Neg-TtoI evaluates text-to-image generation models on prompts with negation, assessing semantic accuracy in image production. TNG-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on various negation benchmarks including image-to-text matching, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong performance across a range of downstream tasks. However, CLIP is still limited in negation understanding: the ability to recognize the absence or exclusion of a concept. Existing methods address the problem by using a large language model (LLM) to generate large-scale data of image captions containing negation for further fine-tuning CLIP. However, these methods are both time- and compute-intensive, and their evaluations are typically restricted to image-text matching tasks. To expand the horizon, we (1) introduce a training-time negation data generation pipeline such that negation captions are generated during the training stage, which only increases 2.5% extra training time, and (2) we propose the first benchmark, Neg-TtoI, for evaluating text-to-image generation models on prompts containing negation, assessing model's ability to produce semantically accurate images. We show that our proposed method, TNG-CLIP, achieves SOTA performance on diverse negation benchmarks of image-to-text matching, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation.

It introduces an in-context consistency learning framework for robust generalization and a two-stage progressive learning strategy to prevent style degradation. The plugin is designed to be fully compatible with arbitrary style LoRAs under the Flux framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniConsistency significantly enhances visual coherence and aesthetic quality, comparable to the proprietary model GPT-4o. <div>
arXiv:2505.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced image stylization significantly, yet two core challenges persist: (1) maintaining consistent stylization in complex scenes, particularly identity, composition, and fine details, and (2) preventing style degradation in image-to-image pipelines with style LoRAs. GPT-4o's exceptional stylization consistency highlights the performance gap between open-source methods and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{OmniConsistency}, a universal consistency plugin leveraging large-scale Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). OmniConsistency contributes: (1) an in-context consistency learning framework trained on aligned image pairs for robust generalization; (2) a two-stage progressive learning strategy decoupling style learning from consistency preservation to mitigate style degradation; and (3) a fully plug-and-play design compatible with arbitrary style LoRAs under the Flux framework. Extensive experiments show that OmniConsistency significantly enhances visual coherence and aesthetic quality, achieving performance comparable to commercial state-of-the-art model GPT-4o.

Summary: 
This work addresses the issue of context bias in object detection training and proposes a causal view linking it to the pooling operation in convolution network architecture. The authors introduce Mask Pooling as an alternative approach that uses foreground masks to separate the pooling process for foreground and background regions, leading to more robust object detection across different domains. A benchmark is also presented to test the robustness of trained models under domain shift scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method. Through experiments with random backgrounds, the study aims to provide a principled approach for minimizing context bias in domain adaptation for object detection. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context bias refers to the association between the foreground objects and background during the object detection training process. Various methods have been proposed to minimize the context bias when applying the trained model to an unseen domain, known as domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD). But a principled approach to understand why the context bias occurs and how to remove it has been missing.
  In this work, we provide a causal view of the context bias, pointing towards the pooling operation in the convolution network architecture as the possible source of this bias. We present an alternative, Mask Pooling, which uses an additional input of foreground masks, to separate the pooling process in the respective foreground and background regions and show that this process leads the trained model to detect objects in a more robust manner under different domains. We also provide a benchmark designed to create an ultimate test for DAOD, using foregrounds in the presence of absolute random backgrounds, to analyze the robustness of the intended trained models. Through these experiments, we hope to provide a principled approach for minimizing context bias under domain shift.

Summary: 
Advances in markerless motion capture are enhancing accessibility to biomechanical movement analysis across various healthcare settings. The challenge lies in efficiently performing analytics on the collected movement data. To address this, a multimodal motion-language model, BiomechGPT, was developed and trained on a diverse dataset of movement trajectories. The model demonstrates high performance in tasks such as activity recognition, identifying movement impairments, diagnosis, scoring clinical outcomes, and measuring walking. The study showcases the potential for using language models to answer clinically meaningful questions about movement, paving the way for a foundation model for rehabilitation movement data. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in markerless motion capture are expanding access to biomechanical movement analysis, making it feasible to obtain high-quality movement data from outpatient clinics, inpatient hospitals, therapy, and even home. Expanding access to movement data in these diverse contexts makes the challenge of performing downstream analytics all the more acute. Creating separate bespoke analysis code for all the tasks end users might want is both intractable and does not take advantage of the common features of human movement underlying them all. Recent studies have shown that fine-tuning language models to accept tokenized movement as an additional modality enables successful descriptive captioning of movement. Here, we explore whether such a multimodal motion-language model can answer detailed, clinically meaningful questions about movement. We collected over 30 hours of biomechanics from nearly 500 participants, many with movement impairments from a variety of etiologies, performing a range of movements used in clinical outcomes assessments. After tokenizing these movement trajectories, we created a multimodal dataset of motion-related questions and answers spanning a range of tasks. We developed BiomechGPT, a multimodal biomechanics-language model, on this dataset. Our results show that BiomechGPT demonstrates high performance across a range of tasks such as activity recognition, identifying movement impairments, diagnosis, scoring clinical outcomes, and measuring walking. BiomechGPT provides an important step towards a foundation model for rehabilitation movement data.

<div> identity consistency, texture realism, facial restoration, honest face, landmark-based evaluation

Summary: 
The article introduces HonestFace, a novel approach for face restoration that focuses on preserving identity consistency and texture realism. The model incorporates an identity embedder to capture essential identity features, a masked face alignment method to enhance fine details and prevent synthetic textures, and a new landmark-based evaluation metric for accurate feature alignment. Leveraging these components in a one-step diffusion model, HonestFace produces high-fidelity and realistic facial reconstructions. Extensive experiments show that the approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and quantitative assessments. The code and pre-trained models for HonestFace will be publicly available on GitHub at the provided link. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face restoration has achieved remarkable advancements through the years of development. However, ensuring that restored facial images exhibit high fidelity, preserve authentic features, and avoid introducing artifacts or biases remains a significant challenge. This highlights the need for models that are more "honest" in their reconstruction from low-quality inputs, accurately reflecting original characteristics. In this work, we propose HonestFace, a novel approach designed to restore faces with a strong emphasis on such honesty, particularly concerning identity consistency and texture realism. To achieve this, HonestFace incorporates several key components. First, we propose an identity embedder to effectively capture and preserve crucial identity features from both the low-quality input and multiple reference faces. Second, a masked face alignment method is presented to enhance fine-grained details and textural authenticity, thereby preventing the generation of patterned or overly synthetic textures and improving overall clarity. Furthermore, we present a new landmark-based evaluation metric. Based on affine transformation principles, this metric improves the accuracy compared to conventional L2 distance calculations for facial feature alignment. Leveraging these contributions within a one-step diffusion model framework, HonestFace delivers exceptional restoration results in terms of facial fidelity and realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both visual quality and quantitative assessments. The code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jkwang28/HonestFace .

<div> Keywords: Plankton, Zooplankton, Computer vision, Dataset, Marine science <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Plankton, including zooplankton, play a crucial role in marine ecosystems. Monitoring zooplankton populations is essential for understanding ocean conditions and predicting seafood productivity. However, analyzing zooplankton in video data is challenging due to their similarity to the background. The ZooplanktonBench dataset addresses this issue by providing images and videos of zooplankton with geospatial metadata. It challenges computer vision systems to detect, classify, and track zooplankton accurately in cluttered environments and differentiate between living and non-living entities. The dataset also includes objects with similar shapes and relatively small sizes, presenting unique challenges for visual understanding. By using ZooplanktonBench, researchers can improve their understanding of zooplankton populations and their interactions with the environment, ultimately advancing marine science research. <div>
arXiv:2505.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plankton are small drifting organisms found throughout the world's oceans. One component of this plankton community is the zooplankton, which includes gelatinous animals and crustaceans (e.g. shrimp), as well as the early life stages (i.e., eggs and larvae) of many commercially important fishes. Being able to monitor zooplankton abundances accurately and understand how populations change in relation to ocean conditions is invaluable to marine science research, with important implications for future marine seafood productivity. While new imaging technologies generate massive amounts of video data of zooplankton, analyzing them using general-purpose computer vision tools developed for general objects turns out to be highly challenging due to the high similarity in appearance between the zooplankton and its background (e.g., marine snow). In this work, we present the ZooplanktonBench, a benchmark dataset containing images and videos of zooplankton associated with rich geospatial metadata (e.g., geographic coordinates, depth, etc.) in various water ecosystems. ZooplanktonBench defines a collection of tasks to detect, classify, and track zooplankton in challenging settings, including highly cluttered environments, living vs non-living classification, objects with similar shapes, and relatively small objects. Our dataset presents unique challenges and opportunities for state-of-the-art computer vision systems to evolve and improve visual understanding in a dynamic environment with huge variations and be geo-aware.

Summary: <br />
This study explores the issue of inadequate three-dimensional context in synthetic datasets for scene text rendering. While recent developments have improved aspects of text generation, most methods still rely on 2D data from posters and book covers, limiting their ability to capture real-world spatial relationships. Traditional 2D datasets lack geometric cues necessary for embedding text accurately. To address this, the proposal introduces a new standard for synthetic datasets incorporating surface normals to enhance 3D scene characteristics. By augmenting 2D data with surface normals, the method aims to improve spatial relationships and provide a stronger foundation for future text rendering techniques. Experimental results show that datasets created under this standard offer enhanced geometric context, advancing text rendering capabilities under complex 3D-spatial conditions. <div>
arXiv:2505.18479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the challenge of insufficient three-dimensional context in synthetic datasets for scene text rendering. Although recent advances in diffusion models and related techniques have improved certain aspects of scene text generation, most existing approaches continue to rely on 2D data, sourcing authentic training examples from movie posters and book covers, which limits their ability to capture the complex interactions among spatial layout and visual effects in real-world scenes. In particular, traditional 2D datasets do not provide the necessary geometric cues for accurately embedding text into diverse backgrounds. To address this limitation, we propose a novel standard for constructing synthetic datasets that incorporates surface normals to enrich three-dimensional scene characteristic. By adding surface normals to conventional 2D data, our approach aims to enhance the representation of spatial relationships and provide a more robust foundation for future scene text rendering methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that datasets built under this new standard offer improved geometric context, facilitating further advancements in text rendering under complex 3D-spatial conditions.

Summary: 
A$^3$Tune is a novel fine-tuning framework designed to address suboptimal attention distribution in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs), which can lead to inaccurate outputs.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) often exhibit suboptimal attention distribution on visual inputs, leading to hallucinated or inaccurate outputs. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on inference-time interventions, which are limited in attention adaptation or require additional supervision. To address this, we propose A$^3$Tune, a novel fine-tuning framework for Automatic Attention Alignment Tuning. A$^3$Tune leverages zero-shot weak labels from SAM, refines them into prompt-aware labels using BioMedCLIP, and then selectively modifies visually-critical attention heads to improve alignment while minimizing interference. Additionally, we introduce a A$^3$MoE module, enabling adaptive parameter selection for attention tuning across diverse prompts and images. Extensive experiments on medical VQA and report generation benchmarks show that A$^3$Tune outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving enhanced attention distributions and performance in Med-LVLMs.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, immiscible diffusion, denoising process, generative diversity, optimal transport

Summary: 
This paper introduces Immiscible Diffusion as an efficient training method for diffusion models. By reducing mixing in the noise space through miscibility reduction at any layer, the denoising process is simplified, leading to faster training. The bijective nature of the denoising process ensures the preservation of generative diversity in the models. Various implementations, including K-nearest neighbor noise selection and image scaling, are proposed to reduce miscibility and accelerate training. Through empirical analysis, the benefits of immiscibility in easing denoising and improving efficiency are highlighted. The paper also discusses how optimal transport enhances diffusion training by addressing trajectory miscibility as a key bottleneck. This work opens up new possibilities for high-efficiency diffusion training and offers insights for future research in this area.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substantial training cost of diffusion models hinders their deployment. Immiscible Diffusion recently showed that reducing diffusion trajectory mixing in the noise space via linear assignment accelerates training by simplifying denoising. To extend immiscible diffusion beyond the inefficient linear assignment under high batch sizes and high dimensions, we refine this concept to a broader miscibility reduction at any layer and by any implementation. Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the bijective nature of the denoising process with respect to immiscible diffusion, ensuring its preservation of generative diversity. Moreover, we provide thorough analysis and show step-by-step how immiscibility eases denoising and improves efficiency. Extending beyond linear assignment, we propose a family of implementations including K-nearest neighbor (KNN) noise selection and image scaling to reduce miscibility, achieving up to >4x faster training across diverse models and tasks including unconditional/conditional generation, image editing, and robotics planning. Furthermore, our analysis of immiscibility offers a novel perspective on how optimal transport (OT) enhances diffusion training. By identifying trajectory miscibility as a fundamental bottleneck, we believe this work establishes a potentially new direction for future research into high-efficiency diffusion training.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a novel multimodal framework for 3D medical image segmentation using Mamba and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to efficiently model long sequences. The framework includes an Enhanced Gated Spatial Convolution (EGSC) module to capture spatial information in 3D imaging, a 3D-Group-Rational KAN (3D-GR-KAN) for superior feature representation in volumetric data, and a dual-branch text-driven strategy leveraging CLIP's text embeddings. By combining advanced sequence modeling, extended network architectures, and vision-language synergy, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) and KiTS23 datasets, surpassing existing approaches in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment but is challenged by high-dimensional data and complex spatial dependencies. Traditional single-modality networks, such as CNNs and Transformers, are often limited by computational inefficiency and constrained contextual modeling in 3D settings. We introduce a novel multimodal framework that leverages Mamba and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an efficient backbone for long-sequence modeling. Our approach features three key innovations: First, an EGSC (Enhanced Gated Spatial Convolution) module captures spatial information when unfolding 3D images into 1D sequences. Second, we extend Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN), a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks variant with rational basis functions, into 3D-Group-Rational KAN (3D-GR-KAN) for 3D medical imaging - its first application in this domain - enabling superior feature representation tailored to volumetric data. Third, a dual-branch text-driven strategy leverages CLIP's text embeddings: one branch swaps one-hot labels for semantic vectors to preserve inter-organ semantic relationships, while the other aligns images with detailed organ descriptions to enhance semantic alignment. Experiments on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) and KiTS23 datasets show our method achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in accuracy and efficiency. This work highlights the power of combining advanced sequence modeling, extended network architectures, and vision-language synergy to push forward 3D medical image segmentation, delivering a scalable solution for clinical use.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces ThinkVideo, a framework that utilizes zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompts to enhance Video Object Segmentation by integrating temporal and spatial information for improved performance on videos with complex queries. ThinkVideo extracts object selectivities linked to keyframes using CoT prompts and bridges image segmentation and video processing models. The framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs, enabling Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. Additionally, ThinkVideo is extended for online video streams to update the object of interest in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in both explicit and implicit query scenarios, showcasing qualitative and quantitative advancements in video object segmentation tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning Video Object Segmentation is a challenging task, which generates a mask sequence from an input video and an implicit, complex text query. Existing works probe into the problem by finetuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for segmentation-based output, while still falling short in difficult cases on videos given temporally-sensitive queries, primarily due to the failure to integrate temporal and spatial information. In this paper, we propose ThinkVideo, a novel framework which leverages the zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these challenges. Specifically, ThinkVideo utilizes the CoT prompts to extract object selectivities associated with particular keyframes, then bridging the reasoning image segmentation model and SAM2 video processor to output mask sequences. The ThinkVideo framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs, which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. We further extend the framework for online video streams, where the CoT is used to update the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with explicit and implicit queries. The results show that ThinkVideo significantly outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.

<div> RGB videos, gait recognition, denoising, generative diffusion models, feature matching <br />
Summary:<br />
The article presents DenoisingGait, a new method for gait recognition that removes irrelevant cues from walking videos. The approach utilizes generative diffusion models to filter out distractions and enhance gait understanding by condensing diffusion features into a Gait Feature Field representation. The proposed Feature Matching module captures local gait appearance and motion structures, improving the denoising process. Experiments on multiple datasets show that DenoisingGait achieves state-of-the-art performance for gait recognition tasks. The method outperforms traditional silhouette- and pose-based techniques by effectively removing background noise and enhancing the accuracy of gait analysis. The code for DenoisingGait is available on GitHub for further research and application in gait recognition systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.18582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To capture individual gait patterns, excluding identity-irrelevant cues in walking videos, such as clothing texture and color, remains a persistent challenge for vision-based gait recognition. Traditional silhouette- and pose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such distractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less informative inputs. Emerging end-to-end methods address this by directly denoising RGB videos using human priors. Building on this trend, we propose DenoisingGait, a novel gait denoising method. Inspired by the philosophy that "what I cannot create, I do not understand", we turn to generative diffusion models, uncovering how they partially filter out irrelevant factors for gait understanding. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-driven Feature Matching module, which, combined with background removal via human silhouettes, condenses the multi-channel diffusion features at each foreground pixel into a two-channel direction vector. Specifically, the proposed within- and cross-frame matching respectively capture the local vectorized structures of gait appearance and motion, producing a novel flow-like gait representation termed Gait Feature Field, which further reduces residual noise in diffusion features. Experiments on the CCPG, CASIA-B*, and SUSTech1K datasets demonstrate that DenoisingGait achieves a new SoTA performance in most cases for both within- and cross-domain evaluations. Code is available at https://github.com/ShiqiYu/OpenGait.

<div> Keywords: Pre-trained stable diffusion models, Diffusion Transformers, massive activations, Adaptive Layer Norm, visual correspondence.

Summary: 
The study explores the effectiveness of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in dense correspondence tasks, noting that DiTs suffer from issues related to massive activations that hinder performance. The phenomenon of massive activations concentrating on a few fixed dimensions across image patch tokens leads to uninformative representations. The researchers propose a solution called Diffusion Transformer Feature (DiTF) which utilizes Adaptive Layer Norm (AdaLN) to localize and normalize massive activations with channel-wise modulation. Additionally, a channel discard strategy is implemented to mitigate the negative impact of massive activations. Experimental results demonstrate that DiTF outperforms existing models like DINO and SD-based models, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance in various visual correspondence tasks (+9.4% on Spair-71k and +4.4% on AP-10K-C.S.). <div>
arXiv:2505.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained stable diffusion models (SD) have shown great advances in visual correspondence. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for accurate dense correspondence. Distinct from SD, DiTs exhibit a critical phenomenon in which very few feature activations exhibit significantly larger values than others, known as \textit{massive activations}, leading to uninformative representations and significant performance degradation for DiTs. The massive activations consistently concentrate at very few fixed dimensions across all image patch tokens, holding little local information. We trace these dimension-concentrated massive activations and find that such concentration can be effectively localized by the zero-initialized Adaptive Layer Norm (AdaLN-zero). Building on these findings, we propose Diffusion Transformer Feature (DiTF), a training-free framework designed to extract semantic-discriminative features from DiTs. Specifically, DiTF employs AdaLN to adaptively localize and normalize massive activations with channel-wise modulation. In addition, we develop a channel discard strategy to further eliminate the negative impacts from massive activations. Experimental results demonstrate that our DiTF outperforms both DINO and SD-based models and establishes a new state-of-the-art performance for DiTs in different visual correspondence tasks (\eg, with +9.4\% on Spair-71k and +4.4\% on AP-10K-C.S.).

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors propose a foreground-guided enhancement strategy for Soft MoE models in vision architectures. They observe that dispatch weights in Soft MoE exhibit segmentation-like patterns but are not aligned with semantic regions, leading to suboptimal expert routing. To address this, the authors introduce a spatially aware auxiliary loss that encourages expert activation to align with semantic foreground regions. They also integrate a LayerScale mechanism to improve information flow and optimization stability in skip connections. Their method requires minor architectural adjustments and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Soft MoE frameworks. Experimental results on ImageNet-1K and smaller-scale classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements and more interpretable expert routing mechanisms. This approach enhances training stability and aligns expert activation with semantic regions for improved image classification. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising direction for scaling vision architectures efficiently. Among them, Soft MoE improves training stability by assigning each token to all experts via continuous dispatch weights. However, current designs overlook the semantic structure which is implicitly encoded in these weights, resulting in suboptimal expert routing. In this paper, we discover that dispatch weights in Soft MoE inherently exhibit segmentation-like patterns but are not explicitly aligned with semantic regions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a foreground-guided enhancement strategy. Specifically, we introduce a spatially aware auxiliary loss that encourages expert activation to align with semantic foreground regions. To further reinforce this supervision, we integrate a lightweight LayerScale mechanism that improves information flow and stabilizes optimization in skip connections. Our method necessitates only minor architectural adjustments and can be seamlessly integrated into prevailing Soft MoE frameworks. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and multiple smaller-scale classification benchmarks not only showcase consistent performance enhancements but also reveal more interpretable expert routing mechanisms.

Abstract: Deepfakes pose a significant threat to digital media security, with current detection methods struggling to generalize across different manipulation techniques and datasets. While recent approaches combine CNN-based architectures with Vision Transformers or leverage multi-modal learning, they remain limited by the inherent constraints of RGB data. We introduce HyperFake, a novel deepfake detection pipeline that reconstructs 31-channel hyperspectral data from standard RGB videos, revealing hidden manipulation traces invisible to conventional methods. Using an improved MST++ architecture, HyperFake enhances hyperspectral reconstruction, while a spectral attention mechanism selects the most critical spectral features for deepfake detection. The refined spectral data is then processed by an EfficientNet-based classifier optimized for spectral analysis, enabling more accurate and generalizable detection across different deepfake styles and datasets, all without the need for expensive hyperspectral cameras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage hyperspectral imaging reconstruction for deepfake detection, opening new possibilities for detecting increasingly sophisticated manipulations.

arXiv:2505.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language retrieval (VLR) has attracted significant attention in both academia and industry, which involves using text (or images) as queries to retrieve corresponding images (or text). However, existing methods often neglect the rich visual semantics knowledge of entities, thus leading to incorrect retrieval results. To address this problem, we propose the Entity Visual Description enhanced CLIP (EvdCLIP), designed to leverage the visual knowledge of entities to enrich queries. Specifically, since humans recognize entities through visual cues, we employ a large language model (LLM) to generate Entity Visual Descriptions (EVDs) as alignment cues to complement textual data. These EVDs are then integrated into raw queries to create visually-rich, EVD-enhanced queries. Furthermore, recognizing that EVD-enhanced queries may introduce noise or low-quality expansions, we develop a novel, trainable EVD-aware Rewriter (EaRW) for vision-language retrieval tasks. EaRW utilizes EVD knowledge and the generative capabilities of the language model to effectively rewrite queries. With our specialized training strategy, EaRW can generate high-quality and low-noise EVD-enhanced queries. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on image-text retrieval benchmarks validate the superiority of EvdCLIP on vision-language retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Modern single-image super-resolution (SISR) models deliver photo-realistic results at the scale factors on which they are trained, but collapse when asked to magnify far beyond that regime. We address this scalability bottleneck with Chain-of-Zoom (CoZ), a model-agnostic framework that factorizes SISR into an autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states with multi-scale-aware prompts. CoZ repeatedly re-uses a backbone SR model, decomposing the conditional probability into tractable sub-problems to achieve extreme resolutions without additional training. Because visual cues diminish at high magnifications, we augment each zoom step with multi-scale-aware text prompts generated by a vision-language model (VLM). The prompt extractor itself is fine-tuned using Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a critic VLM, aligning text guidance towards human preference. Experiments show that a standard 4x diffusion SR model wrapped in CoZ attains beyond 256x enlargement with high perceptual quality and fidelity.

<div> Masking, Causal attention, Vision-language models, Future context, Semantic representation <br />
Summary: <br />
- Causal attention is crucial in vision-language models, but existing mask strategies are not well adapted for vision tokens. 
- Rigid masking of future positions hampers the model's ability to capture useful contextual semantic representations. 
- Previewing future tokens for vision queries shows the limitations of current masking strategies. 
- A proposed lightweight attention family aggregates future visual context into past representations via pooling, enhancing cross-token dependencies. 
- Selectively compressing future semantic context into past representations benefits vision-language inference. <div>
arXiv:2505.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal attention has become a foundational mechanism in autoregressive vision-language models (VLMs), unifying textual and visual inputs under a single generative framework. However, existing causal mask-based strategies are inherited from large language models (LLMs) where they are tailored for text-only decoding, and their adaptation to vision tokens is insufficiently addressed in the prefill stage. Strictly masking future positions for vision queries introduces overly rigid constraints, which hinder the model's ability to leverage future context that often contains essential semantic cues for accurate inference. In this work, we empirically investigate how different causal masking strategies affect vision-language inference and then propose a family of future-aware attentions tailored for this setting. We first empirically analyze the effect of previewing future tokens for vision queries and demonstrate that rigid masking undermines the model's capacity to capture useful contextual semantic representations. Based on these findings, we propose a lightweight attention family that aggregates future visual context into past representations via pooling, effectively preserving the autoregressive structure while enhancing cross-token dependencies. We evaluate a range of causal masks across diverse vision-language inference settings and show that selectively compressing future semantic context into past representations benefits the inference.

<div> Keywords: Spiking Transformers, low-frequency information preference, Max-Pooling, high-pass filtering, Max-Former <br />
Summary:<br />
- Spiking Transformers are energy-efficient but have lower performance compared to artificial neural networks due to the rapid dissipation of high-frequency components. 
- Spiking neurons tend to preferentially propagate low-frequency information, which can lead to a degradation in feature representation and accuracy.
- Using Max-Pooling instead of Avg-Pooling can improve performance on tasks such as Cifar-100, demonstrating the importance of preserving high-frequency signals.
- The Max-Former model introduced in this work includes frequency-enhancing operators to restore high-frequency information, resulting in improved accuracy on ImageNet.
- The Max-Former achieves a top-1 accuracy of 82.39% on ImageNet, outperforming the Spikformer baseline in terms of accuracy while maintaining a comparable model size.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Transformers offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning by transmitting information solely through binary (0/1) spikes. However, there remains a substantial performance gap compared to artificial neural networks. A common belief is that their binary and sparse activation transmission leads to information loss, thus degrading feature representation and accuracy. In this work, however, we reveal for the first time that spiking neurons preferentially propagate low-frequency information. We hypothesize that the rapid dissipation of high-frequency components is the primary cause of performance degradation. For example, on Cifar-100, adopting Avg-Pooling (low-pass) for token mixing lowers performance to 76.73%; interestingly, replacing it with Max-Pooling (high-pass) pushes the top-1 accuracy to 79.12%, surpassing the well-tuned Spikformer baseline by 0.97%. Accordingly, we introduce Max-Former that restores high-frequency signals through two frequency-enhancing operators: extra Max-Pooling in patch embedding and Depth-Wise Convolution in place of self-attention. Notably, our Max-Former (63.99 M) hits the top-1 accuracy of 82.39% on ImageNet, showing a +7.58% improvement over Spikformer with comparable model size (74.81%, 66.34 M). We hope this simple yet effective solution inspires future research to explore the distinctive nature of spiking neural networks, beyond the established practice in standard deep learning.

Summary:
The article presents a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization in text-to-image generation. The approach leverages the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), incorporating a Mod-Adapter module to predict concept-specific modulation directions. Vision-language cross-attention is used to extract concept visual features, aided by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers to map concept features to the modulation space. A VLM-guided pretraining strategy is implemented to bridge the gap between concept image and modulation spaces. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, showcasing improvements in both object and abstract concepts. Results are supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations. <div>

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of user-provided concepts in diverse contexts. Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.

<div> Keywords: 3D Gaussian Splatting, novel view synthesis, SuperGS, high-resolution, multi-view consistent densification

Summary: 
SuperGS is a novel method developed to improve high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) by addressing the challenges faced by 3D Gaussian Splatting. It features a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework, utilizing a latent feature field to represent the low-resolution scene in the initial stage, and a multi-view consistent densification strategy in the high-resolution stage. This strategy involves backprojecting high-resolution depth maps based on error maps and employing a multi-view voting mechanism to enhance scene reconstruction accuracy. Uncertainty modeling through variational feature learning guides scene representation refinement and supervisory adjustment, ensuring detailed and consistent reconstruction. SuperGS outperforms existing HRNVS methods on both forward-facing and 360-degree datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in generating high-quality novel views. <div>

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has excelled in novel view synthesis (NVS) with its real-time rendering capabilities and superior quality. However, it encounters challenges for high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) due to the coarse nature of primitives derived from low-resolution input views. To address this issue, we propose SuperGS, an expansion of Scaffold-GS designed with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework. In the low-resolution stage, we introduce a latent feature field to represent the low-resolution scene, which serves as both the initialization and foundational information for super-resolution optimization. In the high-resolution stage, we propose a multi-view consistent densification strategy that backprojects high-resolution depth maps based on error maps and employs a multi-view voting mechanism, mitigating ambiguities caused by multi-view inconsistencies in the pseudo labels provided by 2D prior models while avoiding Gaussian redundancy. Furthermore, we model uncertainty through variational feature learning and use it to guide further scene representation refinement and adjust the supervisory effect of pseudo-labels, ensuring consistent and detailed scene reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGS outperforms state-of-the-art HRNVS methods on both forward-facing and 360-degree datasets.

<div> action control, action prediction, world models, autonomous driving, ProphetDWM

Summary:
ProphetDWM introduces a novel driving world model that integrates action control and action prediction capabilities. The model jointly predicts future videos and actions, learning latent actions and state distributions through an action module and diffusion-model-based transition module. By training the model to predict actions and videos simultaneously, it enables long-term future prediction and improves video consistency and action prediction accuracy. Evaluated on the Nuscenes dataset, ProphetDWM outperforms existing methods in both video generation and action prediction tasks, showcasing its ability to generate high-quality long-term videos and actions in autonomous driving scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2505.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world driving requires people to observe the current environment, anticipate the future, and make appropriate driving decisions. This requirement is aligned well with the capabilities of world models, which understand the environment and predict the future. However, recent world models in autonomous driving are built explicitly, where they could predict the future by controllable driving video generation. We argue that driving world models should have two additional abilities: action control and action prediction. Following this line, previous methods are limited because they predict the video requires given actions of the same length as the video and ignore the dynamical action laws. To address these issues, we propose ProphetDWM, a novel end-to-end driving world model that jointly predicts future videos and actions. Our world model has an action module to learn latent action from the present to the future period by giving the action sequence and observations. And a diffusion-model-based transition module to learn the state distribution. The model is jointly trained by learning latent actions given finite states and predicting action and video. The joint learning connects the action dynamics and states and enables long-term future prediction. We evaluate our method in video generation and action prediction tasks on the Nuscenes dataset. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best video consistency and best action prediction accuracy, while also enabling high-quality long-term video and action generation.

<div> feature extraction, relative pose estimation, keypoint detection, absolute positioning, visual localization

Summary:
This new research introduces a hierarchical localization framework for robust long-term visual localization in complex industrial environments. The framework combines the strengths of handcrafted and learned features, optimizing handcrafted features for continuous tracking and using learned features for wide-baseline matching. The approach involves real-time handcrafted feature extraction for relative pose estimation and selective learned keypoint detection on optimized keyframes for absolute positioning. The framework is designed for CPU-efficient long-term visual localization, addressing issues of illumination sensitivity and computational intensity faced by existing methods. Three validation phases confirm the complementarity of features, demonstrate reduced error rates, and improved localization consistency. The code implementation is available publicly, allowing for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Robust long-term visual localization in complex industrial environments is critical for mobile robotic systems. Existing approaches face limitations: handcrafted features are illumination-sensitive, learned features are computationally intensive, and semantic- or marker-based methods are environmentally constrained. Handcrafted and learned features share similar representations but differ functionally. Handcrafted features are optimized for continuous tracking, while learned features excel in wide-baseline matching. Their complementarity calls for integration rather than replacement. Building on this, we propose a hierarchical localization framework. It leverages real-time handcrafted feature extraction for relative pose estimation. In parallel, it employs selective learned keypoint detection on optimized keyframes for absolute positioning. This design enables CPU-efficient, long-term visual localization. Experiments systematically progress through three validation phases: Initially establishing feature complementarity through comparative analysis, followed by computational latency profiling across algorithm stages on CPU platforms. Final evaluation under photometric variations (including seasonal transitions and diurnal cycles) demonstrates 47% average error reduction with significantly improved localization consistency. The code implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/linyicheng1/ORB_SLAM3_localization.

<div> Keywords: AI, generative models, social media, forgery detection, dataset <br />

Summary: 
This article introduces a new dataset called So-Fake-Set, designed specifically for social media applications, containing over 2 million high-quality images generated by 35 state-of-the-art AI-powered generative models. To test the robustness of forgery detection methods, a large-scale out-of-domain benchmark called So-Fake-OOD is established, featuring synthetic imagery from commercial models not included in the training data. A new vision-language framework, So-Fake-R1, is developed using reinforcement learning for accurate forgery detection, precise localization, and explainable inference with interpretable visual rationales. Experimental results show that So-Fake-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, with a 1.3% increase in detection accuracy and a 4.5% improvement in localization IoU. This work sets a new standard for forgery detection research in social media, providing a scalable dataset, a challenging benchmark, and an advanced detection framework for future studies. The code, models, and datasets will be made publicly available. <div>
arXiv:2505.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope: current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K) out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code, models, and datasets will be released publicly.

Summary: 
Progressive Bounded Quantization (PBQ) and Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) are integrated into DVD-Quant, a Data-free quantization framework for Video Diffusion Transformers. This approach reduces quantization error without the need for calibration data. Additionally, $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS) enables adaptive bit-width allocation.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture for video generation, yet their computational and memory demands hinder practical deployment. While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on lengthy, computation-heavy calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) Progressive Bounded Quantization (PBQ) and (2) Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS) for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately 2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on HunyuanVideo while maintaining visual fidelity. Notably, DVD-Quant is the first to enable W4A4 PTQ for Video DiTs without compromising video quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/lhxcs/DVD-Quant.

Abstract: Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information. However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 330 chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning, 2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

<br />Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach for restoring real-world degraded images, such as old photographs or low-resolution images. The proposed method combines a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model with the Internal Image Detail Enhancement (IIDE) technique to preserve essential structural and textural information while mitigating degradation effects. By simulating various degradation factors in a latent space, the model effectively restores images with higher fidelity compared to existing state-of-the-art models. Additionally, the method supports text-guided restoration, enabling object-level colorization control for professional-level editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach in both qualitative and perceptual quantitative evaluations. <div>

Abstract: Restoring real-world degraded images, such as old photographs or low-resolution images, presents a significant challenge due to the complex, mixed degradations they exhibit, such as scratches, color fading, and noise. Recent data-driven approaches have struggled with two main challenges: achieving high-fidelity restoration and providing object-level control over colorization. While diffusion models have shown promise in generating high-quality images with specific controls, they often fail to fully preserve image details during restoration. In this work, we propose an internal detail-preserving diffusion model for high-fidelity restoration of real-world degraded images. Our method utilizes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model as a generative prior, eliminating the need to train a model from scratch. Central to our approach is the Internal Image Detail Enhancement (IIDE) technique, which directs the diffusion model to preserve essential structural and textural information while mitigating degradation effects. The process starts by mapping the input image into a latent space, where we inject the diffusion denoising process with degradation operations that simulate the effects of various degradation factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both qualitative assessments and perceptual quantitative evaluations. Additionally, our approach supports text-guided restoration, enabling object-level colorization control that mimics the expertise of professional photo editing.

Summary:
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown progress in visual tasks, including fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning. The ReasonMap benchmark assesses MLLMs' abilities using high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities. Evaluations on 15 models reveal a surprising trend: open-source base models outperform reasoning variants, while closed-source models show the opposite. Performance decreases when visual inputs are masked, indicating the necessity of genuine visual perception for fine-grained visual reasoning tasks. This study provides insights into visual reasoning and highlights differences between open-source and closed-source models. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13 countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants, reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap between open-source and closed-source models.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new framework called MIRAGE for Image Restoration (IR), which utilizes three parallel branches for processing input features with different modules. It addresses the issue of structural diversity in degraded images, enabling better generalization across various types of degradations. A cross-layer contrastive learning approach is employed to enhance feature representation discriminability by aligning shallow and latent features. The contrastive learning is performed in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space, rather than the conventional Euclidean space, to capture underlying geometry effectively. MIRAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance in different degradation types, offering an efficient solution for all-in-one IR scenarios. The code and models of MIRAGE will be made publicly available, promoting scalability and reproducibility in the field of image restoration. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Restoration (IR) aims to recover high quality images from degraded inputs affected by various corruptions such as noise, blur, haze, rain, and low light conditions. Despite recent advances, most existing approaches treat IR as a direct mapping problem, relying on shared representations across degradation types without modeling their structural diversity. In this work, we present MIRAGE, a unified and lightweight framework for all in one IR that explicitly decomposes the input feature space into three semantically aligned parallel branches, each processed by a specialized module attention for global context, convolution for local textures, and MLP for channel-wise statistics. This modular decomposition significantly improves generalization and efficiency across diverse degradations. Furthermore, we introduce a cross layer contrastive learning scheme that aligns shallow and latent features to enhance the discriminability of shared representations. To better capture the underlying geometry of feature representations, we perform contrastive learning in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space rather than the conventional Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that MIRAGE not only achieves new state of the art performance across a variety of degradation types but also offers a scalable solution for challenging all-in-one IR scenarios. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://amazingren.github.io/MIRAGE/.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces WeakMCN, a multi-task collaborative network for weakly supervised referring expression comprehension (WREC) and segmentation (WRES). By combining these tasks in a dual-branch architecture, WeakMCN utilizes anchor-based contrastive learning in WREC to supervise WRES. Innovative designs such as Dynamic Visual Feature Enhancement (DVFE) and Collaborative Consistency Module (CCM) facilitate multi-task collaboration. Experimental results on benchmarks like RefCOCO show improvements over single-task methods, up to 3.91% for WREC and 13.11% for WRES. WeakMCN also demonstrates strong generalization in semi-supervised settings, achieving +8.94% for semi-REC and +7.71% for semi-RES with only 1% supervision. The code for WeakMCN is available on GitHub for replication and further research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly supervised referring expression comprehension(WREC) and segmentation(WRES) aim to learn object grounding based on a given expression using weak supervision signals like image-text pairs. While these tasks have traditionally been modeled separately, we argue that they can benefit from joint learning in a multi-task framework. To this end, we propose WeakMCN, a novel multi-task collaborative network that effectively combines WREC and WRES with a dual-branch architecture. Specifically, the WREC branch is formulated as anchor-based contrastive learning, which also acts as a teacher to supervise the WRES branch. In WeakMCN, we propose two innovative designs to facilitate multi-task collaboration, namely Dynamic Visual Feature Enhancement(DVFE) and Collaborative Consistency Module(CCM). DVFE dynamically combines various pre-trained visual knowledge to meet different task requirements, while CCM promotes cross-task consistency from the perspective of optimization. Extensive experimental results on three popular REC and RES benchmarks, i.e., RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, consistently demonstrate performance gains of WeakMCN over state-of-the-art single-task alternatives, e.g., up to 3.91% and 13.11% on RefCOCO for WREC and WRES tasks, respectively. Furthermore, experiments also validate the strong generalization ability of WeakMCN in both semi-supervised REC and RES settings against existing methods, e.g., +8.94% for semi-REC and +7.71% for semi-RES on 1% RefCOCO.

Summary: 
AIEdiT is introduced for Affective Image Editing, focusing on understanding users' emotional requests. The model shapes multiple emotional factors in images to evoke specific emotions based on continuous emotional spectrum and nuanced requests. An emotional mapper translates abstract emotional requests to concrete representations and an MLLM supervises model training for precise results. During inference, visual elements are strategically distorted to shape emotional factors according to users' instructions. A large-scale dataset, emotion-aligned text and image pairs, aids training and evaluation. Extensive experiments show AIEdiT's superior performance in accurately reflecting users' emotional requests.

Abstract: In daily life, images as common affective stimuli have widespread applications. Despite significant progress in text-driven image editing, there is limited work focusing on understanding users' emotional requests. In this paper, we introduce AIEdiT for Affective Image Editing using Text descriptions, which evokes specific emotions by adaptively shaping multiple emotional factors across the entire images. To represent universal emotional priors, we build the continuous emotional spectrum and extract nuanced emotional requests. To manipulate emotional factors, we design the emotional mapper to translate visually-abstract emotional requests to visually-concrete semantic representations. To ensure that editing results evoke specific emotions, we introduce an MLLM to supervise the model training. During inference, we strategically distort visual elements and subsequently shape corresponding emotional factors to edit images according to users' instructions. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale dataset that includes the emotion-aligned text and image pair set for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AIEdiT achieves superior performance, effectively reflecting users' emotional requests.

Summary: The article introduces the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a new framework designed to improve geo-localization tasks by enhancing Visual Language Models (VLMs) with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. Three key components of the GRE Suite are highlighted: the GRE30K dataset, the GRE model with a multi-stage reasoning strategy, and the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench). The GRE Suite aims to address current limitations in geo-localization tasks by enabling fine-grained visual and contextual analysis, narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision, and providing a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing localization performance across diverse scenes. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the GRE Suite compared to existing methods in complex geographic inference tasks. Code and data for the GRE Suite will be made available on GitHub for further exploration and development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference.

Summary: <br />
Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with routine mammography screening playing a vital role in reducing mortality rates. This study compared the performance of ConvNeXT and EfficientNet, two convolutional neural networks, in predicting the likelihood of breast cancer in mammograms. The models were evaluated based on various metrics, with ConvNeXT outperforming EfficientNet with a higher AUC score, accuracy, and F-score on the RSNA screening mammography dataset. The findings indicate that ConvNeXT is more effective in detecting breast cancer from screening exams, highlighting the importance of advanced technologies in early cancer detection. Efficient and accurate classification of mammograms can significantly impact patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions and treatment. <div>

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide. This cancer caused 670,000 deaths globally in 2022, as reported by the WHO. Yet since health officials began routine mammography screening in age groups deemed at risk in the 1980s, breast cancer mortality has decreased by 40% in high-income nations. Every day, a greater and greater number of people are receiving a breast cancer diagnosis. Reducing cancer-related deaths requires early detection and treatment. This paper compares two convolutional neural networks called ConvNeXT and EfficientNet to predict the likelihood of cancer in mammograms from screening exams. Preprocessing of the images, classification, and performance evaluation are main parts of the whole procedure. Several evaluation metrics were used to compare and evaluate the performance of the models. The result shows that ConvNeXT generates better results with a 94.33% AUC score, 93.36% accuracy, and 95.13% F-score compared to EfficientNet with a 92.34% AUC score, 91.47% accuracy, and 93.06% F-score on RSNA screening mammography breast cancer dataset.

Summary:
The article introduces a new dataset called Multi-Drone Multi-Object Tracking (MDMOT) for free-viewpoint multi-object tracking (MVMOT). It addresses the lack of studies in genuinely free-viewpoint MVMOT systems by capturing diverse real-world scenarios using mobile drone swarms. The dataset aims to establish a benchmark for multi-object tracking in arbitrary multi-view environments. The proposed FusionTrack framework integrates tracking and re-identification to leverage multi-view information for robust trajectory association. Extensive experiments on the MDMOT dataset and other benchmarks show that FusionTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-view and multi-view tracking.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object tracking (MVMOT) has found widespread applications in intelligent transportation, surveillance systems, and urban management. However, existing studies rarely address genuinely free-viewpoint MVMOT systems, which could significantly enhance the flexibility and scalability of cooperative tracking systems. To bridge this gap, we first construct the Multi-Drone Multi-Object Tracking (MDMOT) dataset, captured by mobile drone swarms across diverse real-world scenarios, initially establishing the first benchmark for multi-object tracking in arbitrary multi-view environment. Building upon this foundation, we propose \textbf{FusionTrack}, an end-to-end framework that reasonably integrates tracking and re-identification to leverage multi-view information for robust trajectory association. Extensive experiments on our MDMOT and other benchmark datasets demonstrate that FusionTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-view and multi-view tracking.

<div> Keywords: text-to-image generation, evaluation benchmarks, real-world knowledge, alignment, Multimodal Large Language Models

Summary:
The paper introduces a new benchmark called Align Beyond Prompts (ABP) for evaluating text-to-image (T2I) generation models. This benchmark focuses on measuring the alignment of generated images with real-world knowledge beyond explicit user prompts. ABP consists of over 2,000 prompts covering six scenarios of real-world knowledge. A new metric called ABPScore is introduced, which uses Multimodal Large Language Models to assess alignment with real-world knowledge. The evaluation of 8 T2I models on ABP reveals limitations in integrating real-world knowledge into generated images, even for state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o. An Inference-Time Knowledge Injection (ITKI) strategy is proposed to improve alignment with real-world knowledge, resulting in a significant improvement in ABPScore for challenging samples. The dataset and code for ABP are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have advanced significantly, enabling the creation of high-fidelity images from textual prompts. However, existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on the explicit alignment between generated images and prompts, neglecting the alignment with real-world knowledge beyond prompts. To address this gap, we introduce Align Beyond Prompts (ABP), a comprehensive benchmark designed to measure the alignment of generated images with real-world knowledge that extends beyond the explicit user prompts. ABP comprises over 2,000 meticulously crafted prompts, covering real-world knowledge across six distinct scenarios. We further introduce ABPScore, a metric that utilizes existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to assess the alignment between generated images and world knowledge beyond prompts, which demonstrates strong correlations with human judgments. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular T2I models using ABP, we find that even state-of-the-art models, such as GPT-4o, face limitations in integrating simple real-world knowledge into generated images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a training-free strategy within ABP, named Inference-Time Knowledge Injection (ITKI). By applying this strategy to optimize 200 challenging samples, we achieved an improvement of approximately 43% in ABPScore. The dataset and code are available in https://github.com/smile365317/ABP.

Abstract: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences has emerged as a critical research challenge. While recent advances in this area have extended preference optimization techniques from large language models (LLMs) to the diffusion setting, they often struggle with limited exploration. In this work, we propose a novel and orthogonal approach to enhancing diffusion-based preference optimization. First, we introduce a stable reference model update strategy that relaxes the frozen reference model, encouraging exploration while maintaining a stable optimization anchor through reference model regularization. Second, we present a timestep-aware training strategy that mitigates the reward scale imbalance problem across timesteps. Our method can be integrated into various preference optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods on human preference evaluation benchmarks.

<title>MoMBS: Mixed-order minibatch sampling enhances model training from diverse-quality images</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18741</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural images exhibit label diversity (clean vs. noisy) in noisy-labeled image classification and prevalence diversity (abundant vs. sparse) in long-tailed image classification. Similarly, medical images in universal lesion detection (ULD) exhibit substantial variations in image quality, encompassing attributes such as clarity and label correctness. How to effectively leverage training images with diverse qualities becomes a problem in learning deep models. Conventional training mechanisms, such as self-paced curriculum learning (SCL) and online hard example mining (OHEM), relieve this problem by reweighting images with high loss values. Despite their success, these methods still confront two challenges: (i) the loss-based measure of sample hardness is imprecise, preventing optimum handling of different cases, and (ii) there exists under-utilization in SCL or over-utilization OHEM with the identified hard samples. To address these issues, this paper revisits the minibatch sampling (MBS), a technique widely used in deep network training but largely unexplored concerning the handling of diverse-quality training samples. We discover that the samples within a minibatch influence each other during training; thus, we propose a novel Mixed-order Minibatch Sampling (MoMBS) method to optimize the use of training samples with diverse qualities. MoMBS introduces a measure that takes both loss and uncertainty into account to surpass a sole reliance on loss and allows for a more refined categorization of high-loss samples by distinguishing them as either poorly labeled and under represented or well represented and overfitted. We prioritize under represented samples as the main gradient contributors in a minibatch and keep them from the negative influences of poorly labeled or overfitted samples with a mixed-order minibatch sampling design.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) images reveal detailed information about structures and functions at the subcellular level. However, unlike natural images, IHC datasets pose challenges for deep learning models due to their inconsistencies in channel count and configuration, stemming from varying staining protocols across laboratories and studies. Existing approaches build channel-adaptive models, which unfortunately fail to support out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation across IHC datasets and cannot be applied in a true zero-shot setting with mismatched channel counts. To address this, we introduce a structured view of cellular image channels by grouping them into either context or concept, where we treat the context channels as a reference to the concept channels in the image. We leverage this context-concept principle to develop Channel Conditioned Cell Representations (C3R), a framework designed for unified evaluation on in-distribution (ID) and OOD datasets. C3R is a two-fold framework comprising a channel-adaptive encoder architecture and a masked knowledge distillation training strategy, both built around the context-concept principle. We find that C3R outperforms existing benchmarks on both ID and OOD tasks, while a trivial implementation of our core idea also outperforms the channel-adaptive methods reported on the CHAMMI benchmark. Our method opens a new pathway for cross-dataset generalization between IHC datasets, without requiring dataset-specific adaptation or retraining.

<title>ToDRE: Visual Token Pruning via Diversity and Task Awareness for Efficient Large Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18757</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation of visual inputs of large vision-language models (LVLMs) usually involves substantially more tokens than that of textual inputs, leading to significant computational overhead. Several recent studies strive to mitigate this issue by either conducting token compression to prune redundant visual tokens or guiding them to bypass certain computational stages. While most existing work exploits token importance as the redundancy indicator, our study reveals that two largely neglected factors, namely, the diversity of retained visual tokens and their task relevance, often offer more robust criteria in token pruning. To this end, we design ToDRE, a two-stage and training-free token compression framework that achieves superior performance by pruning Tokens based on token Diversity and token-task RElevance. Instead of pruning redundant tokens, ToDRE introduces a greedy k-center algorithm to select and retain a small subset of diverse visual tokens after the vision encoder. Additionally, ToDRE addresses the "information migration" by further eliminating task-irrelevant visual tokens within the decoder of large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that ToDRE effectively reduces 90% of visual tokens after vision encoder and adaptively prunes all visual tokens within certain LLM's decoder layers, leading to a 2.6x speed-up in total inference time while maintaining 95.1% of model performance and excellent compatibility with efficient attention operators.

<title>StyleGuard: Preventing Text-to-Image-Model-based Style Mimicry Attacks by Style Perturbations</title>

arXiv:2505.18766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have been widely used for style mimicry and personalized customization through methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion. This has raised concerns about intellectual property protection and the generation of deceptive content. Recent studies, such as Glaze and Anti-DreamBooth, have proposed using adversarial noise to protect images from these attacks. However, recent purification-based methods, such as DiffPure and Noise Upscaling, have successfully attacked these latest defenses, showing the vulnerabilities of these methods. Moreover, present methods show limited transferability across models, making them less effective against unknown text-to-image models. To address these issues, we propose a novel anti-mimicry method, StyleGuard. We propose a novel style loss that optimizes the style-related features in the latent space to make it deviate from the original image, which improves model-agnostic transferability. Additionally, to enhance the perturbation's ability to bypass diffusion-based purification, we designed a novel upscale loss that involves ensemble purifiers and upscalers during training. Extensive experiments on the WikiArt and CelebA datasets demonstrate that StyleGuard outperforms existing methods in robustness against various transformations and purifications, effectively countering style mimicry in various models. Moreover, StyleGuard is effective on different style mimicry methods, including DreamBooth and Textual Inversion.

<title>Dual-Path Stable Soft Prompt Generation for Domain Generalization</title>

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model using data from one or multiple related but distinct source domains that can generalize well to unseen out-of-distribution target domains. Inspired by the success of large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), prompt tuning has emerged as an effective generalization strategy. However, it often struggles to capture domain-specific features due to its reliance on manually or fixed prompt inputs. Recently, some prompt generation methods have addressed this limitation by dynamically generating instance-specific and domain-specific prompts for each input, enriching domain information and demonstrating potential for enhanced generalization. Through further investigation, we identify a notable issue in existing prompt generation methods: the same input often yields significantly different and suboptimal prompts across different random seeds, a phenomenon we term Prompt Variability. To address this, we introduce negative learning into the prompt generation process and propose Dual-Path Stable Soft Prompt Generation (DPSPG), a transformer-based framework designed to improve both the stability and generalization of prompts. Specifically, DPSPG incorporates a complementary prompt generator to produce negative prompts, thereby reducing the risk of introducing misleading information. Both theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that negative learning leads to more robust and effective prompts by increasing the effective margin and reducing the upper bound of the gradient norm. Extensive experiments on five DG benchmark datasets show that DPSPG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining prompt stability.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large multimodal models (LMMs), such as the impressive GPT-4o-Native, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in following general-purpose instructions for image generation. However, current benchmarks often lack the necessary breadth and depth to fully evaluate the diverse capabilities of these models. To overcome this limitation, we introduce OmniGenBench, a novel and comprehensive benchmark meticulously designed to assess the instruction-following abilities of state-of-the-art LMMs across both perception-centric and cognition-centric dimensions. Our OmniGenBench includes 57 diverse sub-tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, systematically categorized according to the specific model capabilities they demand. For rigorous evaluation, we further employ a dual-mode protocol. This protocol utilizes off-the-shelf visual parsing tools for perception-centric tasks and a powerful LLM-based judger for cognition-centric tasks to assess the alignment between generated images and user instructions. Using OmniGenBench, we evaluate mainstream generative models, including prevalent models like GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and Seedream, and provide in-depth comparisons and analyses of their performance.Code and data are available at https://github.com/emilia113/OmniGenBench.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) detectors face significant challenges when deployed in real-world environments, particularly when encountering test samples deviated from training data through either postprocessing manipulations or distribution shifts. We demonstrate postprocessing techniques can completely obscure generation artifacts presented in DF samples, leading to performance degradation of DF detectors. To address these challenges, we propose Think Twice before Adaptation (\texttt{T$^2$A}), a novel online test-time adaptation method that enhances the adaptability of detectors during inference without requiring access to source training data or labels. Our key idea is to enable the model to explore alternative options through an Uncertainty-aware Negative Learning objective rather than solely relying on its initial predictions as commonly seen in entropy minimization (EM)-based approaches. We also introduce an Uncertain Sample Prioritization strategy and Gradients Masking technique to improve the adaptation by focusing on important samples and model parameters. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed negative learning objective exhibits complementary behavior to EM, facilitating better adaptation capability. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches and significantly enhances the resilience and generalization of DF detectors during inference.

Abstract: Video Diffusion Transformers (VDiTs) have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality video generation, but remain computationally expensive due to the quadratic complexity of attention over high-dimensional video sequences. Recent attention acceleration methods leverage the sparsity of attention patterns to improve efficiency; however, they often overlook inefficiencies of redundant long-range interactions. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{VORTA}, an acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse attention variants throughout the sampling process. It achieves a $1.76\times$ end-to-end speedup without quality loss on VBench. Furthermore, VORTA can seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as caching and step distillation, reaching up to $14.41\times$ speedup with negligible performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the practicality of VDiTs in real-world settings.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding in videos remains a major challenge for current Video Large Multimodal Models (Video LMMs). Addressing this challenge requires mastering two core capabilities: video referring understanding, which captures the semantics of video regions, and video grounding, which segments object regions based on natural language descriptions. However, most existing approaches tackle these tasks in isolation, limiting progress toward unified, referentially grounded video interaction. We identify a key bottleneck in the lack of high-quality, unified video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating referentially grounded video chat. To address these challenges, we contribute in three core aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce SAMA-239K, a large-scale dataset comprising 15K videos specifically curated to enable joint learning of video referring understanding, grounding, and multi-turn video chat. Second, we propose the SAMA model, which incorporates a versatile spatio-temporal context aggregator and a Segment Anything Model to jointly enhance fine-grained video comprehension and precise grounding capabilities. Finally, we establish SAMA-Bench, a meticulously designed benchmark consisting of 5,067 questions from 522 videos, to comprehensively evaluate the integrated capabilities of Video LMMs in multi-turn, spatio-temporal referring understanding and grounded dialogue. Extensive experiments and benchmarking results show that SAMA not only achieves strong performance on SAMA-Bench but also sets a new state-of-the-art on general grounding benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive performance on standard visual understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) aims to delineate objects based on implicit text queries, the interpretation of which requires reasoning and knowledge integration. Unlike the traditional formulation of segmentation problems that relies on fixed semantic categories or explicit prompting, RS bridges the gap between visual perception and human-like reasoning capabilities, facilitating more intuitive human-AI interaction through natural language. Our work presents the first comprehensive survey of RS for image and video processing, examining 26 state-of-the-art methods together with a review of the corresponding evaluation metrics, as well as 29 datasets and benchmarks. We also explore existing applications of RS across diverse domains and identify their potential extensions. Finally, we identify current research gaps and highlight promising future directions.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP can offer a promising foundation for 3D scene understanding when extended with 3D tokenizers. However, standard approaches, such as k-nearest neighbor or radius-based tokenization, struggle with cross-domain generalization due to sensitivity to dataset-specific spatial scales. We present a universal 3D tokenizer designed for scale-invariant representation learning with a frozen CLIP backbone. We show that combining superpoint-based grouping with coordinate scale normalization consistently outperforms conventional methods through extensive experimental analysis. Specifically, we introduce S4Token, a tokenization pipeline that produces semantically-informed tokens regardless of scene scale. Our tokenizer is trained without annotations using masked point modeling and clustering-based objectives, along with cross-modal distillation to align 3D tokens with 2D multi-view image features. For dense prediction tasks, we propose a superpoint-level feature propagation module to recover point-level detail from sparse tokens.

Abstract: Both CNN-based and Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable success in medical image segmentation tasks. However, CNN-based methods struggle to effectively capture global contextual information due to the inherent limitations of convolution operations. Meanwhile, Transformer-based methods suffer from insufficient local feature modeling and face challenges related to the high computational complexity caused by the self-attention mechanism. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, named MSLAU-Net, which integrates the strengths of both paradigms. The proposed MSLAU-Net incorporates two key ideas. First, it introduces Multi-Scale Linear Attention, designed to efficiently extract multi-scale features from medical images while modeling long-range dependencies with low computational complexity. Second, it adopts a top-down feature aggregation mechanism, which performs multi-level feature aggregation and restores spatial resolution using a lightweight structure. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets covering three imaging modalities demonstrate that the proposed MSLAU-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on nearly all evaluation metrics, validating the superiority, effectiveness, and robustness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/Monsoon49/MSLAU-Net.

Abstract: Understanding how knowledge is distributed across the layers of generative models is crucial for improving interpretability, controllability, and adaptation. While prior work has explored knowledge localization in UNet-based architectures, Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based models remain underexplored in this context. In this paper, we propose a model- and knowledge-agnostic method to localize where specific types of knowledge are encoded within the DiT blocks. We evaluate our method on state-of-the-art DiT-based models, including PixArt-alpha, FLUX, and SANA, across six diverse knowledge categories. We show that the identified blocks are both interpretable and causally linked to the expression of knowledge in generated outputs. Building on these insights, we apply our localization framework to two key applications: model personalization and knowledge unlearning. In both settings, our localized fine-tuning approach enables efficient and targeted updates, reducing computational cost, improving task-specific performance, and better preserving general model behavior with minimal interference to unrelated or surrounding content. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the internal structure of DiTs and introduce a practical pathway for more interpretable, efficient, and controllable model editing.

Abstract: This work investigates the optimal allocation of inference compute across three key scaling factors in video vision language models: language model size, frame count, and the number of visual tokens per frame. While prior works typically focuses on optimizing model efficiency or improving performance without considering resource constraints, we instead identify optimal model configuration under fixed inference compute budgets. We conduct large-scale training sweeps and careful parametric modeling of task performance to identify the inference compute-optimal frontier. Our experiments reveal how task performance depends on scaling factors and finetuning data size, as well as how changes in data size shift the compute-optimal frontier. These findings translate to practical tips for selecting these scaling factors.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, while integral to the evolving digital ecosystem, present a critical challenge: the occlusion of users' eyes and portions of their faces, which hinders visual communication and may contribute to social isolation. To address this, we introduce RevAvatar, an innovative framework that leverages AI methodologies to enable reverse pass-through technology, fundamentally transforming VR headset design and interaction paradigms. RevAvatar integrates state-of-the-art generative models and multimodal AI techniques to reconstruct high-fidelity 2D facial images and generate accurate 3D head avatars from partially observed eye and lower-face regions. This framework represents a significant advancement in AI4Tech by enabling seamless interaction between virtual and physical environments, fostering immersive experiences such as VR meetings and social engagements. Additionally, we present VR-Face, a novel dataset comprising 200,000 samples designed to emulate diverse VR-specific conditions, including occlusions, lighting variations, and distortions. By addressing fundamental limitations in current VR systems, RevAvatar exemplifies the transformative synergy between AI and next-generation technologies, offering a robust platform for enhancing human connection and interaction in virtual environments.

<title>Sparse VideoGen2: Accelerate Video Generation with Sparse Attention via Semantic-Aware Permutation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18875</link>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.

Abstract: Short videos are an effective tool for promoting contents and improving knowledge accessibility. While existing extractive video summarization methods struggle to produce a coherent narrative, existing abstractive methods cannot `quote' from the input videos, i.e., inserting short video clips in their outputs. In this work, we explore novel video editing models for generating shorts that feature a coherent narrative with embedded video insertions extracted from a long input video. We propose a novel retrieval-embedded generation framework that allows a large language model to quote multimodal resources while maintaining a coherent narrative. Our proposed REGen system first generates the output story script with quote placeholders using a finetuned large language model, and then uses a novel retrieval model to replace the quote placeholders by selecting a video clip that best supports the narrative from a pool of candidate quotable video clips. We examine the proposed method on the task of documentary teaser generation, where short interview insertions are commonly used to support the narrative of a documentary. Our objective evaluations show that the proposed method can effectively insert short video clips while maintaining a coherent narrative. In a subjective survey, we show that our proposed method outperforms existing abstractive and extractive approaches in terms of coherence, alignment, and realism in teaser generation.

Abstract: We present the Semantics-aware Dataset and Benchmark Generation Pipeline for Open-vocabulary Object Navigation in Dynamic Scenes (SD-OVON). It utilizes pretraining multimodal foundation models to generate infinite unique photo-realistic scene variants that adhere to real-world semantics and daily commonsense for the training and the evaluation of navigation agents, accompanied with a plugin for generating object navigation task episodes compatible to the Habitat simulator. In addition, we offer two pre-generated object navigation task datasets, SD-OVON-3k and SD-OVON-10k, comprising respectively about 3k and 10k episodes of the open-vocabulary object navigation task, derived from the SD-OVON-Scenes dataset with 2.5k photo-realistic scans of real-world environments and the SD-OVON-Objects dataset with 0.9k manually inspected scanned and artist-created manipulatable object models. Unlike prior datasets limited to static environments, SD-OVON covers dynamic scenes and manipulatable objects, facilitating both real-to-sim and sim-to-real robotic applications. This approach enhances the realism of navigation tasks, the training and the evaluation of open-vocabulary object navigation agents in complex settings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and datasets, we propose two baselines and evaluate them along with state-of-the-art baselines on SD-OVON-3k. The datasets, benchmark and source code are publicly available.

<title>Beyond Domain Randomization: Event-Inspired Perception for Visually Robust Adversarial Imitation from Videos</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18899</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18899</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation from videos often fails when expert demonstrations and learner environments exhibit domain shifts, such as discrepancies in lighting, color, or texture. While visual randomization partially addresses this problem by augmenting training data, it remains computationally intensive and inherently reactive, struggling with unseen scenarios. We propose a different approach: instead of randomizing appearances, we eliminate their influence entirely by rethinking the sensory representation itself. Inspired by biological vision systems that prioritize temporal transients (e.g., retinal ganglion cells) and by recent sensor advancements, we introduce event-inspired perception for visually robust imitation. Our method converts standard RGB videos into a sparse, event-based representation that encodes temporal intensity gradients, discarding static appearance features. This biologically grounded approach disentangles motion dynamics from visual style, enabling robust visual imitation from observations even in the presence of visual mismatches between expert and agent environments. By training policies on event streams, we achieve invariance to appearance-based distractors without requiring computationally expensive and environment-specific data augmentation techniques. Experiments across the DeepMind Control Suite and the Adroit platform for dynamic dexterous manipulation show the efficacy of our method. Our code is publicly available at Eb-LAIfO.

arXiv:2505.18915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in various 2D visual tasks, yet their readiness for 3D clinical diagnosis remains unclear due to stringent demands for recognition precision, reasoning ability, and domain knowledge. To systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets, with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition, Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin, CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules significantly affect 3D perception. To facilitate medical multimodal research, we have released DeepTumorVQA as a rigorous benchmark: https://github.com/Schuture/DeepTumorVQA.

<title>LLM-Guided Taxonomy and Hierarchical Uncertainty for 3D Point CLoud Active Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel active learning framework for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation that, for the first time, integrates large language models (LLMs) to construct hierarchical label structures and guide uncertainty-based sample selection. Unlike prior methods that treat labels as flat and independent, our approach leverages LLM prompting to automatically generate multi-level semantic taxonomies and introduces a recursive uncertainty projection mechanism that propagates uncertainty across hierarchy levels. This enables spatially diverse, label-aware point selection that respects the inherent semantic structure of 3D scenes. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 show that our method achieves up to 4% mIoU improvement under extremely low annotation budgets (e.g., 0.02%), substantially outperforming existing baselines. Our results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs as knowledge priors in 3D vision and establish hierarchical uncertainty modeling as a powerful paradigm for efficient point cloud annotation.

<title>Words as Geometric Features: Estimating Homography using Optical Character Recognition as Compressed Image Representation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document alignment and registration play a crucial role in numerous real-world applications, such as automated form processing, anomaly detection, and workflow automation. Traditional methods for document alignment rely on image-based features like keypoints, edges, and textures to estimate geometric transformations, such as homographies. However, these approaches often require access to the original document images, which may not always be available due to privacy, storage, or transmission constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) outputs as features for homography estimation. By utilizing the spatial positions and textual content of OCR-detected words, our method enables document alignment without relying on pixel-level image data. This technique is particularly valuable in scenarios where only OCR outputs are accessible. Furthermore, the method is robust to OCR noise, incorporating RANSAC to handle outliers and inaccuracies in the OCR data. On a set of test documents, we demonstrate that our OCR-based approach even performs more accurately than traditional image-based methods, offering a more efficient and scalable solution for document registration tasks. The proposed method facilitates applications in document processing, all while reducing reliance on high-dimensional image data.

<title>WeedNet: A Foundation Model-Based Global-to-Local AI Approach for Real-Time Weed Species Identification and Classification</title>

arXiv:2505.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early identification of weeds is essential for effective management and control, and there is growing interest in automating the process using computer vision techniques coupled with AI methods. However, challenges associated with training AI-based weed identification models, such as limited expert-verified data and complexity and variability in morphological features, have hindered progress. To address these issues, we present WeedNet, the first global-scale weed identification model capable of recognizing an extensive set of weed species, including noxious and invasive plant species. WeedNet is an end-to-end real-time weed identification pipeline and uses self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, and enhanced trustworthiness strategies. WeedNet achieved 91.02% accuracy across 1,593 weed species, with 41% species achieving 100% accuracy. Using a fine-tuning strategy and a Global-to-Local approach, the local Iowa WeedNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.38% for 85 Iowa weeds, most classes exceeded a 90% mean accuracy per class. Testing across intra-species dissimilarity (developmental stages) and inter-species similarity (look-alike species) suggests that diversity in the images collected, spanning all the growth stages and distinguishable plant characteristics, is crucial in driving model performance. The generalizability and adaptability of the Global WeedNet model enable it to function as a foundational model, with the Global-to-Local strategy allowing fine-tuning for region-specific weed communities. Additional validation of drone- and ground-rover-based images highlights the potential of WeedNet for integration into robotic platforms. Furthermore, integration with AI for conversational use provides intelligent agricultural and ecological conservation consulting tools for farmers, agronomists, researchers, land managers, and government agencies across diverse landscapes.

<title>Geometry-guided Online 3D Video Synthesis with Multi-View Temporal Consistency</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel geometry-guided online video view synthesis method with enhanced view and temporal consistency. Traditional approaches achieve high-quality synthesis from dense multi-view camera setups but require significant computational resources. In contrast, selective-input methods reduce this cost but often compromise quality, leading to multi-view and temporal inconsistencies such as flickering artifacts. Our method addresses this challenge to deliver efficient, high-quality novel-view synthesis with view and temporal consistency. The key innovation of our approach lies in using global geometry to guide an image-based rendering pipeline. To accomplish this, we progressively refine depth maps using color difference masks across time. These depth maps are then accumulated through truncated signed distance fields in the synthesized view's image space. This depth representation is view and temporally consistent, and is used to guide a pre-trained blending network that fuses multiple forward-rendered input-view images. Thus, the network is encouraged to output geometrically consistent synthesis results across multiple views and time. Our approach achieves consistent, high-quality video synthesis, while running efficiently in an online manner.

<title>Echo Planning for Autonomous Driving: From Current Observations to Future Trajectories and Back</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2 error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners. Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Understanding and synthesizing realistic 3D hand-object interactions (HOI) is critical for applications ranging from immersive AR/VR to dexterous robotics. Existing methods struggle with generalization, performing well on closed-set objects and predefined tasks but failing to handle unseen objects or open-vocabulary instructions. We introduce OpenHOI, the first framework for open-world HOI synthesis, capable of generating long-horizon manipulation sequences for novel objects guided by free-form language commands. Our approach integrates a 3D Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) fine-tuned for joint affordance grounding and semantic task decomposition, enabling precise localization of interaction regions (e.g., handles, buttons) and breakdown of complex instructions (e.g., "Find a water bottle and take a sip") into executable sub-tasks. To synthesize physically plausible interactions, we propose an affordance-driven diffusion model paired with a training-free physics refinement stage that minimizes penetration and optimizes affordance alignment. Evaluations across diverse scenarios demonstrate OpenHOI's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to novel object categories, multi-stage tasks, and complex language instructions.

<title>How Do Images Align and Complement LiDAR? Towards a Harmonized Multi-modal 3D Panoptic Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18956</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D panoptic segmentation often struggles with the inherent sparsity of data from LiDAR sensors, which makes it challenging to accurately recognize distant or small objects. Recently, a few studies have sought to overcome this challenge by integrating LiDAR inputs with camera images, leveraging the rich and dense texture information provided by the latter. While these approaches have shown promising results, they still face challenges, such as misalignment during data augmentation and the reliance on post-processing steps. To address these issues, we propose Image-Assists-LiDAR (IAL), a novel multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation framework. In IAL, we first introduce a modality-synchronized data augmentation strategy, PieAug, to ensure alignment between LiDAR and image inputs from the start. Next, we adopt a transformer decoder to directly predict panoptic segmentation results. To effectively fuse LiDAR and image features into tokens for the decoder, we design a Geometric-guided Token Fusion (GTF) module. Additionally, we leverage the complementary strengths of each modality as priors for query initialization through a Prior-based Query Generation (PQG) module, enhancing the decoder's ability to generate accurate instance masks. Our IAL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation methods on two widely used benchmarks. Code and models are publicly available at .

arXiv:2505.18958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most publicly available medical segmentation datasets are only partially labeled, with annotations provided for a subset of anatomical structures. When multiple datasets are combined for training, this incomplete annotation poses challenges, as it limits the model's ability to learn shared anatomical representations among datasets. Furthermore, vision-only frameworks often fail to capture complex anatomical relationships and task-specific distinctions, leading to reduced segmentation accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen datasets. In this study, we proposed a novel CLIP-DINO Prompt-Driven Segmentation Network (CDPDNet), which combined a self-supervised vision transformer with CLIP-based text embedding and introduced task-specific text prompts to tackle these challenges. Specifically, the framework was constructed upon a convolutional neural network (CNN) and incorporated DINOv2 to extract both fine-grained and global visual features, which were then fused using a multi-head cross-attention module to overcome the limited long-range modeling capability of CNNs. In addition, CLIP-derived text embeddings were projected into the visual space to help model complex relationships among organs and tumors. To further address the partial label challenge and enhance inter-task discriminative capability, a Text-based Task Prompt Generation (TTPG) module that generated task-specific prompts was designed to guide the segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrated that CDPDNet consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Code and pretrained model are available at: https://github.com/wujiong-hub/CDPDNet.git.

arXiv:2505.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as an effective strategy, significantly reducing training costs and facilitating more efficient model deployment. Recent advances have leveraged generative models to distill datasets by capturing the underlying data distribution. Unfortunately, existing methods require model fine-tuning with distillation losses to encourage diversity and representativeness. However, these methods do not guarantee sample diversity, limiting their performance. We propose a mode-guided diffusion model leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model without the need to fine-tune with distillation losses. Our approach addresses dataset diversity in three stages: Mode Discovery to identify distinct data modes, Mode Guidance to enhance intra-class diversity, and Stop Guidance to mitigate artifacts in synthetic samples that affect performance. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy gains of 4.4%, 2.9%, 1.6%, and 1.6% on ImageNette, ImageIDC, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K, respectively. Our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning diffusion models with distillation losses, significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Current perception models have achieved remarkable success by leveraging large-scale labeled datasets, but still face challenges in open-world environments with novel objects. To address this limitation, researchers introduce open-set perception models to detect or segment arbitrary test-time user-input categories. However, open-set models rely on human involvement to provide predefined object categories as input during inference. More recently, researchers have framed a more realistic and challenging task known as open-ended perception that aims to discover unseen objects without requiring any category-level input from humans at inference time. Nevertheless, open-ended models suffer from low performance compared to open-set models. In this paper, we present VL-SAM-V2, an open-world object detection framework that is capable of discovering unseen objects while achieving favorable performance. To achieve this, we combine queries from open-set and open-ended models and propose a general and specific query fusion module to allow different queries to interact. By adjusting queries from open-set models, we enable VL-SAM-V2 to be evaluated in the open-set or open-ended mode. In addition, to learn more diverse queries, we introduce ranked learnable queries to match queries with proposals from open-ended models by sorting. Moreover, we design a denoising point training strategy to facilitate the training process. Experimental results on LVIS show that our method surpasses the previous open-set and open-ended methods, especially on rare objects.

Abstract: Accurate tumour segmentation is vital for various targeted diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for cancer, e.g., planning biopsies or tumour ablations. Manual delineation is extremely labour-intensive, requiring substantial expert time. Fully-supervised machine learning models aim to automate such localisation tasks, but require a large number of costly and often subjective 3D voxel-level labels for training. The high-variance and subjectivity in such labels impacts model generalisability, even when large datasets are available. Histopathology labels may offer more objective labels but the infeasibility of acquiring pixel-level annotations to develop tumour localisation methods based on histology remains challenging in-vivo. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework called SPARS (Self-Play Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Segmentation), which utilises an object presence classifier, trained on a small number of image-level binary cancer presence labels, to localise cancerous regions on CT scans. Such binary labels of patient-level cancer presence can be sourced more feasibly from biopsies and histopathology reports, enabling a more objective cancer localisation on medical images. Evaluating with real patient data, we observed that SPARS yielded a mean dice score of $77.3 \pm 9.4$, which outperformed other weakly-supervised methods by large margins. This performance was comparable with recent fully-supervised methods that require voxel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate the potential of using SPARS to reduce the need for extensive human-annotated labels to detect cancer in real-world healthcare settings.

Abstract: Pansharpening is a fundamental task in remote sensing that integrates high-resolution panchromatic imagery (PAN) with low-resolution multispectral imagery (LRMS) to produce an enhanced image with both high spatial and spectral resolution. Despite significant progress in deep learning-based approaches, existing methods often fail to capture the global priors inherent in remote sensing data distributions. Diffusion-based models have recently emerged as promising solutions due to their powerful distribution mapping capabilities; however, they suffer from significant inference latency, which limits their practical applicability. In this work, we propose the Kernel Space Diffusion Model (KSDiff), a novel approach that leverages diffusion processes in a latent space to generate convolutional kernels enriched with global contextual information, thereby improving pansharpening quality while enabling faster inference. Specifically, KSDiff constructs these kernels through the integration of a low-rank core tensor generator and a unified factor generator, orchestrated by a structure-aware multi-head attention mechanism. We further introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for pansharpening, enabling KSDiff to serve as a framework for enhancing existing pansharpening architectures. Experiments on three widely used datasets, including WorldView-3, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superior performance of KSDiff both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code will be released upon possible acceptance.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently shown promising results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM methods are all constrained to small-room scenarios and struggle with memory explosion in large-scale scenes and long sequences. To this end, we propose VPGS-SLAM, the first 3DGS-based large-scale RGBD SLAM framework for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. We design a novel voxel-based progressive 3D Gaussian mapping method with multiple submaps for compact and accurate scene representation in large-scale and long-sequence scenes. This allows us to scale up to arbitrary scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In addition, we propose a 2D-3D fusion camera tracking method to achieve robust and accurate camera tracking in both indoor and outdoor large-scale scenes. Furthermore, we design a 2D-3D Gaussian loop closure method to eliminate pose drift. We further propose a submap fusion method with online distillation to achieve global consistency in large-scale scenes when detecting a loop. Experiments on various indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the proposed framework. The code will be open source on https://github.com/dtc111111/vpgs-slam.

<title>Co-AttenDWG: Co-Attentive Dimension-Wise Gating and Expert Fusion for Multi-Modal Offensive Content Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19010</link>

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has become a critical research area because integrating text and image data can significantly improve performance in tasks such as classification, retrieval, and scene understanding. However, despite progress with pre-trained models, current approaches are limited by inadequate cross-modal interactions and static fusion strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary nature of different modalities. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel multi-modal Co-AttenDWG architecture that leverages dual-path encoding, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and advanced expert fusion. Our approach begins by projecting text and image features into a common embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention mechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities. This mechanism is further enhanced by a dimension-wise gating network that adaptively regulates the feature contributions at the channel level, ensuring that only the most relevant information is emphasized. In parallel, dual-path encoders refine the representations by processing cross-modal information separately before an additional cross-attention layer further aligns modalities. The refined features are then aggregated via an expert fusion module that combines learned gating and self-attention to produce a robust, unified representation. We validate our approach on the MIMIC and SemEval Memotion 1.0, where experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in cross-modal alignment and state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the potential of our model for a wide range of multi-modal applications.

Abstract: Spatial relation reasoning is a crucial task for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand the objective world. However, current benchmarks have issues like relying on bounding boxes, ignoring perspective substitutions, or allowing questions to be answered using only the model's prior knowledge without image understanding. To address these issues, we introduce SpatialMQA, a human-annotated spatial relation reasoning benchmark based on COCO2017, which enables MLLMs to focus more on understanding images in the objective world. To ensure data quality, we design a well-tailored annotation procedure, resulting in SpatialMQA consisting of 5,392 samples. Based on this benchmark, a series of closed- and open-source MLLMs are implemented and the results indicate that the current state-of-the-art MLLM achieves only 48.14% accuracy, far below the human-level accuracy of 98.40%. Extensive experimental analyses are also conducted, suggesting the future research directions. The benchmark and codes are available at https://github.com/ziyan-xiaoyu/SpatialMQA.git.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.

Abstract: Monkeypox is a viral disease characterized by distinctive skin lesions and has been reported in many countries. The recent global outbreak has emphasized the urgent need for scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic solutions to support public health responses.
  In this study, we developed ITMAINN, an intelligent, AI-driven healthcare system specifically designed to detect Monkeypox from skin lesion images using advanced deep learning techniques. Our system consists of three main components. First, we trained and evaluated several pretrained models using transfer learning on publicly available skin lesion datasets to identify the most effective models. For binary classification (Monkeypox vs. non-Monkeypox), the Vision Transformer, MobileViT, Transformer-in-Transformer, and VGG16 achieved the highest performance, each with an accuracy and F1-score of 97.8%. For multiclass classification, which contains images of patients with Monkeypox and five other classes (chickenpox, measles, hand-foot-mouth disease, cowpox, and healthy), ResNetViT and ViT Hybrid models achieved 92% accuracy, with F1 scores of 92.24% and 92.19%, respectively. The best-performing and most lightweight model, MobileViT, was deployed within the mobile application. The second component is a cross-platform smartphone application that enables users to detect Monkeypox through image analysis, track symptoms, and receive recommendations for nearby healthcare centers based on their location. The third component is a real-time monitoring dashboard designed for health authorities to support them in tracking cases, analyzing symptom trends, guiding public health interventions, and taking proactive measures.
  This system is fundamental in developing responsive healthcare infrastructure within smart cities. Our solution, ITMAINN, is part of revolutionizing public health management.

arXiv:2505.19028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding infographic charts with design-driven visual elements (e.g., pictograms, icons) requires both visual recognition and reasoning, posing challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing visual-question answering benchmarks fall short in evaluating these capabilities of MLLMs due to the lack of paired plain charts and visual-element-based questions. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes 5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying data but differing in visual presentations. We further design visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new opportunities for advancing MLLMs in infographic chart understanding. We release InfoChartQA at https://github.com/CoolDawnAnt/InfoChartQA.

Abstract: Medical large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance across various single-image question answering (QA) benchmarks, yet their capability in processing multi-image clinical scenarios remains underexplored. Unlike single image based tasks, medical tasks involving multiple images often demand sophisticated visual understanding capabilities, such as temporal reasoning and cross-modal analysis, which are poorly supported by current medical LVLMs. To bridge this critical gap, we present the Med-MIM instruction dataset, comprising 83.2K medical multi-image QA pairs that span four types of multi-image visual abilities (temporal understanding, reasoning, comparison, co-reference). Using this dataset, we fine-tune Mantis and LLaVA-Med, resulting in two specialized medical VLMs: MIM-LLaVA-Med and Med-Mantis, both optimized for multi-image analysis. Additionally, we develop the Med-MIM benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the medical multi-image understanding capabilities of LVLMs. We assess eight popular LVLMs, including our two models, on the Med-MIM benchmark. Experimental results show that both Med-Mantis and MIM-LLaVA-Med achieve superior performance on the held-in and held-out subsets of the Med-MIM benchmark, demonstrating that the Med-MIM instruction dataset effectively enhances LVLMs' multi-image understanding capabilities in the medical domain.

Abstract: In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the learning of 3D human representation. However, the complexity of lots of hand-defined human body constraints and the absence of supervision data limit that the existing works controllably and accurately represent the human body in views of semantics and representation ability. In this paper, we propose a human body representation with controllable fine-grained semantics and high precison of reconstruction in an unsupervised learning framework. In particularly, we design a whole-aware skeleton-grouped disentangle strategy to learn a correspondence between geometric semantical measurement of body and latent codes, which facilitates the control of shape and posture of human body by modifying latent coding paramerers. With the help of skeleton-grouped whole-aware encoder and unsupervised disentanglement losses, our representation model is learned by an unsupervised manner. Besides, a based-template residual learning scheme is injected into the encoder to ease of learning human body latent parameter in complicated body shape and pose spaces. Because of the geometrically meaningful latent codes, it can be used in a wide range of applications, from human body pose transfer to bilinear latent code interpolation. Further more, a part-aware decoder is utlized to promote the learning of controllable fine-grained semantics. The experimental results on public 3D human datasets show that the method has the ability of precise reconstruction.

<title>Less is More: Efficient Point Cloud Reconstruction via Multi-Head Decoders</title>

arXiv:2505.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We challenge the common assumption that deeper decoder architectures always yield better performance in point cloud reconstruction. Our analysis reveals that, beyond a certain depth, increasing decoder complexity leads to overfitting and degraded generalization. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-head decoder architecture that exploits the inherent redundancy in point clouds by reconstructing complete shapes from multiple independent heads, each operating on a distinct subset of points. The final output is obtained by concatenating the predictions from all heads, enhancing both diversity and fidelity. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart demonstrate that our approach achieves consistent improvements across key metrics--including Chamfer Distance (CD), Hausdorff Distance (HD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and F1-score--outperforming standard single-head baselines. Our findings highlight that output diversity and architectural design can be more critical than depth alone for effective and efficient point cloud reconstruction.

Abstract: Although diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities, existing methods for stylized image generation based on these models often require textual inversion or fine-tuning with style images, which is time-consuming and limits the practical applicability of large-scale diffusion models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel stylized image generation method leveraging a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model without requiring fine-tuning or any additional optimization, termed as OmniPainter. Specifically, we exploit the self-consistency property of latent consistency models to extract the representative style statistics from reference style images to guide the stylization process. Additionally, we then introduce the norm mixture of self-attention, which enables the model to query the most relevant style patterns from these statistics for the intermediate output content features. This mechanism also ensures that the stylized results align closely with the distribution of the reference style images. Our qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Macro photography (MP) is a specialized field of photography that captures objects at an extremely close range, revealing tiny details. Although an accurate macro photography image quality assessment (MPIQA) metric can benefit macro photograph capturing, which is vital in some domains such as scientific research and medical applications, the lack of MPIQA data limits the development of MPIQA metrics. To address this limitation, we conducted a large-scale MPIQA study. Specifically, to ensure diversity both in content and quality, we sampled 2,000 MP images from 15,700 MP images, collected from three public image websites. For each MP image, 17 (out of 21 after outlier removal) quality ratings and a detailed quality report of distortion magnitudes, types, and positions are gathered by a lab study. The images, quality ratings, and quality reports form our novel multi-labeled MPIQA database, MMP-2k. Experimental results showed that the state-of-the-art generic IQA metrics underperform on MP images. The database and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/Future-IQA/MMP-2k.

Abstract: Charts are high-density visualization carriers for complex data, serving as a crucial medium for information extraction and analysis. Automated chart understanding poses significant challenges to existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning. Current step-by-step reasoning models primarily focus on text-based logical reasoning for chart understanding. However, they struggle to refine or correct their reasoning when errors stem from flawed visual understanding, as they lack the ability to leverage multimodal interaction for deeper comprehension. Inspired by human cognitive behavior, we propose ChartSketcher, a multimodal feedback-driven step-by-step reasoning method designed to address these limitations. ChartSketcher is a chart understanding model that employs Sketch-CoT, enabling MLLMs to annotate intermediate reasoning steps directly onto charts using a programmatic sketching library, iteratively feeding these visual annotations back into the reasoning process. This mechanism enables the model to visually ground its reasoning and refine its understanding over multiple steps. We employ a two-stage training strategy: a cold start phase to learn sketch-based reasoning patterns, followed by off-policy reinforcement learning to enhance reflection and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that ChartSketcher achieves promising performance on chart understanding benchmarks and general vision tasks, providing an interactive and interpretable approach to chart comprehension.

Abstract: Face swapping, recognized as a privacy and security concern, has prompted considerable defensive research. With the advancements in AI-generated content, the discrepancies between the real and swapped faces have become nuanced. Considering the difficulty of forged traces detection, we shift the focus to the face swapping purpose and proactively embed elaborate watermarks against unknown face swapping techniques. Given that the constant purpose is to swap the original face identity while preserving the background, we concentrate on the regions surrounding the face to ensure robust watermark generation, while embedding the contour texture and face identity information to achieve progressive image determination. The watermark is located in the facial contour and contains hybrid messages, dubbed the contour-hybrid watermark (CMark). Our approach generalizes face swapping detection without requiring any swapping techniques during training and the storage of large-scale messages in advance. Experiments conducted across 8 face swapping techniques demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with state-of-the-art passive and proactive detectors while achieving a favorable balance between the image quality and watermark robustness.

Abstract: Visual generation and understanding are two deeply interconnected aspects of human intelligence, yet they have been traditionally treated as separate tasks in machine learning. In this paper, we propose Jodi, a diffusion framework that unifies visual generation and understanding by jointly modeling the image domain and multiple label domains. Specifically, Jodi is built upon a linear diffusion transformer along with a role switch mechanism, which enables it to perform three particular types of tasks: (1) joint generation, where the model simultaneously generates images and multiple labels; (2) controllable generation, where images are generated conditioned on any combination of labels; and (3) image perception, where multiple labels can be predicted at once from a given image. Furthermore, we present the Joint-1.6M dataset, which contains 200,000 high-quality images collected from public sources, automatic labels for 7 visual domains, and LLM-generated captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jodi excels in both generation and understanding tasks and exhibits strong extensibility to a wider range of visual domains.

<title>Plug-and-Play Context Feature Reuse for Efficient Masked Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked generative models (MGMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for image synthesis, combining parallel decoding with strong bidirectional context modeling. However, generating high-quality samples typically requires many iterative decoding steps, resulting in high inference costs. A straightforward way to speed up generation is by decoding more tokens in each step, thereby reducing the total number of steps. However, when many tokens are decoded simultaneously, the model can only estimate the univariate marginal distributions independently, failing to capture the dependency among them. As a result, reducing the number of steps significantly compromises generation fidelity. In this work, we introduce ReCAP (Reused Context-Aware Prediction), a plug-and-play module that accelerates inference in MGMs by constructing low-cost steps via reusing feature embeddings from previously decoded context tokens. ReCAP interleaves standard full evaluations with lightweight steps that cache and reuse context features, substantially reducing computation while preserving the benefits of fine-grained, iterative generation. We demonstrate its effectiveness on top of three representative MGMs (MaskGIT, MAGE, and MAR), including both discrete and continuous token spaces and covering diverse architectural designs. In particular, on ImageNet256 class-conditional generation, ReCAP achieves up to 2.4x faster inference than the base model with minimal performance drop, and consistently delivers better efficiency-fidelity trade-offs under various generation settings.

<title>SATORI-R1: Incentivizing Multimodal Reasoning with Spatial Grounding and Verifiable Rewards</title>

arXiv:2505.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities in the text domain through stable reinforcement learning (RL). Recently, in the multimodal domain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form reasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks share an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely on the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1) Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions, degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI ($\textbf{S}patially$ $\textbf{A}nchored$ $\textbf{T}ask$ $\textbf{O}ptimization$ with $\textbf{R}e\textbf{I}nforcement$ Learning), which decomposes VQA into three verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to $15.7\%$ improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions, which brings improvements in accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/justairr/SATORI-R1.

Abstract: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography offers detailed insights into the structural connectivity of the brain, but presents challenges in effective representation and interpretation in deep learning models. In this work, we propose a novel 2D representation of DTI tractography that encodes tract-level fractional anisotropy (FA) values into a 9x9 grayscale image. This representation is processed through a Beta-Total Correlation Variational Autoencoder with a Spatial Broadcast Decoder to learn a disentangled and interpretable latent embedding. We evaluate the quality of this embedding using supervised and unsupervised representation learning strategies, including auxiliary classification, triplet loss, and SimCLR-based contrastive learning. Compared to the 1D Group deep neural network (DNN) baselines, our approach improves the F1 score in a downstream sex classification task by 15.74% and shows a better disentanglement than the 3D representation.

arXiv:2505.19111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the large number of parameters in existing remote sensing image classification models, which hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices, this paper proposes a lightweight classification method based on knowledge distillation. Specifically, G-GhostNet is adopted as the backbone network, leveraging feature reuse to reduce redundant parameters and significantly improve inference efficiency. In addition, a decoupled knowledge distillation strategy is employed, which separates target and non-target classes to effectively enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results on the RSOD and AID datasets demonstrate that, compared with the high-parameter VGG-16 model, the proposed method achieves nearly equivalent Top-1 accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by 6.24 times. This approach strikes an excellent balance between model size and classification performance, offering an efficient solution for deployment on resource-limited devices.

Abstract: Graphic design plays a vital role in visual communication across advertising, marketing, and multimedia entertainment. Prior work has explored automated graphic design generation using diffusion models, aiming to streamline creative workflows and democratize design capabilities. However, complex graphic design scenarios require accurately adhering to design intent specified by multiple heterogeneous user-provided elements (\eg images, layouts, and texts), which pose multi-condition control challenges for existing methods. Specifically, previous single-condition control models demonstrate effectiveness only within their specialized domains but fail to generalize to other conditions, while existing multi-condition methods often lack fine-grained control over each sub-condition and compromise overall compositional harmony. To address these limitations, we introduce CreatiDesign, a systematic solution for automated graphic design covering both model architecture and dataset construction. First, we design a unified multi-condition driven architecture that enables flexible and precise integration of heterogeneous design elements with minimal architectural modifications to the base diffusion model. Furthermore, to ensure that each condition precisely controls its designated image region and to avoid interference between conditions, we propose a multimodal attention mask mechanism. Additionally, we develop a fully automated pipeline for constructing graphic design datasets, and introduce a new dataset with 400K samples featuring multi-condition annotations, along with a comprehensive benchmark. Experimental results show that CreatiDesign outperforms existing models by a clear margin in faithfully adhering to user intent.

<title>Freqformer: Image-Demoir\'eing Transformer via Efficient Frequency Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Image demoir\'eing remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay between texture corruption and color distortions caused by moir\'e patterns. Existing methods, especially those relying on direct image-to-image restoration, often fail to disentangle these intertwined artifacts effectively. While wavelet-based frequency-aware approaches offer a promising direction, their potential remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Freqformer, a Transformer-based framework specifically designed for image demoir\'eing through targeted frequency separation. Our method performs an effective frequency decomposition that explicitly splits moir\'e patterns into high-frequency spatially-localized textures and low-frequency scale-robust color distortions, which are then handled by a dual-branch architecture tailored to their distinct characteristics. We further propose a learnable Frequency Composition Transform (FCT) module to adaptively fuse the frequency-specific outputs, enabling consistent and high-fidelity reconstruction. To better aggregate the spatial dependencies and the inter-channel complementary information, we introduce a Spatial-Aware Channel Attention (SA-CA) module that refines moir\'e-sensitive regions without incurring high computational cost. Extensive experiments on various demoir\'eing benchmarks demonstrate that Freqformer achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact model size. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/Freqformer.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, but remain challenging to train due to their inherent stochasticity, where high-variance gradient estimates lead to slow convergence. Previous works have shown that magnitude preservation helps with stabilizing training in the U-net architecture. This work explores whether this effect extends to the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. As such, we propose a magnitude-preserving design that stabilizes training without normalization layers. Motivated by the goal of maintaining activation magnitudes, we additionally introduce rotation modulation, which is a novel conditioning method using learned rotations instead of traditional scaling or shifting. Through empirical evaluations and ablation studies on small-scale models, we show that magnitude-preserving strategies significantly improve performance, notably reducing FID scores by $\sim$12.8%. Further, we show that rotation modulation combined with scaling is competitive with AdaLN, while requiring $\sim$5.4% fewer parameters. This work provides insights into conditioning strategies and magnitude control. We will publicly release the implementation of our method.

Abstract: Understanding accurate atomic temporal event is essential for video comprehension. However, current video-language benchmarks often fall short to evaluate Large Multi-modal Models' (LMMs) temporal event understanding capabilities, as they can be effectively addressed using image-language models. In this paper, we introduce RTime-QA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess the atomic temporal event understanding ability of LMMs. RTime-QA comprises 822 high-quality, carefully-curated video-text questions, each meticulously annotated by human experts. Each question features a video depicting an atomic temporal event, paired with both correct answers and temporal negative descriptions, specifically designed to evaluate temporal understanding. To advance LMMs' temporal event understanding ability, we further introduce RTime-IT, a 14k instruction-tuning dataset that employs a similar annotation process as RTime-QA. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates that RTime-QA presents a significant challenge for LMMs: the state-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL achieves only 34.6 on strict-ACC metric, substantially lagging behind human performance. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that RTime-IT effectively enhance LMMs' capacity in temporal understanding. By fine-tuning on RTime-IT, our Qwen2-VL achieves 65.9 on RTime-QA.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based on Thermal Infrared (TIR) imaging has gained attention in novel-view synthesis, showing real-time rendering. However, novel-view synthesis with thermal infrared images suffers from transmission effects, emissivity, and low resolution, leading to floaters and blur effects in rendered images. To address these problems, we introduce Veta-GS, which leverages a view-dependent deformation field and a Thermal Feature Extractor (TFE) to precisely capture subtle thermal variations and maintain robustness. Specifically, we design view-dependent deformation field that leverages camera position and viewing direction, which capture thermal variations. Furthermore, we introduce the Thermal Feature Extractor (TFE) and MonoSSIM loss, which consider appearance, edge, and frequency to maintain robustness. Extensive experiments on the TI-NSD benchmark show that our method achieves better performance over existing methods.

<title>The Eye of Sherlock Holmes: Uncovering User Private Attribute Profiling via Vision-Language Model Agentic Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19139</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19139</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our research reveals a new privacy risk associated with the vision-language model (VLM) agentic framework: the ability to infer sensitive attributes (e.g., age and health information) and even abstract ones (e.g., personality and social traits) from a set of personal images, which we term "image private attribute profiling." This threat is particularly severe given that modern apps can easily access users' photo albums, and inference from image sets enables models to exploit inter-image relations for more sophisticated profiling. However, two main challenges hinder our understanding of how well VLMs can profile an individual from a few personal photos: (1) the lack of benchmark datasets with multi-image annotations for private attributes, and (2) the limited ability of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to infer abstract attributes from large image collections. In this work, we construct PAPI, the largest dataset for studying private attribute profiling in personal images, comprising 2,510 images from 251 individuals with 3,012 annotated privacy attributes. We also propose HolmesEye, a hybrid agentic framework that combines VLMs and LLMs to enhance privacy inference. HolmesEye uses VLMs to extract both intra-image and inter-image information and LLMs to guide the inference process as well as consolidate the results through forensic analysis, overcoming existing limitations in long-context visual reasoning. Experiments reveal that HolmesEye achieves a 10.8% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines and surpasses human-level performance by 15.0% in predicting abstract attributes. This work highlights the urgency of addressing privacy risks in image-based profiling and offers both a new dataset and an advanced framework to guide future research in this area.

<title>DISTA-Net: Dynamic Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target Unmixing</title>

Abstract: Resolving closely-spaced small targets in dense clusters presents a significant challenge in infrared imaging, as the overlapping signals hinder precise determination of their quantity, sub-pixel positions, and radiation intensities. While deep learning has advanced the field of infrared small target detection, its application to closely-spaced infrared small targets has not yet been explored. This gap exists primarily due to the complexity of separating superimposed characteristics and the lack of an open-source infrastructure. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Network (DISTA-Net), which reconceptualizes traditional sparse reconstruction within a dynamic framework. DISTA-Net adaptively generates convolution weights and thresholding parameters to tailor the reconstruction process in real time. To the best of our knowledge, DISTA-Net is the first deep learning model designed specifically for the unmixing of closely-spaced infrared small targets, achieving superior sub-pixel detection accuracy. Moreover, we have established the first open-source ecosystem to foster further research in this field. This ecosystem comprises three key components: (1) CSIST-100K, a publicly available benchmark dataset; (2) CSO-mAP, a custom evaluation metric for sub-pixel detection; and (3) GrokCSO, an open-source toolkit featuring DISTA-Net and other models. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/GrokCV/GrokCSO.

arXiv:2505.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated image editing techniques, driving increasing demand for diverse and fine-grained edits. Despite these advances, existing image editing methods still face challenges in achieving high precision and semantic accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent studies address this issue by incorporating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into image editing pipelines. However, current MLLM-based methods mainly rely on interpreting textual instructions, leaving the intrinsic visual understanding of large models largely unexplored, thus resulting in insufficient alignment between textual semantics and visual outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose MIND-Edit, an end-to-end image-editing framework integrating pretrained diffusion model with MLLM. MIND-Edit introduces two complementary strategies: (1) a text instruction optimization strategy that clarifies ambiguous user instructions based on semantic reasoning from the MLLM, and (2) an MLLM insight-driven editing strategy that explicitly leverages the intrinsic visual understanding capability of the MLLM to infer editing intent and guide the diffusion process via generated visual embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a joint training approach to effectively integrate both strategies, allowing them to reinforce each other for more accurate instruction interpretation and visually coherent edits aligned with user intent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIND-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly under complex and challenging scenarios.

arXiv:2505.19154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene understanding based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently achieved notable advances. Although 3DGS related methods have efficient rendering capabilities, they fail to address the inherent contradiction between the anisotropic color representation of gaussian primitives and the isotropic requirements of semantic features, leading to insufficient cross-view feature consistency. To overcome the limitation, we proposes $\textit{FHGS}$ (Feature-Homogenized Gaussian Splatting), a novel 3D feature fusion framework inspired by physical models, which can achieve high-precision mapping of arbitrary 2D features from pre-trained models to 3D scenes while preserving the real-time rendering efficiency of 3DGS. Specifically, our $\textit{FHGS}$ introduces the following innovations: Firstly, a universal feature fusion architecture is proposed, enabling robust embedding of large-scale pre-trained models' semantic features (e.g., SAM, CLIP) into sparse 3D structures. Secondly, a non-differentiable feature fusion mechanism is introduced, which enables semantic features to exhibit viewpoint independent isotropic distributions. This fundamentally balances the anisotropic rendering of gaussian primitives and the isotropic expression of features; Thirdly, a dual-driven optimization strategy inspired by electric potential fields is proposed, which combines external supervision from semantic feature fields with internal primitive clustering guidance. This mechanism enables synergistic optimization of global semantic alignment and local structural consistency. More interactive results can be accessed on: https://fhgs.cuastro.org/.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the auto-regressive nature of current video large language models (Video-LLMs), the inference latency increases as the input sequence length grows, posing challenges for the efficient processing of video sequences that are usually very long. We observe that during decoding, the attention scores of most tokens in Video-LLMs tend to be sparse and concentrated, with only certain tokens requiring comprehensive full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce Sparse-to-Dense (StD), a novel decoding strategy that integrates two distinct modules: one leveraging sparse top-K attention and the other employing dense full attention. These modules collaborate to accelerate Video-LLMs without loss. The fast (sparse) model speculatively decodes multiple tokens, while the slow (dense) model verifies them in parallel. StD is a tuning-free, plug-and-play solution that achieves up to a 1.94$\times$ walltime speedup in video processing. It maintains model performance while enabling a seamless transition from a standard Video-LLM to a sparse Video-LLM with minimal code modifications.

<title>A Joint Learning Framework with Feature Reconstruction and Prediction for Incomplete Satellite Image Time Series in Agricultural Semantic Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19159</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is crucial for agricultural semantic segmentation. However, Cloud contamination introduces time gaps in SITS, disrupting temporal dependencies and causing feature shifts, leading to degraded performance of models trained on complete SITS. Existing methods typically address this by reconstructing the entire SITS before prediction or using data augmentation to simulate missing data. Yet, full reconstruction may introduce noise and redundancy, while the data-augmented model can only handle limited missing patterns, leading to poor generalization. We propose a joint learning framework with feature reconstruction and prediction to address incomplete SITS more effectively. During training, we simulate data-missing scenarios using temporal masks. The two tasks are guided by both ground-truth labels and the teacher model trained on complete SITS. The prediction task constrains the model from selectively reconstructing critical features from masked inputs that align with the teacher's temporal feature representations. It reduces unnecessary reconstruction and limits noise propagation. By integrating reconstructed features into the prediction task, the model avoids learning shortcuts and maintains its ability to handle varied missing patterns and complete SITS. Experiments on SITS from Hunan Province, Western France, and Catalonia show that our method improves mean F1-scores by 6.93% in cropland extraction and 7.09% in crop classification over baselines. It also generalizes well across satellite sensors, including Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope, under varying temporal missing rates and model backbones.

Abstract: In laparoscopic surgery, a clear and high-quality visual field is critical for surgeons to make accurate intraoperative decisions. However, persistent visual degradation, including smoke generated by energy devices, lens fogging from thermal gradients, and lens contamination due to blood or tissue fluid splashes during surgical procedures, severely impair visual clarity. These degenerations can seriously hinder surgical workflow and pose risks to patient safety. To systematically investigate and address various forms of surgical scene degradation, we introduce a real-world open-source surgical image restoration dataset covering laparoscopic environments, called SurgClean, which involves multi-type image restoration tasks, e.g., desmoking, defogging, and desplashing. SurgClean comprises 1,020 images with diverse degradation types and corresponding paired reference labels. Based on SurgClean, we establish a standardized evaluation benchmark and provide performance for 22 representative generic task-specific image restoration approaches, including 12 generic and 10 task-specific image restoration approaches. Experimental results reveal substantial performance gaps relative to clinical requirements, highlighting a critical opportunity for algorithm advancements in intelligent surgical restoration. Furthermore, we explore the degradation discrepancies between surgical and natural scenes from structural perception and semantic understanding perspectives, providing fundamental insights for domain-specific image restoration research. Our work aims to empower the capabilities of restoration algorithms to increase surgical environments and improve the efficiency of clinical procedures.

Abstract: We introduce JEDI, a test-time adaptation method that enhances subject separation and compositional alignment in diffusion models without requiring retraining or external supervision. JEDI operates by minimizing semantic entanglement in attention maps using a novel Jensen-Shannon divergence based objective.

  JEDI is model-agnostic and applicable to architectures such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 and 3.5, consistently improving prompt alignment and disentanglement in complex scenes. Additionally, JEDI provides a lightweight, CLIP-free disentanglement score derived from internal attention distributions, offering a principled benchmark for compositional alignment under test-time conditions.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D hand mesh is challenging but an important task for human-computer interaction and AR/VR applications. In particular, RGB and/or depth cameras have been widely used in this task. However, methods using these conventional cameras face challenges in low-light environments and during motion blur. Thus, to address these limitations, event cameras have been attracting attention in recent years for their high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. Despite their advantages, event cameras are sensitive to background noise or camera motion, which has limited existing studies to static backgrounds and fixed cameras. In this study, we propose EventEgoHands, a novel method for event-based 3D hand mesh reconstruction in an egocentric view. Our approach introduces a Hand Segmentation Module that extracts hand regions, effectively mitigating the influence of dynamic background events. We evaluated our approach and demonstrated its effectiveness on the N-HOT3D dataset, improving MPJPE by approximately more than 4.5 cm (43%).

Abstract: The field of computer graphics was revolutionized by models such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, displacing triangles as the dominant representation for photogrammetry. In this paper, we argue for a triangle comeback. We develop a differentiable renderer that directly optimizes triangles via end-to-end gradients. We achieve this by rendering each triangle as differentiable splats, combining the efficiency of triangles with the adaptive density of representations based on independent primitives. Compared to popular 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, our approach achieves higher visual fidelity, faster convergence, and increased rendering throughput. On the Mip-NeRF360 dataset, our method outperforms concurrent non-volumetric primitives in visual fidelity and achieves higher perceptual quality than the state-of-the-art Zip-NeRF on indoor scenes. Triangles are simple, compatible with standard graphics stacks and GPU hardware, and highly efficient: for the \textit{Garden} scene, we achieve over 2,400 FPS at 1280x720 resolution using an off-the-shelf mesh renderer. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of triangle-based representations for high-quality novel view synthesis. Triangles bring us closer to mesh-based optimization by combining classical computer graphics with modern differentiable rendering frameworks. The project page is https://trianglesplatting.github.io/

Abstract: Understanding the emotional impact of videos is crucial for applications in content creation, advertising, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Traditional affective computing methods rely on self-reported emotions, facial expression analysis, and biosensing data, yet they often overlook the role of visual saliency -- the naturally attention-grabbing regions within a video. In this study, we utilize deep learning to introduce a novel saliency-based approach to emotion prediction by extracting two key features: saliency area and number of salient regions. Using the HD2S saliency model and OpenFace facial action unit analysis, we examine the relationship between video saliency and viewer emotions. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) Videos with multiple salient regions tend to elicit high-valence, low-arousal emotions, (2) Videos with a single dominant salient region are more likely to induce low-valence, high-arousal responses, and (3) Self-reported emotions often misalign with facial expression-based emotion detection, suggesting limitations in subjective reporting. By leveraging saliency-driven insights, this work provides a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative for emotion modeling, with implications for content creation, personalized media experiences, and affective computing research.

Abstract: Automated pose correction remains a significant challenge in AI-driven fitness systems, despite extensive research in activity recognition. This work presents PosePilot, a novel system that integrates pose recognition with real-time personalized corrective feedback, overcoming the limitations of traditional fitness solutions. Using Yoga, a discipline requiring precise spatio-temporal alignment as a case study, we demonstrate PosePilot's ability to analyze complex physical movements. Designed for deployment on edge devices, PosePilot can be extended to various at-home and outdoor exercises. We employ a Vanilla LSTM, allowing the system to capture temporal dependencies for pose recognition. Additionally, a BiLSTM with multi-head Attention enhances the model's ability to process motion contexts, selectively focusing on key limb angles for accurate error detection while maintaining computational efficiency. As part of this work, we introduce a high-quality video dataset used for evaluating our models. Most importantly, PosePilot provides instant corrective feedback at every stage of a movement, ensuring precise posture adjustments throughout the exercise routine. The proposed approach 1) performs automatic human posture recognition, 2) provides personalized posture correction feedback at each instant which is crucial in Yoga, and 3) offers a lightweight and robust posture correction model feasible for deploying on edge devices in real-world environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model fine-tuning leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to align generated images with learnable reward functions. The existing approaches reformulate denoising as a Markov decision process for RL-driven optimization. However, they suffer from reward sparsity, receiving only a single delayed reward per generated trajectory. This flaw hinders precise step-level attribution of denoising actions, undermines training efficiency. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective credit assignment framework that dynamically distributes dense rewards across denoising steps. Specifically, we track changes in cosine similarity between intermediate and final images to quantify each step's contribution on progressively reducing the distance to the final image. Our approach avoids additional auxiliary neural networks for step-level preference modeling and instead uses reward shaping to highlight denoising phases that have a greater impact on image quality. Our method achieves 1.25 to 2 times higher sample efficiency and better generalization across four human preference reward functions, without compromising the original optimal policy.

Abstract: Segmentation is one of the most important tasks in the medical imaging pipeline as it influences a number of image-based decisions. To be effective, fully supervised segmentation approaches require large amounts of manually annotated training data. However, the pixel-level annotation process is expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, hindering progress and making it challenging to perform effective segmentations. Therefore, models must learn efficiently from limited labeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL), particularly contrastive learning via pre-training on unlabeled data and fine-tuning on limited annotations, can facilitate such limited labeled image segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised contrastive learning framework for medical image segmentation, leveraging inherent relationships of different images, dubbed PolyCL. Without requiring any pixel-level annotations or unreasonable data augmentations, our PolyCL learns and transfers context-aware discriminant features useful for segmentation from an innovative surrogate, in a task-related manner. Additionally, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our framework in two novel ways: as a post-processing refinement module that improves the accuracy of predicted masks using bounding box prompts derived from coarse outputs, and as a propagation mechanism via SAM 2 that generates volumetric segmentations from a single annotated 2D slice. Experimental evaluations on three public computed tomography (CT) datasets demonstrate that PolyCL outperforms fully-supervised and self-supervised baselines in both low-data and cross-domain scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/tbwa233/PolyCL.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a core technique powering state-of-the-art image generation systems, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we begin by analyzing CFG in a simplified linear diffusion model, where we show its behavior closely resembles that observed in the nonlinear case. Our analysis reveals that linear CFG improves generation quality via three distinct components: (i) a mean-shift term that approximately steers samples in the direction of class means, (ii) a positive Contrastive Principal Components (CPC) term that amplifies class-specific features, and (iii) a negative CPC term that suppresses generic features prevalent in unconditional data. We then verify that these insights in real-world, nonlinear diffusion models: over a broad range of noise levels, linear CFG resembles the behavior of its nonlinear counterpart. Although the two eventually diverge at low noise levels, we discuss how the insights from the linear analysis still shed light on the CFG's mechanism in the nonlinear regime.

Abstract: In the past decade, image foundation models (IFMs) have achieved unprecedented progress. However, the potential of directly using IFMs for video self-supervised representation learning has largely been overlooked. In this study, we propose an advancing video self-supervised learning (AdViSe) approach, aimed at significantly reducing the training overhead of video representation models using pre-trained IFMs. Specifically, we first introduce temporal modeling modules (ResNet3D) to IFMs, constructing a video representation model. We then employ a video self-supervised learning approach, playback rate perception, to train temporal modules while freezing the IFM components. Experiments on UCF101 demonstrate that AdViSe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing training time by $3.4\times$ and GPU memory usage by $8.2\times$. This study offers fresh insights into low-cost video self-supervised learning based on pre-trained IFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/JingwWu/advise-video-ssl.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive. However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores, introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of perceptual realness assessment.

Abstract: Data-driven learning has advanced autonomous driving, yet task-specific models struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios due to their narrow optimization objectives and reliance on costly annotated data. We present DriveX, a self-supervised world model that learns generalizable scene dynamics and holistic representations (geometric, semantic, and motion) from large-scale driving videos. DriveX introduces Omni Scene Modeling (OSM), a module that unifies multimodal supervision-3D point cloud forecasting, 2D semantic representation, and image generation-to capture comprehensive scene evolution. To simplify learning complex dynamics, we propose a decoupled latent world modeling strategy that separates world representation learning from future state decoding, augmented by dynamic-aware ray sampling to enhance motion modeling. For downstream adaptation, we design Future Spatial Attention (FSA), a unified paradigm that dynamically aggregates spatiotemporal features from DriveX's predictions to enhance task-specific inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate DriveX's effectiveness: it achieves significant improvements in 3D future point cloud prediction over prior work, while attaining state-of-the-art results on diverse tasks including occupancy prediction, flow estimation, and end-to-end driving. These results validate DriveX's capability as a general-purpose world model, paving the way for robust and unified autonomous driving frameworks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, aimed at partitioning an image into semantically meaningful regions. Referring image segmentation extends this task by using natural language expressions to localize specific objects, requiring effective integration of visual and linguistic information. In this work, we propose SegVLM, a vision-language model that incorporates architectural improvements to enhance segmentation accuracy and cross-modal alignment. The model integrates squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks for dynamic feature recalibration, deformable convolutions for geometric adaptability, and residual connections for deep feature learning. We also introduce a novel referring-aware fusion (RAF) loss that balances region-level alignment, boundary precision, and class imbalance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that each component contributes to consistent performance improvements. SegVLM also shows strong generalization across diverse datasets and referring expression scenarios.

<title>PolyPose: Localizing Deformable Anatomy in 3D from Sparse 2D X-ray Images using Polyrigid Transforms</title>

arXiv:2505.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-ray images, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.

<title>Enhancing Text-to-Image Diffusion Transformer via Split-Text Conditioning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion generation typically employs complete-text conditioning. Due to the intricate syntax, diffusion transformers (DiTs) inherently suffer from a comprehension defect of complete-text captions. One-fly complete-text input either overlooks critical semantic details or causes semantic confusion by simultaneously modeling diverse semantic primitive types. To mitigate this defect of DiTs, we propose a novel split-text conditioning framework named DiT-ST. This framework converts a complete-text caption into a split-text caption, a collection of simplified sentences, to explicitly express various semantic primitives and their interconnections. The split-text caption is then injected into different denoising stages of DiT-ST in a hierarchical and incremental manner. Specifically, DiT-ST leverages Large Language Models to parse captions, extracting diverse primitives and hierarchically sorting out and constructing these primitives into a split-text input. Moreover, we partition the diffusion denoising process according to its differential sensitivities to diverse semantic primitive types and determine the appropriate timesteps to incrementally inject tokens of diverse semantic primitive types into input tokens via cross-attention. In this way, DiT-ST enhances the representation learning of specific semantic primitive types across different stages. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed DiT-ST in mitigating the complete-text comprehension defect.

<title>Improving Novel view synthesis of 360$^\circ$ Scenes in Extremely Sparse Views by Jointly Training Hemisphere Sampled Synthetic Images</title>

Abstract: Novel view synthesis in 360$^\circ$ scenes from extremely sparse input views is essential for applications like virtual reality and augmented reality. This paper presents a novel framework for novel view synthesis in extremely sparse-view cases. As typical structure-from-motion methods are unable to estimate camera poses in extremely sparse-view cases, we apply DUSt3R to estimate camera poses and generate a dense point cloud. Using the poses of estimated cameras, we densely sample additional views from the upper hemisphere space of the scenes, from which we render synthetic images together with the point cloud. Training 3D Gaussian Splatting model on a combination of reference images from sparse views and densely sampled synthetic images allows a larger scene coverage in 3D space, addressing the overfitting challenge due to the limited input in sparse-view cases. Retraining a diffusion-based image enhancement model on our created dataset, we further improve the quality of the point-cloud-rendered images by removing artifacts. We compare our framework with benchmark methods in cases of only four input views, demonstrating significant improvement in novel view synthesis under extremely sparse-view conditions for 360$^\circ$ scenes.

Abstract: Text-embedded image generation plays a critical role in industries such as graphic design, advertising, and digital content creation. Text-to-Image generation methods leveraging diffusion models, such as TextDiffuser-2, have demonstrated promising results in producing images with embedded text. TextDiffuser-2 effectively generates bounding box layouts that guide the rendering of visual text, achieving high fidelity and coherence. However, existing approaches often rely on resource-intensive processes and are limited in their ability to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for rapid and optimized text layout generation with a diffusion-based image synthesis model. Our RL-based approach significantly accelerates the bounding box prediction step while reducing overlaps, allowing the system to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Our approach has been evaluated on the MARIOEval benchmark, achieving OCR and CLIPScore metrics close to state-of-the-art models, while being 97.64% more faster and requiring only 2MB of memory to run.

Abstract: Pre-training equips text-to-image (T2I) models with broad world knowledge, but this alone is often insufficient to achieve high aesthetic quality and alignment. Consequently, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for further refinement. However, its effectiveness highly depends on the quality of the fine-tuning dataset. Existing public SFT datasets frequently target narrow domains (e.g., anime or specific art styles), and the creation of high-quality, general-purpose SFT datasets remains a significant challenge. Current curation methods are often costly and struggle to identify truly impactful samples. This challenge is further complicated by the scarcity of public general-purpose datasets, as leading models often rely on large, proprietary, and poorly documented internal data, hindering broader research progress. This paper introduces a novel methodology for creating general-purpose SFT datasets by leveraging a pre-trained generative model as an estimator of high-impact training samples. We apply this methodology to construct and release Alchemist, a compact (3,350 samples) yet highly effective SFT dataset. Experiments demonstrate that Alchemist substantially improves the generative quality of five public T2I models while preserving diversity and style. Additionally, we release the fine-tuned models' weights to the public.

<title>Holistic White-light Polyp Classification via Alignment-free Dense Distillation of Auxiliary Optical Chromoendoscopy</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19319</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are the two main colonoscopic modalities for polyp classification. While NBI, as optical chromoendoscopy, offers valuable vascular details, WLI remains the most common and often the only available modality in resource-limited settings. However, WLI-based methods typically underperform, limiting their clinical applicability. Existing approaches transfer knowledge from NBI to WLI through global feature alignment but often rely on cropped lesion regions, which are susceptible to detection errors and neglect contextual and subtle diagnostic cues. To address this, this paper proposes a novel holistic classification framework that leverages full-image diagnosis without requiring polyp localization. The key innovation lies in the Alignment-free Dense Distillation (ADD) module, which enables fine-grained cross-domain knowledge distillation regardless of misalignment between WLI and NBI images. Without resorting to explicit image alignment, ADD learns pixel-wise cross-domain affinities to establish correspondences between feature maps, guiding the distillation along the most relevant pixel connections. To further enhance distillation reliability, ADD incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to filter cross-domain affinities, ensuring the distillation path connects only those semantically consistent regions with equal contributions to polyp diagnosis. Extensive results on public and in-house datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, relatively outperforming the other approaches by at least 2.5% and 16.2% in AUC, respectively. Code is available at: https://github.com/Huster-Hq/ADD.

<title>BAH Dataset for Ambivalence/Hesitancy Recognition in Videos for Behavioural Change</title>

Abstract: Recognizing complex emotions linked to ambivalence and hesitancy (A/H) can play a critical role in the personalization and effectiveness of digital behaviour change interventions. These subtle and conflicting emotions are manifested by a discord between multiple modalities, such as facial and vocal expressions, and body language. Although experts can be trained to identify A/H, integrating them into digital interventions is costly and less effective. Automatic learning systems provide a cost-effective alternative that can adapt to individual users, and operate seamlessly within real-time, and resource-limited environments. However, there are currently no datasets available for the design of ML models to recognize A/H. This paper introduces a first Behavioural Ambivalence/Hesitancy (BAH) dataset collected for subject-based multimodal recognition of A/H in videos. It contains videos from 224 participants captured across 9 provinces in Canada, with different age, and ethnicity. Through our web platform, we recruited participants to answer 7 questions, some of which were designed to elicit A/H while recording themselves via webcam with microphone. BAH amounts to 1,118 videos for a total duration of 8.26 hours with 1.5 hours of A/H. Our behavioural team annotated timestamp segments to indicate where A/H occurs, and provide frame- and video-level annotations with the A/H cues. Video transcripts and their timestamps are also included, along with cropped and aligned faces in each frame, and a variety of participants meta-data. We include results baselines for BAH at frame- and video-level recognition in multi-modal setups, in addition to zero-shot prediction, and for personalization using unsupervised domain adaptation. The limited performance of baseline models highlights the challenges of recognizing A/H in real-world videos. The data, code, and pretrained weights are available.

Abstract: Current text-driven image editing methods typically follow one of two directions: relying on large-scale, high-quality editing pair datasets to improve editing precision and diversity, or exploring alternative dataset-free techniques. However, constructing large-scale editing datasets requires carefully designed pipelines, is time-consuming, and often results in unrealistic samples or unwanted artifacts. Meanwhile, dataset-free methods may suffer from limited instruction comprehension and restricted editing capabilities. Faced with these challenges, the present work develops a novel paradigm for instruction-driven image editing that leverages widely available and enormous text-image pairs, instead of relying on editing pair datasets. Our approach introduces a multi-scale learnable region to localize and guide the editing process. By treating the alignment between images and their textual descriptions as supervision and learning to generate task-specific editing regions, our method achieves high-fidelity, precise, and instruction-consistent image editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach attains state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and benchmarks, while exhibiting strong adaptability to various types of generative models.

arXiv:2505.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting vision-language models such as CLIP to downstream tasks. However, existing methods often overfit to seen data, leading to significant performance degradation when generalizing to novel classes or unseen domains. To address this limitation, we propose DiSa, a Directional Saliency-Aware Prompt Learning framework that integrates two complementary regularization strategies to enhance generalization. First, our Cross-Interactive Regularization (CIR) fosters cross-modal alignment by enabling cooperative learning between prompted and frozen encoders. Within CIR, a saliency-aware masking strategy guides the image encoder to prioritize semantically critical image regions, reducing reliance on less informative patches. Second, we introduce a directional regularization strategy that aligns visual embeddings with class-wise prototype features in a directional manner to prioritize consistency in feature orientation over strict proximity. This approach ensures robust generalization by leveraging stable prototype directions derived from class-mean statistics. Extensive evaluations on 11 diverse image classification benchmarks demonstrate that DiSa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, domain generalization, and few-shot learning.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-motion generation models rely on the kinematic-aware, local-relative motion representation popularized by HumanML3D, which encodes motion relative to the pelvis and to the previous frame with built-in redundancy. While this design simplifies training for earlier generation models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and hinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion representation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned alternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global space. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this formulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text alignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and no auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally supports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and temporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and costly classifier guidance generation from control signals. Finally, we demonstrate promising generalization to directly generate SMPL-H mesh vertices in motion from text, laying a strong foundation for future research and motion-related applications.

Abstract: Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) often faces significant challenges due to missing angular information. Unlike previous methods that operate in the image domain, we propose a new method that focuses on sinogram inpainting. We leverage MR-SDEs, a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion process with mean-reverting stochastic differential equations, to fill in missing angular data at the projection level. Furthermore, by combining distillation with constraining the output of the model using the pseudo-inverse of the inpainting matrix, the diffusion process is accelerated and done in a step, enabling efficient and accurate sinogram completion. A subsequent post-processing module back-projects the inpainted sinogram into the image domain and further refines the reconstruction, effectively suppressing artifacts while preserving critical structural details. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual and fidelity quality, offering a promising solution for LACT reconstruction in scientific and clinical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have sparked interest in world models capable of simulating realistic environments. While navigation has been well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric. We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100 GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism, bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions. We release all datasets, code, weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse visual content from natural language prompts. However, uncontrolled reproduction of sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful imagery poses serious ethical, legal, and safety challenges. To address these concerns, the concept erasure paradigm has emerged as a promising direction, enabling the selective removal of specific semantic concepts from generative models while preserving their overall utility. This survey provides a comprehensive overview and in-depth synthesis of concept erasure techniques in T2I diffusion models. We systematically categorize existing approaches along three key dimensions: intervention level, which identifies specific model components targeted for concept removal; optimization structure, referring to the algorithmic strategies employed to achieve suppression; and semantic scope, concerning the complexity and nature of the concepts addressed. This multi-dimensional taxonomy enables clear, structured comparisons across diverse methodologies, highlighting fundamental trade-offs between erasure specificity, generalization, and computational complexity. We further discuss current evaluation benchmarks, standardized metrics, and practical datasets, emphasizing gaps that limit comprehensive assessment, particularly regarding robustness and practical effectiveness. Finally, we outline major challenges and promising future directions, including disentanglement of concept representations, adaptive and incremental erasure strategies, adversarial robustness, and new generative architectures. This survey aims to guide researchers toward safer, more ethically aligned generative models, providing foundational knowledge and actionable recommendations to advance responsible development in generative AI.

Abstract: Recent multimodal image generators such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at following complex instructions, editing images and maintaining concept consistency. However, they are still evaluated by disjoint toolkits: text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks that lacks multi-modal conditioning, and customized image generation benchmarks that overlook compositional semantics and common knowledge. We propose MMIG-Bench, a comprehensive Multi-Modal Image Generation Benchmark that unifies these tasks by pairing 4,850 richly annotated text prompts with 1,750 multi-view reference images across 380 subjects, spanning humans, animals, objects, and artistic styles. MMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level metrics for visual artifacts and identity preservation of objects; (2) novel Aspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers fine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human judgments; and (3) high-level metrics for aesthetics and human preference. Using MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, FLUX, DreamBooth, and IP-Adapter, and validate our metrics with 32k human ratings, yielding in-depth insights into architecture and data design. We will release the dataset and evaluation code to foster rigorous, unified evaluation and accelerate future innovations in multi-modal image generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods have demonstrated exceptional localization precision and remarkable dense mapping performance. However, dynamic objects introduce critical challenges by disrupting scene consistency, leading to tracking drift and mapping artifacts. Existing methods that employ semantic segmentation or object detection for dynamic identification and filtering typically rely on predefined categorical priors, while discarding dynamic scene information crucial for robotic applications such as dynamic obstacle avoidance and environmental interaction. To overcome these challenges, we propose ADD-SLAM: an Adaptive Dynamic Dense SLAM framework based on Gaussian splitting. We design an adaptive dynamic identification mechanism grounded in scene consistency analysis, comparing geometric and textural discrepancies between real-time observations and historical maps. Ours requires no predefined semantic category priors and adaptively discovers scene dynamics. Precise dynamic object recognition effectively mitigates interference from moving targets during localization. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic-static separation mapping strategy that constructs a temporal Gaussian model to achieve online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate our method's flexible and accurate dynamic segmentation capabilities, along with state-of-the-art performance in both localization and mapping.

<title>Certainty and Uncertainty Guided Active Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) adapts models to target domains by selectively labeling a few target samples. Existing ADA methods prioritize uncertain samples but overlook confident ones, which often match ground-truth. We find that incorporating confident predictions into the labeled set before active sampling reduces the search space and improves adaptation. To address this, we propose a collaborative framework that labels uncertain samples while treating highly confident predictions as ground truth. Our method combines Gaussian Process-based Active Sampling (GPAS) for identifying uncertain samples and Pseudo-Label-based Certain Sampling (PLCS) for confident ones, progressively enhancing adaptation. PLCS refines the search space, and GPAS reduces the domain gap, boosting the proportion of confident samples. Extensive experiments on Office-Home and DomainNet show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art ADA methods.

<title>LlamaSeg: Image Segmentation via Autoregressive Mask Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LlamaSeg, a visual autoregressive framework that unifies multiple image segmentation tasks via natural language instructions. We reformulate image segmentation as a visual generation problem, representing masks as "visual" tokens and employing a LLaMA-style Transformer to predict them directly from image inputs. By adhering to the next-token prediction paradigm, our approach naturally integrates segmentation tasks into autoregressive architectures. To support large-scale training, we introduce a data annotation pipeline and construct the SA-OVRS dataset, which contains 2M segmentation masks annotated with over 5,800 open-vocabulary labels or diverse textual descriptions, covering a wide spectrum of real-world scenarios. This enables our model to localize objects in images based on text prompts and to generate fine-grained masks. To more accurately evaluate the quality of masks produced by visual generative models, we further propose a composite metric that combines Intersection over Union (IoU) with Average Hausdorff Distance (AHD), offering a more precise assessment of contour fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing generative models across multiple datasets and yields more detailed segmentation masks.

<title>Structure Disruption: Subverting Malicious Diffusion-Based Inpainting via Self-Attention Query Perturbation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19425</link>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enhanced their image inpainting and editing capabilities but also introduced significant societal risks. Adversaries can exploit user images from social media to generate misleading or harmful content. While adversarial perturbations can disrupt inpainting, global perturbation-based methods fail in mask-guided editing tasks due to spatial constraints. To address these challenges, we propose Structure Disruption Attack (SDA), a powerful protection framework for safeguarding sensitive image regions against inpainting-based editing. Building upon the contour-focused nature of self-attention mechanisms of diffusion models, SDA optimizes perturbations by disrupting queries in self-attention during the initial denoising step to destroy the contour generation process. This targeted interference directly disrupts the structural generation capability of diffusion models, effectively preventing them from producing coherent images. We validate our motivation through visualization techniques and extensive experiments on public datasets, demonstrating that SDA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) protection performance while maintaining strong robustness.

<title>CSTrack: Enhancing RGB-X Tracking via Compact Spatiotemporal Features</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19434</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively modeling and utilizing spatiotemporal features from RGB and other modalities (\eg, depth, thermal, and event data, denoted as X) is the core of RGB-X tracker design. Existing methods often employ two parallel branches to separately process the RGB and X input streams, requiring the model to simultaneously handle two dispersed feature spaces, which complicates both the model structure and computation process. More critically, intra-modality spatial modeling within each dispersed space incurs substantial computational overhead, limiting resources for inter-modality spatial modeling and temporal modeling. To address this, we propose a novel tracker, CSTrack, which focuses on modeling Compact Spatiotemporal features to achieve simple yet effective tracking. Specifically, we first introduce an innovative Spatial Compact Module that integrates the RGB-X dual input streams into a compact spatial feature, enabling thorough intra- and inter-modality spatial modeling. Additionally, we design an efficient Temporal Compact Module that compactly represents temporal features by constructing the refined target distribution heatmap. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our compact spatiotemporal modeling method, with CSTrack achieving new SOTA results on mainstream RGB-X benchmarks. The code and models will be released at: https://github.com/XiaokunFeng/CSTrack.

<title>MM-Prompt: Cross-Modal Prompt Tuning for Continual Visual Question Answering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Visual Question Answering (CVQA) based on pre-trained models(PTMs) has achieved promising progress by leveraging prompt tuning to enable continual multi-modal learning. However, most existing methods adopt cross-modal prompt isolation, constructing visual and textual prompts separately, which exacerbates modality imbalance and leads to degraded performance over time. To tackle this issue, we propose MM-Prompt, a novel framework incorporating cross-modal prompt query and cross-modal prompt recovery. The former enables balanced prompt selection by incorporating cross-modal signals during query formation, while the latter promotes joint prompt reconstruction through iterative cross-modal interactions, guided by an alignment loss to prevent representational drift. Extensive experiments show that MM-Prompt surpasses prior approaches in accuracy and knowledge retention, while maintaining balanced modality engagement throughout continual learning.

<title>Revolutionizing Wildfire Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks: A VGG16 Model Approach</title>

Abstract: Over 8,024 wildfire incidents have been documented in 2024 alone, affecting thousands of fatalities and significant damage to infrastructure and ecosystems. Wildfires in the United States have inflicted devastating losses. Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense, which highlights how urgently efficient warning systems are needed to avoid disastrous outcomes. The goal of this study is to enhance the accuracy of wildfire detection by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on the VGG16 architecture. The D-FIRE dataset, which includes several kinds of wildfire and non-wildfire images, was employed in the study. Low-resolution images, dataset imbalance, and the necessity for real-time applicability are some of the main challenges. These problems were resolved by enriching the dataset using data augmentation techniques and optimizing the VGG16 model for binary classification. The model produced a low false negative rate, which is essential for reducing unexplored fires, despite dataset boundaries. In order to help authorities execute fast responses, this work shows that deep learning models such as VGG16 can offer a reliable, automated approach for early wildfire recognition. For the purpose of reducing the impact of wildfires, our future work will concentrate on connecting to systems with real-time surveillance networks and enlarging the dataset to cover more varied fire situations.

Abstract: Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with stereo depth estimation in rapidly changing scenes. In contrast, bio-inspired spike cameras emit asynchronous events at microsecond-level resolution, providing an alternative sensing modality. However, existing methods lack specialized stereo algorithms and benchmarks tailored to the spike data. To address this gap, we propose SpikeStereoNet, a brain-inspired framework and the first to estimate stereo depth directly from raw spike streams. The model fuses raw spike streams from two viewpoints and iteratively refines depth estimation through a recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) update module. To benchmark our approach, we introduce a large-scale synthetic spike stream dataset and a real-world stereo spike dataset with dense depth annotations. SpikeStereoNet outperforms existing methods on both datasets by leveraging spike streams' ability to capture subtle edges and intensity shifts in challenging regions such as textureless surfaces and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, our framework exhibits strong data efficiency, maintaining high accuracy even with substantially reduced training data. The source code and datasets will be publicly available.

Abstract: 3D vector graphics play a crucial role in various applications including 3D shape retrieval, conceptual design, and virtual reality interactions due to their ability to capture essential structural information with minimal representation. While recent approaches have shown promise in generating 3D vector graphics, they often suffer from lengthy processing times and struggle to maintain view consistency. To address these limitations, we propose ViewCraft3D (VC3D), an efficient method that leverages 3D priors to generate 3D vector graphics. Specifically, our approach begins with 3D object analysis, employs a geometric extraction algorithm to fit 3D vector graphics to the underlying structure, and applies view-consistent refinement process to enhance visual quality. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VC3D outperforms previous methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while significantly reducing computational overhead. The resulting 3D sketches maintain view consistency and effectively capture the essential characteristics of the original objects.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video action understanding tasks in real-world scenarios always suffer data limitations. In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot action recognition.

<title>Enhancing Visual Reliance in Text Generation: A Bayesian Perspective on Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19498</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19498</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually generate texts which satisfy context coherence but don't match the visual input. Such a hallucination issue hinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving hallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual content. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a specific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in LVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the visual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based on our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three aspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in generating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual tokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate prior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words. We propose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian perspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the posterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to a prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at all. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME demonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue of LVLM and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

<title>Objective, Absolute and Hue-aware Metrics for Intrinsic Image Decomposition on Real-World Scenes: A Proof of Concept</title>

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is the task of separating an image into albedo and shade. In real-world scenes, it is difficult to quantitatively assess IID quality due to the unavailability of ground truth. The existing method provides the relative reflection intensities based on human-judged annotations. However, these annotations have challenges in subjectivity, relative evaluation, and hue non-assessment. To address these, we propose a concept of quantitative evaluation with a calculated albedo from a hyperspectral imaging and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) intensity. Additionally, we introduce an optional albedo densification approach based on spectral similarity. This paper conducted a concept verification in a laboratory environment, and suggested the feasibility of an objective, absolute, and hue-aware assessment.

<title>Locality-Aware Zero-Shot Human-Object Interaction Detection</title>

Abstract: Recent methods for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection typically leverage the generalization ability of large Vision-Language Model (VLM), i.e., CLIP, on unseen categories, showing impressive results on various zero-shot settings. However, existing methods struggle to adapt CLIP representations for human-object pairs, as CLIP tends to overlook fine-grained information necessary for distinguishing interactions. To address this issue, we devise, LAIN, a novel zero-shot HOI detection framework enhancing the locality and interaction awareness of CLIP representations. The locality awareness, which involves capturing fine-grained details and the spatial structure of individual objects, is achieved by aggregating the information and spatial priors of adjacent neighborhood patches. The interaction awareness, which involves identifying whether and how a human is interacting with an object, is achieved by capturing the interaction pattern between the human and the object. By infusing locality and interaction awareness into CLIP representation, LAIN captures detailed information about the human-object pairs. Our extensive experiments on existing benchmarks show that LAIN outperforms previous methods on various zero-shot settings, demonstrating the importance of locality and interaction awareness for effective zero-shot HOI detection.

Abstract: Multimodal machine translation (MMT) seeks to address the challenges posed by linguistic polysemy and ambiguity in translation tasks by incorporating visual information. A key bottleneck in current MMT research is the effective utilization of visual data. Previous approaches have focused on extracting global or region-level image features and using attention or gating mechanisms for multimodal information fusion. However, these methods have not adequately tackled the issue of visual information redundancy in MMT, nor have they proposed effective solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach--multimodal machine translation with visual Scene Graph Pruning (PSG), which leverages language scene graph information to guide the pruning of redundant nodes in visual scene graphs, thereby reducing noise in downstream translation tasks. Through extensive comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the PSG model. Our results also highlight the promising potential of visual information pruning in advancing the field of MMT.

<title>Toward Patient-specific Partial Point Cloud to Surface Completion for Pre- to Intra-operative Registration in Image-guided Liver Interventions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intra-operative data captured during image-guided surgery lacks sub-surface information, where key regions of interest, such as vessels and tumors, reside. Image-to-physical registration enables the fusion of pre-operative information and intra-operative data, typically represented as a point cloud. However, this registration process struggles due to partial visibility of the intra-operative point cloud. In this research, we propose a patient-specific point cloud completion approach to assist with the registration process. Specifically, we leverage VN-OccNet to generate a complete liver surface from a partial intra-operative point cloud. The network is trained in a patient-specific manner, where simulated deformations from the pre-operative model are used to train the model. First, we conduct an in-depth analysis of VN-OccNet's rotation-equivariant property and its effectiveness in recovering complete surfaces from partial intra-operative surfaces. Next, we integrate the completed intra-operative surface into the Go-ICP registration algorithm to demonstrate its utility in improving initial rigid registration outcomes. Our results highlight the promise of this patient-specific completion approach in mitigating the challenges posed by partial intra-operative visibility. The rotation equivariant and surface generation capabilities of VN-OccNet hold strong promise for developing robust registration frameworks for variations of the intra-operative point cloud.

<title>Regularized Personalization of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models without Distributional Drift</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalization using text-to-image diffusion models involves adapting a pretrained model to novel subjects with only a few image examples. This task presents a fundamental challenge, as the model must not only learn the new subject effectively but also preserve its ability to generate diverse and coherent outputs across a wide range of prompts. In other words, successful personalization requires integrating new concepts without forgetting previously learned generative capabilities. Forgetting denotes unintended distributional drift, where the model's output distribution deviates from that of the original pretrained model. In this paper, we provide an analysis of this issue and identify a mismatch between standard training objectives and the goals of personalization. To address this, we propose a new training objective based on a Lipschitz-bounded formulation that explicitly constrains deviation from the pretrained distribution. Our method provides improved control over distributional drift and performs well even in data-scarce scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing personalization methods, achieving higher CLIP-T, CLIP-I, and DINO scores.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing is rapidly advancing, yet its rigorous evaluation remains challenging due to the absence of dedicated video quality assessment (VQA) models capable of discerning the nuances of editing quality. To address this critical gap, we introduce TDVE-DB, a large-scale benchmark dataset for text-driven video editing. TDVE-DB consists of 3,857 edited videos generated from 12 diverse models across 8 editing categories, and is annotated with 173,565 human subjective ratings along three crucial dimensions, i.e., edited video quality, editing alignment, and structural consistency. Based on TDVE-DB, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation for the 12 state-of-the-art editing models revealing the strengths and weaknesses of current video techniques, and then benchmark existing VQA methods in the context of text-driven video editing evaluation. Building on these insights, we propose TDVE-Assessor, a novel VQA model specifically designed for text-driven video editing assessment. TDVE-Assessor integrates both spatial and temporal video features into a large language model (LLM) for rich contextual understanding to provide comprehensive quality assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDVE-Assessor substantially outperforms existing VQA models on TDVE-DB across all three evaluation dimensions, setting a new state-of-the-art. Both TDVE-DB and TDVE-Assessor will be released upon the publication.

<title>FlowCut: Rethinking Redundancy via Information Flow for Efficient Vision-Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration; and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x speed-up in the prefilling stage.

arXiv:2505.19546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising solution to address distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. However, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive backpropagation during adaptation, limiting their applicability in real-world, time-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we introduce SMART-PC, a skeleton-based framework that enhances resilience to corruptions by leveraging the geometric structure of 3D point clouds. During pre-training, our method predicts skeletal representations, enabling the model to extract robust and meaningful geometric features that are less sensitive to corruptions, thereby improving adaptability to test-time distribution shifts. Unlike prior approaches, SMART-PC achieves real-time adaptation by eliminating backpropagation and updating only BatchNorm statistics, resulting in a lightweight and efficient framework capable of achieving high frame-per-second rates while maintaining superior classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including ModelNet40-C, ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C, demonstrate that SMART-PC achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing methods such as MATE in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/AliBahri94/SMART-PC.

Existing graph-based layout generation approaches suffer from limited generative capability, often resulting in unreasonable and incompatible outputs. Meanwhile, vision based generative models tend to overlook the original structural information, leading to component intersections and overlaps. To address these challenges, we propose an Aggregation Structural Representation (ASR) module that integrates graph networks with large language models (LLMs) to preserve structural information while enhancing generative capability. This novel pipeline utilizes graph features as hierarchical prior knowledge, replacing the traditional Vision Transformer (ViT) module in multimodal large language models (MLLM) to predict full layout information for the first time. Moreover, the intermediate graph matrix used as input for the LLM is human editable, enabling progressive, human centric design generation. A comprehensive evaluation on the RICO dataset demonstrates the strong performance of ASR, both quantitatively using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and qualitatively through a crowdsourced user study. Additionally, sampling on relational features ensures diverse layout generation, further enhancing the adaptability and creativity of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Neural fields are now the central focus of research in 3D vision and computer graphics. Existing methods mainly focus on various scene representations, such as neural points and 3D Gaussians. However, few works have studied the rendering process to enhance the neural fields. In this work, we propose a plug-in method named K-Buffers that leverages multiple buffers to improve the rendering performance. Our method first renders K buffers from scene representations and constructs K pixel-wise feature maps. Then, We introduce a K-Feature Fusion Network (KFN) to merge the K pixel-wise feature maps. Finally, we adopt a feature decoder to generate the rendering image. We also introduce an acceleration strategy to improve rendering speed and quality. We apply our method to well-known radiance field baselines, including neural point fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the rendering performance of neural point fields and 3DGS.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems have rapidly evolved to tackle incremental recognition challenges in operational settings. Data scarcity remains a major hurdle that conventional SAR-ATR techniques struggle to address. To cope with this challenge, we propose a few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) framework based on a dual-branch architecture that focuses on local feature extraction and leverages the discrete Fourier transform and global filters to capture long-term spatial dependencies. This incorporates a lightweight cross-attention mechanism that fuses domain-specific features with global dependencies to ensure robust feature interaction, while maintaining computational efficiency by introducing minimal scale-shift parameters. The framework combines focal loss for class distinction under imbalance and center loss for compact intra-class distributions to enhance class separation boundaries. Experimental results on the MSTAR benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in FSCIL SAR-ATR, attesting to its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

<title>What You Perceive Is What You Conceive: A Cognition-Inspired Framework for Open Vocabulary Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Open vocabulary image segmentation tackles the challenge of recognizing dynamically adjustable, predefined novel categories at inference time by leveraging vision-language alignment. However, existing paradigms typically perform class-agnostic region segmentation followed by category matching, which deviates from the human visual system's process of recognizing objects based on semantic concepts, leading to poor alignment between region segmentation and target concepts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cognition-Inspired Framework for open vocabulary image segmentation that emulates the human visual recognition process: first forming a conceptual understanding of an object, then perceiving its spatial extent. The framework consists of three core components: (1) A Generative Vision-Language Model (G-VLM) that mimics human cognition by generating object concepts to provide semantic guidance for region segmentation. (2) A Concept-Aware Visual Enhancer Module that fuses textual concept features with global visual representations, enabling adaptive visual perception based on target concepts. (3) A Cognition-Inspired Decoder that integrates local instance features with G-VLM-provided semantic cues, allowing selective classification over a subset of relevant categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements, reaching $27.2$ PQ, $17.0$ mAP, and $35.3$ mIoU on A-150. It further attains $56.2$, $28.2$, $15.4$, $59.2$, $18.7$, and $95.8$ mIoU on Cityscapes, Mapillary Vistas, A-847, PC-59, PC-459, and PAS-20, respectively. In addition, our framework supports vocabulary-free segmentation, offering enhanced flexibility in recognizing unseen categories. Code will be public.

<title>VTBench: Comprehensive Benchmark Suite Towards Real-World Virtual Try-on Models</title>

Abstract: While virtual try-on has achieved significant progress, evaluating these models towards real-world scenarios remains a challenge. A comprehensive benchmark is essential for three key reasons:(1) Current metrics inadequately reflect human perception, particularly in unpaired try-on settings;(2)Most existing test sets are limited to indoor scenarios, lacking complexity for real-world evaluation; and (3) An ideal system should guide future advancements in virtual try-on generation. To address these needs, we introduce VTBench, a hierarchical benchmark suite that systematically decomposes virtual image try-on into hierarchical, disentangled dimensions, each equipped with tailored test sets and evaluation criteria. VTBench exhibits three key advantages:1) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework: The benchmark encompasses five critical dimensions for virtual try-on generation (e.g., overall image quality, texture preservation, complex background consistency, cross-category size adaptability, and hand-occlusion handling). Granular evaluation metrics of corresponding test sets pinpoint model capabilities and limitations across diverse, challenging scenarios.2) Human Alignment: Human preference annotations are provided for each test set, ensuring the benchmark's alignment with perceptual quality across all evaluation dimensions. (3) Valuable Insights: Beyond standard indoor settings, we analyze model performance variations across dimensions and investigate the disparity between indoor and real-world try-on scenarios. To foster the field of virtual try-on towards challenging real-world scenario, VTBench will be open-sourced, including all test sets, evaluation protocols, generated results, and human annotations.

<title>Guard Me If You Know Me: Protecting Specific Face-Identity from Deepfakes</title>

Abstract: Securing personal identity against deepfake attacks is increasingly critical in the digital age, especially for celebrities and political figures whose faces are easily accessible and frequently targeted. Most existing deepfake detection methods focus on general-purpose scenarios and often ignore the valuable prior knowledge of known facial identities, e.g., "VIP individuals" whose authentic facial data are already available. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VIPGuard}, a unified multimodal framework designed to capture fine-grained and comprehensive facial representations of a given identity, compare them against potentially fake or similar-looking faces, and reason over these comparisons to make accurate and explainable predictions. Specifically, our framework consists of three main stages. First, fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to learn detailed and structural facial attributes. Second, we perform identity-level discriminative learning to enable the model to distinguish subtle differences between highly similar faces, including real and fake variations. Finally, we introduce user-specific customization, where we model the unique characteristics of the target face identity and perform semantic reasoning via MLLM to enable personalized and explainable deepfake detection. Our framework shows clear advantages over previous detection works, where traditional detectors mainly rely on low-level visual cues and provide no human-understandable explanations, while other MLLM-based models often lack a detailed understanding of specific face identities. To facilitate the evaluation of our method, we built a comprehensive identity-aware benchmark called \textbf{VIPBench} for personalized deepfake detection, involving the latest 7 face-swapping and 7 entire face synthesis techniques for generation.

<title>Beyond Segmentation: Confidence-Aware and Debiased Estimation of Ratio-based Biomarkers</title>

Abstract: Ratio-based biomarkers -- such as the proportion of necrotic tissue within a tumor -- are widely used in clinical practice to support diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning. These biomarkers are typically estimated from soft segmentation outputs by computing region-wise ratios. Despite the high-stakes nature of clinical decision making, existing methods provide only point estimates, offering no measure of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a unified \textit{confidence-aware} framework for estimating ratio-based biomarkers. We conduct a systematic analysis of error propagation in the segmentation-to-biomarker pipeline and identify model miscalibration as the dominant source of uncertainty. To mitigate this, we incorporate a lightweight, post-hoc calibration module that can be applied using internal hospital data without retraining. We leverage a tunable parameter $Q$ to control the confidence level of the derived bounds, allowing adaptation towards clinical practice. Extensive experiments show that our method produces statistically sound confidence intervals, with tunable confidence levels, enabling more trustworthy application of predictive biomarkers in clinical workflows.

<title>Rep3D: Re-parameterize Large 3D Kernels with Low-Rank Receptive Modeling for Medical Imaging</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19603</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to vision transformers, which model long-range dependencies through global self-attention, large kernel convolutions provide a more efficient and scalable alternative, particularly in high-resolution 3D volumetric settings. However, naively increasing kernel size often leads to optimization instability and degradation in performance. Motivated by the spatial bias observed in effective receptive fields (ERFs), we hypothesize that different kernel elements converge at variable rates during training. To support this, we derive a theoretical connection between element-wise gradients and first-order optimization, showing that structurally re-parameterized convolution blocks inherently induce spatially varying learning rates. Building on this insight, we introduce Rep3D, a 3D convolutional framework that incorporates a learnable spatial prior into large kernel training. A lightweight two-stage modulation network generates a receptive-biased scaling mask, adaptively re-weighting kernel updates and enabling local-to-global convergence behavior. Rep3D adopts a plain encoder design with large depthwise convolutions, avoiding the architectural complexity of multi-branch compositions. We evaluate Rep3D on five challenging 3D segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, including transformer-based and fixed-prior re-parameterization methods. By unifying spatial inductive bias with optimization-aware learning, Rep3D offers an interpretable, and scalable solution for 3D medical image analysis.

<title>JailBound: Jailbreaking Internal Safety Boundaries of Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19610</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive performance, yet the integration of powerful vision encoders has significantly broadened their attack surface, rendering them increasingly susceptible to jailbreak attacks. However, lacking well-defined attack objectives, existing jailbreak methods often struggle with gradient-based strategies prone to local optima and lacking precise directional guidance, and typically decouple visual and textual modalities, thereby limiting their effectiveness by neglecting crucial cross-modal interactions. Inspired by the Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK) framework, we posit that VLMs encode safety-relevant information within their internal fusion-layer representations, revealing an implicit safety decision boundary in the latent space. This motivates exploiting boundary to steer model behavior. Accordingly, we propose JailBound, a novel latent space jailbreak framework comprising two stages: (1) Safety Boundary Probing, which addresses the guidance issue by approximating decision boundary within fusion layer's latent space, thereby identifying optimal perturbation directions towards the target region; and (2) Safety Boundary Crossing, which overcomes the limitations of decoupled approaches by jointly optimizing adversarial perturbations across both image and text inputs. This latter stage employs an innovative mechanism to steer the model's internal state towards policy-violating outputs while maintaining cross-modal semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on six diverse VLMs demonstrate JailBound's efficacy, achieves 94.32% white-box and 67.28% black-box attack success averagely, which are 6.17% and 21.13% higher than SOTA methods, respectively. Our findings expose a overlooked safety risk in VLMs and highlight the urgent need for more robust defenses. Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive, harmful and offensive content.

<title>Align and Surpass Human Camouflaged Perception: Visual Refocus Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Current multi-modal models exhibit a notable misalignment with the human visual system when identifying objects that are visually assimilated into the background. Our observations reveal that these multi-modal models cannot distinguish concealed objects, demonstrating an inability to emulate human cognitive processes which effectively utilize foreground-background similarity principles for visual analysis. To analyze this hidden human-model visual thinking discrepancy, we build a visual system that mimicks human visual camouflaged perception to progressively and iteratively `refocus' visual concealed content. The refocus is a progressive guidance mechanism enabling models to logically localize objects in visual images through stepwise reasoning. The localization process of concealed objects requires hierarchical attention shifting with dynamic adjustment and refinement of prior cognitive knowledge. In this paper, we propose a visual refocus reinforcement framework via the policy optimization algorithm to encourage multi-modal models to think and refocus more before answering, and achieve excellent reasoning abilities to align and even surpass human camouflaged perception systems. Our extensive experiments on camouflaged perception successfully demonstrate the emergence of refocus visual phenomena, characterized by multiple reasoning tokens and dynamic adjustment of the detection box. Besides, experimental results on both camouflaged object classification and detection tasks exhibit significantly superior performance compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baselines.

<title>TESSER: Transfer-Enhancing Adversarial Attacks from Vision Transformers via Spectral and Semantic Regularization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19613</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial transferability remains a critical challenge in evaluating the robustness of deep neural networks. In security-critical applications, transferability enables black-box attacks without access to model internals, making it a key concern for real-world adversarial threat assessment. While Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong adversarial performance, existing attacks often fail to transfer effectively across architectures, especially from ViTs to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or hybrid models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TESSER} -- a novel adversarial attack framework that enhances transferability via two key strategies: (1) \textit{Feature-Sensitive Gradient Scaling (FSGS)}, which modulates gradients based on token-wise importance derived from intermediate feature activations, and (2) \textit{Spectral Smoothness Regularization (SSR)}, which suppresses high-frequency noise in perturbations using a differentiable Gaussian prior. These components work in tandem to generate perturbations that are both semantically meaningful and spectrally smooth. Extensive experiments on ImageNet across 12 diverse architectures demonstrate that TESSER achieves +10.9\% higher attack succes rate (ASR) on CNNs and +7.2\% on ViTs compared to the state-of-the-art Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT) method. Moreover, TESSER significantly improves robustness against defended models, achieving 53.55\% ASR on adversarially trained CNNs. Qualitative analysis shows strong alignment between TESSER's perturbations and salient visual regions identified via Grad-CAM, while frequency-domain analysis reveals a 12\% reduction in high-frequency energy, confirming the effectiveness of spectral regularization.

<title>Rotation-Equivariant Self-Supervised Method in Image Denoising</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised image denoising methods have garnered significant research attention in recent years, for this kind of method reduces the requirement of large training datasets. Compared to supervised methods, self-supervised methods rely more on the prior embedded in deep networks themselves. As a result, most of the self-supervised methods are designed with Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures, which well capture one of the most important image prior, translation equivariant prior. Inspired by the great success achieved by the introduction of translational equivariance, in this paper, we explore the way to further incorporate another important image prior. Specifically, we first apply high-accuracy rotation equivariant convolution to self-supervised image denoising. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we have proved that simply replacing all the convolution layers with rotation equivariant convolution layers would modify the network into its rotation equivariant version. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that rotation equivariant image prior is introduced to self-supervised image denoising at the network architecture level with a comprehensive theoretical analysis of equivariance errors, which offers a new perspective to the field of self-supervised image denoising. Moreover, to further improve the performance, we design a new mask mechanism to fusion the output of rotation equivariant network and vanilla CNN-based network, and construct an adaptive rotation equivariant framework. Through extensive experiments on three typical methods, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

arXiv:2505.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a bilingual multimodal visual question answering (VQA) benchmark for evaluating VLMs in ophthalmology. Methods: Ophthalmic image posts and associated captions published between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2024, were collected from WeChat Official Accounts. Based on these captions, bilingual question-answer (QA) pairs in Chinese and English were generated using GPT-4o-mini. QA pairs were categorized into six subsets by question type and language: binary (Binary_CN, Binary_EN), single-choice (Single-choice_CN, Single-choice_EN), and open-ended (Open-ended_CN, Open-ended_EN). The benchmark was used to evaluate the performance of three VLMs: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct. Results: The final OphthalWeChat dataset included 3,469 images and 30,120 QA pairs across 9 ophthalmic subspecialties, 548 conditions, 29 imaging modalities, and 68 modality combinations. Gemini 2.0 Flash achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.548), outperforming GPT-4o (0.522, P < 0.001) and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct (0.514, P < 0.001). It also led in both Chinese (0.546) and English subsets (0.550). Subset-specific performance showed Gemini 2.0 Flash excelled in Binary_CN (0.687), Single-choice_CN (0.666), and Single-choice_EN (0.646), while GPT-4o ranked highest in Binary_EN (0.717), Open-ended_CN (BLEU-1: 0.301; BERTScore: 0.382), and Open-ended_EN (BLEU-1: 0.183; BERTScore: 0.240). Conclusions: This study presents the first bilingual VQA benchmark for ophthalmology, distinguished by its real-world context and inclusion of multiple examinations per patient. The dataset reflects authentic clinical decision-making scenarios and enables quantitative evaluation of VLMs, supporting the development of accurate, specialized, and trustworthy AI systems for eye care.

Abstract: Virtual try-on technology has become increasingly important in the fashion and retail industries, enabling the generation of high-fidelity garment images that adapt seamlessly to target human models. While existing methods have achieved notable progress, they still face significant challenges in maintaining consistency across different poses. Specifically, geometric distortions lead to a lack of spatial consistency, mismatches in garment structure and texture across poses result in semantic inconsistency, and the loss or distortion of fine-grained details diminishes visual fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose HF-VTON, a novel framework that ensures high-fidelity virtual try-on performance across diverse poses. HF-VTON consists of three key modules: (1) the Appearance-Preserving Warp Alignment Module (APWAM), which aligns garments to human poses, addressing geometric deformations and ensuring spatial consistency; (2) the Semantic Representation and Comprehension Module (SRCM), which captures fine-grained garment attributes and multi-pose data to enhance semantic representation, maintaining structural, textural, and pattern consistency; and (3) the Multimodal Prior-Guided Appearance Generation Module (MPAGM), which integrates multimodal features and prior knowledge from pre-trained models to optimize appearance generation, ensuring both semantic and geometric consistency. Additionally, to overcome data limitations in existing benchmarks, we introduce the SAMP-VTONS dataset, featuring multi-pose pairs and rich textual annotations for a more comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that HF-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both VITON-HD and SAMP-VTONS, excelling in visual fidelity, semantic consistency, and detail preservation.

Abstract: Multimodal information retrieval (MIR) faces inherent challenges due to the heterogeneity of data sources and the complexity of cross-modal alignment. While previous studies have identified modal gaps in feature spaces, a systematic approach to address these challenges remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce UNITE, a universal framework that tackles these challenges through two critical yet underexplored aspects: data curation and modality-aware training configurations. Our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of how modality-specific data properties influence downstream task performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we propose Modal-Aware Masked Contrastive Learning (MAMCL) to mitigate the competitive relationships among the instances of different modalities. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by notable margins. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that strategic modality curation and tailored training protocols are pivotal for robust cross-modal representation learning. This work not only advances MIR performance but also provides a foundational blueprint for future research in multimodal systems. Our project is available at https://friedrichor.github.io/projects/UNITE.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are gaining traction in the visual generative area for their efficiency and compatibility. However, the pioneered attempts still fall behind the continuous counterparts, which we attribute to the noise (absorbing state) design and sampling heuristics. In this study, we propose the rehashing noise framework for discrete diffusion transformer, termed ReDDiT, to extend absorbing states and improve expressive capacity of discrete diffusion models. ReDDiT enriches the potential paths that latent variables can traverse during training with randomized multi-index corruption. The derived rehash sampler, which reverses the randomized absorbing paths, guarantees the diversity and low discrepancy of the generation process. These reformulations lead to more consistent and competitive generation quality, mitigating the need for heavily tuned randomness. Experiments show that ReDDiT significantly outperforms the baseline (reducing gFID from 6.18 to 1.61) and is on par with the continuous counterparts with higher efficiency.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models often struggle to generalize across different domains due to various reasons. Domain Generalization (DG) methods overcome this either through representation learning or data augmentation (DAug). While representation learning methods seek domain-invariant features, they often rely on ad-hoc techniques and lack formal guarantees. DAug methods, which enrich model representations through synthetic samples, have shown comparable or superior performance to representation learning approaches. We propose LangDAug, a novel $\textbf{Lang}$evin $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{Aug}$mentation for multi-source domain generalization in 2D medical image segmentation. LangDAug leverages Energy-Based Models (EBMs) trained via contrastive divergence to traverse between source domains, generating intermediate samples through Langevin dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that LangDAug induces a regularization effect, and for GLMs, it upper-bounds the Rademacher complexity by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold. Through extensive experiments on Fundus segmentation and 2D MRI prostate segmentation benchmarks, we show that LangDAug outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods and effectively complements existing domain-randomization approaches. The codebase for our method is available at https://github.com/backpropagator/LangDAug.

<title>Burst Image Super-Resolution via Multi-Cross Attention Encoding and Multi-Scan State-Space Decoding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19668</link>

arXiv:2505.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-image super-resolution (MISR) can achieve higher image quality than single-image super-resolution (SISR) by aggregating sub-pixel information from multiple spatially shifted frames. Among MISR tasks, burst super-resolution (BurstSR) has gained significant attention due to its wide range of applications. Recent methods have increasingly adopted Transformers over convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in super-resolution tasks, due to their superior ability to capture both local and global context. However, most existing approaches still rely on fixed and narrow attention windows that restrict the perception of features beyond the local field. This limitation hampers alignment and feature aggregation, both of which are crucial for high-quality super-resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a novel feature extractor that incorporates two newly designed attention mechanisms: overlapping cross-window attention and cross-frame attention, enabling more precise and efficient extraction of sub-pixel information across multiple frames. Furthermore, we introduce a Multi-scan State-Space Module with the cross-frame attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Additional evaluations on ISO 12233 resolution test charts further confirm its enhanced super-resolution performance.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLRMs) has enabled sophisticated visual reasoning capabilities by integrating reinforcement learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. However, while these enhanced reasoning capabilities improve performance, they also introduce new and underexplored safety risks. In this work, we systematically investigate the security implications of advanced visual reasoning in MLRMs. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: as visual reasoning improves, models become more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Motivated by this critical finding, we introduce VisCRA (Visual Chain Reasoning Attack), a novel jailbreak framework that exploits the visual reasoning chains to bypass safety mechanisms. VisCRA combines targeted visual attention masking with a two-stage reasoning induction strategy to precisely control harmful outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate VisCRA's significant effectiveness, achieving high attack success rates on leading closed-source MLRMs: 76.48% on Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, 68.56% on QvQ-Max, and 56.60% on GPT-4o. Our findings highlight a critical insight: the very capability that empowers MLRMs -- their visual reasoning -- can also serve as an attack vector, posing significant security risks.

<title>DriveCamSim: Generalizable Camera Simulation via Explicit Camera Modeling for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Camera sensor simulation serves as a critical role for autonomous driving (AD), e.g. evaluating vision-based AD algorithms. While existing approaches have leveraged generative models for controllable image/video generation, they remain constrained to generating multi-view video sequences with fixed camera viewpoints and video frequency, significantly limiting their downstream applications. To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation framework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit Camera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through vanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across multi-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to the specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of views) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data. For controllable generation, we identify the issue of information loss inherent in existing conditional encoding and injection pipelines, proposing an information-preserving control mechanism. This control mechanism not only improves conditional controllability, but also can be extended to be identity-aware to enhance temporal consistency in foreground object rendering. With above designs, our model demonstrates superior performance in both visual quality and controllability, as well as generalization capability across spatial-level (camera parameters variations) and temporal-level (video frame rate variations), enabling flexible user-customizable camera simulation tailored to diverse application scenarios. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/swc-17/DriveCamSim for facilitating future research.

<title>Knowledge-Aligned Counterfactual-Enhancement Diffusion Perception for Unsupervised Cross-Domain Visual Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is a critical yet challenging task aimed at inferring emotional states of individuals based on visual cues. However, existing works focus on single domains, e.g., realistic images or stickers, limiting VER models' cross-domain generalizability. To fill this gap, we introduce an Unsupervised Cross-Domain Visual Emotion Recognition (UCDVER) task, which aims to generalize visual emotion recognition from the source domain (e.g., realistic images) to the low-resource target domain (e.g., stickers) in an unsupervised manner. Compared to the conventional unsupervised domain adaptation problems, UCDVER presents two key challenges: a significant emotional expression variability and an affective distribution shift. To mitigate these issues, we propose the Knowledge-aligned Counterfactual-enhancement Diffusion Perception (KCDP) framework. Specifically, KCDP leverages a VLM to align emotional representations in a shared knowledge space and guides diffusion models for improved visual affective perception. Furthermore, a Counterfactual-Enhanced Language-image Emotional Alignment (CLIEA) method generates high-quality pseudo-labels for the target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses SOTA models in both perceptibility and generalization, e.g., gaining 12% improvements over the SOTA VER model TGCA-PVT.

<title>Modeling Beyond MOS: Quality Assessment Models Must Integrate Context, Reasoning, and Multimodality</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19696</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper argues that Mean Opinion Score (MOS), while historically foundational, is no longer sufficient as the sole supervisory signal for multimedia quality assessment models. MOS reduces rich, context-sensitive human judgments to a single scalar, obscuring semantic failures, user intent, and the rationale behind quality decisions. We contend that modern quality assessment models must integrate three interdependent capabilities: (1) context-awareness, to adapt evaluations to task-specific goals and viewing conditions; (2) reasoning, to produce interpretable, evidence-grounded justifications for quality judgments; and (3) multimodality, to align perceptual and semantic cues using vision-language models. We critique the limitations of current MOS-centric benchmarks and propose a roadmap for reform: richer datasets with contextual metadata and expert rationales, and new evaluation metrics that assess semantic alignment, reasoning fidelity, and contextual sensitivity. By reframing quality assessment as a contextual, explainable, and multimodal modeling task, we aim to catalyze a shift toward more robust, human-aligned, and trustworthy evaluation systems.

<title>Point-RFT: Improving Multimodal Reasoning with Visually Grounded Reinforcement Finetuning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have significantly improved textual reasoning through the effective use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning. However, extending these successes to vision-language tasks remains challenging due to inherent limitations in text-only CoT, such as visual hallucinations and insufficient multimodal integration. In this paper, we introduce Point-RFT, a multimodal reasoning framework explicitly designed to leverage visually grounded CoT reasoning for visual document understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: First, we conduct format finetuning using a curated dataset of 71K diverse visual reasoning problems, each annotated with detailed, step-by-step rationales explicitly grounded to corresponding visual elements. Second, we employ reinforcement finetuning targeting visual document understanding. On ChartQA, our approach improves accuracy from 70.88% (format-finetuned baseline) to 90.04%, surpassing the 83.92% accuracy achieved by reinforcement finetuning relying solely on text-based CoT. The result shows that our grounded CoT is more effective for multimodal reasoning compared with the text-only CoT. Moreover, Point-RFT exhibits superior generalization capability across several out-of-domain visual document reasoning benchmarks, including CharXiv, PlotQA, IconQA, TabMWP, etc., and highlights its potential in complex real-world scenarios.

<title>MLLM-Guided VLM Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19707</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) methods typically train adapters that convert reference images into pseudo-text tokens, which are concatenated with the modifying text and processed by frozen text encoders in pretrained VLMs or LLMs. While this design leverages the strengths of large pretrained models, it only supervises the adapter to produce encoder-compatible tokens that loosely preserve visual semantics. Crucially, it does not directly optimize the composed query representation to capture the full intent of the composition or to align with the target semantics, thereby limiting retrieval performance, particularly in cases involving fine-grained or complex visual transformations. To address this problem, we propose MLLM-Guided VLM Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference (MVFT-JI), a novel approach that leverages a pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) to construct two complementary training tasks using only unlabeled images: target text retrieval taskand text-to-image retrieval task. By jointly optimizing these tasks, our method enables the VLM to inherently acquire robust compositional retrieval capabilities, supported by the provided theoretical justifications and empirical validation. Furthermore, during inference, we further prompt the MLLM to generate target texts from composed queries and compute retrieval scores by integrating similarities between (i) the composed query and candidate images, and (ii) the MLLM-generated target text and candidate images. This strategy effectively combines the VLM's semantic alignment strengths with the MLLM's reasoning capabilities.

arXiv:2505.19733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately delineating the visual pathway (VP) is crucial for understanding the human visual system and diagnosing related disorders. Exploring multi-parametric MR imaging data has been identified as an important way to delineate VP. However, due to the complex cross-sequence relationships, existing methods cannot effectively model the complementary information from different MRI sequences. In addition, these existing methods heavily rely on large training data with labels, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to obtain. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-parametric feature decomposition framework for VP delineation. Specifically, a correlation-constrained feature decomposition (CFD) is designed to handle the complex cross-sequence relationships by capturing the unique characteristics of each MRI sequence and easing the multi-parametric information fusion process. Furthermore, a consistency-based sample enhancement (CSE) module is developed to address the limited labeled data issue, by generating and promoting meaningful edge information from unlabeled data. We validate our framework using two public datasets, and one in-house Multi-Shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of delineation performance when compared to seven state-of-the-art approaches.

arXiv:2505.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-centered images often suffer from severe generic degradation during transmission and are prone to human motion blur (HMB), making restoration challenging. Existing research lacks sufficient focus on these issues, as both problems often coexist in practice. To address this, we design a degradation pipeline that simulates the coexistence of HMB and generic noise, generating synthetic degraded data to train our proposed HAODiff, a human-aware one-step diffusion. Specifically, we propose a triple-branch dual-prompt guidance (DPG), which leverages high-quality images, residual noise (LQ minus HQ), and HMB segmentation masks as training targets. It produces a positive-negative prompt pair for classifier-free guidance (CFG) in a single diffusion step. The resulting adaptive dual prompts let HAODiff exploit CFG more effectively, boosting robustness against diverse degradations. For fair evaluation, we introduce MPII-Test, a benchmark rich in combined noise and HMB cases. Extensive experiments show that our HAODiff surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality on synthetic and real-world datasets, including our introduced MPII-Test.

Abstract: Accurate identification of acute cellular rejection (ACR) in endomyocardial biopsies is essential for effective management of heart transplant patients. However, the rarity of high-grade rejection cases (3R) presents a significant challenge for training robust deep learning models. This work addresses the class imbalance problem by leveraging synthetic data generation using StyleGAN to augment the limited number of real 3R images. Prior to GAN training, histogram equalization was applied to standardize image appearance and improve the consistency of tissue representation. StyleGAN was trained on available 3R biopsy patches and subsequently used to generate 10,000 realistic synthetic images. These were combined with real 0R samples, that is samples without rejection, in various configurations to train ResNet-18 classifiers for binary rejection classification.
  Three classifier variants were evaluated: one trained on real 0R and synthetic 3R images, another using both synthetic and additional real samples, and a third trained solely on real data. All models were tested on an independent set of real biopsy images. Results demonstrate that synthetic data improves classification performance, particularly when used in combination with real samples. The highest-performing model, which used both real and synthetic images, achieved strong precision and recall for both classes. These findings underscore the value of hybrid training strategies and highlight the potential of GAN-based data augmentation in biomedical image analysis, especially in domains constrained by limited annotated datasets.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present our solution to the CVPR 2025 Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) 3.0 Workshop Challenge Track 1: Adapt & Detect: Robust Anomaly Detection in Real-World Applications. In real-world industrial anomaly detection, it is crucial to accurately identify anomalies with physical complexity, such as transparent or reflective surfaces, occlusions, and low-contrast contaminations. The recently proposed MVTec AD 2 dataset significantly narrows the gap between publicly available benchmarks and anomalies found in real-world industrial environments. To address the challenges posed by this dataset--such as complex and varying lighting conditions and real anomalies with large scale differences--we propose a fully training-free anomaly detection and segmentation method based on feature extraction using the DINOv2 model named SuperAD. Our method carefully selects a small number of normal reference images and constructs a memory bank by leveraging the strong representational power of DINOv2. Anomalies are then segmented by performing nearest neighbor matching between test image features and the memory bank. Our method achieves competitive results on both test sets of the MVTec AD 2 dataset.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition aims at separating an image into its underlying albedo and shading components, isolating the base color from lighting effects to enable downstream applications such as virtual relighting and scene editing. Despite the rise and success of learning-based approaches, intrinsic image decomposition from real-world images remains a significant challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled ground-truth data. Most existing solutions rely on synthetic data as supervised setups, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world scenes. Self-supervised methods, on the other hand, often produce albedo maps that contain reflections and lack consistency under different lighting conditions. To address this, we propose SAIL, an approach designed to estimate albedo-like representations from single-view real-world images. We repurpose the prior knowledge of a latent diffusion model for unconditioned scene relighting as a surrogate objective for albedo estimation. To extract the albedo, we introduce a novel intrinsic image decomposition fully formulated in the latent space. To guide the training of our latent diffusion model, we introduce regularization terms that constrain both the lighting-dependent and independent components of our latent image decomposition. SAIL predicts stable albedo under varying lighting conditions and generalizes to multiple scenes, using only unlabeled multi-illumination data available online.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generalizable novel view synthesis have achieved impressive quality through interpolation between nearby views. However, rendering high-resolution images remains computationally intensive due to the need for dense sampling of all rays. Recognizing that natural scenes are typically piecewise smooth and sampling all rays is often redundant, we propose a novel depth-guided bundle sampling strategy to accelerate rendering. By grouping adjacent rays into a bundle and sampling them collectively, a shared representation is generated for decoding all rays within the bundle. To further optimize efficiency, our adaptive sampling strategy dynamically allocates samples based on depth confidence, concentrating more samples in complex regions while reducing them in smoother areas. When applied to ENeRF, our method achieves up to a 1.27 dB PSNR improvement and a 47% increase in FPS on the DTU dataset. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering quality and up to 2x faster rendering compared to existing generalizable methods.

Abstract: Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4 mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

arXiv:2505.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant and invariant deep learning models have been developed to exploit intrinsic symmetries in data, demonstrating significant effectiveness in certain scenarios. However, these methods often suffer from limited representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration, providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The design of convolutional neural architectures that are exactly equivariant to continuous translations is an active field of research. It promises to benefit scientific computing, notably by making existing imaging systems more physically accurate. Most efforts focus on the design of downsampling/pooling layers, upsampling layers and activation functions, but little attention is dedicated to normalization layers. In this work, we present a novel theoretical framework for understanding the equivariance of normalization layers to discrete shifts and continuous translations. We also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for normalization layers to be equivariant in terms of the dimensions they operate on. Using real feature maps from ResNet-18 and ImageNet, we test those theoretical results empirically and find that they are consistent with our predictions.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to adapting multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to new tasks have relied heavily on fine-tuning. This paper introduces Efficient Multi-Modal Long Context Learning (EMLoC), a novel training-free alternative that embeds demonstration examples directly into the model input. EMLoC offers a more efficient, flexible, and scalable solution for task adaptation. Because extremely lengthy inputs introduce prohibitive computational and memory overhead, EMLoC contributes a chunk-wise compression mechanism combined with layer-wise adaptive pruning. It condenses long-context multimodal inputs into compact, task-specific memory representations. By adaptively pruning tokens at each layer under a Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint, our method achieves a dramatic reduction in inference complexity without sacrificing performance. This approach is the first to seamlessly integrate compression and pruning techniques for multi-modal long-context learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for real-world applications. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that EMLoC achieves performance on par with or superior to naive long-context approaches. Our results highlight the potential of EMLoC as a groundbreaking framework for efficient and flexible adaptation of multi-modal models in resource-constrained environments. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/EMLoC.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have transformed novel view synthesis by modeling scene-specific volumetric representations directly from images. While generalizable NeRF models can generate novel views across unknown scenes by learning latent ray representations, their performance heavily depends on a large number of multi-view observations. However, with limited input views, these methods experience significant degradation in rendering quality. To address this limitation, we propose GoLF-NRT: a Global and Local feature Fusion-based Neural Rendering Transformer. GoLF-NRT enhances generalizable neural rendering from few input views by leveraging a 3D transformer with efficient sparse attention to capture global scene context. In parallel, it integrates local geometric features extracted along the epipolar line, enabling high-quality scene reconstruction from as few as 1 to 3 input views. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy based on attention weights and kernel regression, improving the accuracy of transformer-based neural rendering. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that GoLF-NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying numbers of input views, highlighting the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis and autonomous driving and has a problem with the high cost of annotating the labels required in training. To address this problem, semantic segmentation methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets: PASCAL and MS COCO.

Abstract: Evaluating the video understanding capabilities of Video-Language Models (VLMs) remains a significant challenge. We propose a long-context video understanding benchmark, Causal2Needles, that assesses two crucial abilities insufficiently evaluated by existing benchmarks: (1) the ability to extract information from two separate locations in a long video and understand them jointly, and (2) the ability to model the world in terms of cause and effect in human behaviors. Specifically, Causal2Needles introduces 2-needle questions, which require extracting information from both the cause and effect human-behavior events in a long video and the associated narration text. To prevent textual bias, these questions comprise two complementary formats: one asking to identify the video clip containing the answer, and one asking for the textual description of an unrelated visual detail from that video clip. Our experiments reveal that models excelling in pre-existing benchmarks struggle with 2-needle visual grounding, and the model performance is negatively correlated with the distance between the two needles. These findings highlight critical limitations in current VLMs.

<title>Sparse2DGS: Sparse-View Surface Reconstruction using 2D Gaussian Splatting with Dense Point Cloud</title>

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has gained attention as a fast and effective method for novel view synthesis. It has also been applied to 3D reconstruction using multi-view images and can achieve fast and accurate 3D reconstruction. However, GS assumes that the input contains a large number of multi-view images, and therefore, the reconstruction accuracy significantly decreases when only a limited number of input images are available. One of the main reasons is the insufficient number of 3D points in the sparse point cloud obtained through Structure from Motion (SfM), which results in a poor initialization for optimizing the Gaussian primitives. We propose a new 3D reconstruction method, called Sparse2DGS, to enhance 2DGS in reconstructing objects using only three images. Sparse2DGS employs DUSt3R, a fundamental model for stereo images, along with COLMAP MVS to generate highly accurate and dense 3D point clouds, which are then used to initialize 2D Gaussians. Through experiments on the DTU dataset, we show that Sparse2DGS can accurately reconstruct the 3D shapes of objects using just three images.

arXiv:2505.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real world is dynamic, yet most image fusion methods process static frames independently, ignoring temporal correlations in videos and leading to flickering and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we propose Unified Video Fusion (UniVF), a novel framework for temporally coherent video fusion that leverages multi-frame learning and optical flow-based feature warping for informative, temporally coherent video fusion. To support its development, we also introduce Video Fusion Benchmark (VF-Bench), the first comprehensive benchmark covering four video fusion tasks: multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared-visible, and medical fusion. VF-Bench provides high-quality, well-aligned video pairs obtained through synthetic data generation and rigorous curation from existing datasets, with a unified evaluation protocol that jointly assesses the spatial quality and temporal consistency of video fusion. Extensive experiments show that UniVF achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks on VF-Bench. Project page: https://vfbench.github.io.

<title>FruitNeRF++: A Generalized Multi-Fruit Counting Method Utilizing Contrastive Learning and Neural Radiance Fields</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19863</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce FruitNeRF++, a novel fruit-counting approach that combines contrastive learning with neural radiance fields to count fruits from unstructured input photographs of orchards. Our work is based on FruitNeRF, which employs a neural semantic field combined with a fruit-specific clustering approach. The requirement for adaptation for each fruit type limits the applicability of the method, and makes it difficult to use in practice. To lift this limitation, we design a shape-agnostic multi-fruit counting framework, that complements the RGB and semantic data with instance masks predicted by a vision foundation model. The masks are used to encode the identity of each fruit as instance embeddings into a neural instance field. By volumetrically sampling the neural fields, we extract a point cloud embedded with the instance features, which can be clustered in a fruit-agnostic manner to obtain the fruit count. We evaluate our approach using a synthetic dataset containing apples, plums, lemons, pears, peaches, and mangoes, as well as a real-world benchmark apple dataset. Our results demonstrate that FruitNeRF++ is easier to control and compares favorably to other state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Harnessing the Power of Training-Free Techniques in Text-to-2D Generation for Text-to-3D Generation via Score Distillation Sampling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19868</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19868</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies show that simple training-free techniques can dramatically improve the quality of text-to-2D generation outputs, e.g. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) or FreeU. However, these training-free techniques have been underexplored in the lens of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is a popular and effective technique to leverage the power of pretrained text-to-2D diffusion models for various tasks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the effect such training-free techniques have on SDS, via a particular application of text-to-3D generation via 2D lifting. We present our findings, which show that varying the scales of CFG presents a trade-off between object size and surface smoothness, while varying the scales of FreeU presents a trade-off between texture details and geometric errors. Based on these findings, we provide insights into how we can effectively harness training-free techniques for SDS, via a strategic scaling of such techniques in a dynamic manner with respect to the timestep or optimization iteration step. We show that using our proposed scheme strikes a favorable balance between texture details and surface smoothness in text-to-3D generations, while preserving the size of the output and mitigating the occurrence of geometric defects.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Deep Spectral Prior (DSP), a new formulation of Deep Image Prior (DIP) that redefines image reconstruction as a frequency-domain alignment problem. Unlike traditional DIP, which relies on pixel-wise loss and early stopping to mitigate overfitting, DSP directly matches Fourier coefficients between the network output and observed measurements. This shift introduces an explicit inductive bias towards spectral coherence, aligning with the known frequency structure of images and the spectral bias of convolutional neural networks. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating that DSP acts as an implicit spectral regulariser, suppressing high-frequency noise by design and eliminating the need for early stopping. Our analysis spans four core dimensions establishing smooth convergence dynamics, local stability, and favourable bias-variance tradeoffs. We further show that DSP naturally projects reconstructions onto a frequency-consistent manifold, enhancing interpretability and robustness. These theoretical guarantees are supported by empirical results across denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks, where DSP consistently outperforms classical DIP and other unsupervised baselines.

<title>StyleAR: Customizing Multimodal Autoregressive Model for Style-Aligned Text-to-Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19874</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current research landscape, multimodal autoregressive (AR) models have shown exceptional capabilities across various domains, including visual understanding and generation. However, complex tasks such as style-aligned text-to-image generation present significant challenges, particularly in data acquisition. In analogy to instruction-following tuning for image editing of AR models, style-aligned generation requires a reference style image and prompt, resulting in a text-image-to-image triplet where the output shares the style and semantics of the input. However, acquiring large volumes of such triplet data with specific styles is considerably more challenging than obtaining conventional text-to-image data used for training generative models. To address this issue, we propose StyleAR, an innovative approach that combines a specially designed data curation method with our proposed AR models to effectively utilize text-to-image binary data for style-aligned text-to-image generation. Our method synthesizes target stylized data using a reference style image and prompt, but only incorporates the target stylized image as the image modality to create high-quality binary data. To facilitate binary data training, we introduce a CLIP image encoder with a perceiver resampler that translates the image input into style tokens aligned with multimodal tokens in AR models and implement a style-enhanced token technique to prevent content leakage which is a common issue in previous work. Furthermore, we mix raw images drawn from large-scale text-image datasets with stylized images to enhance StyleAR's ability to extract richer stylistic features and ensure style consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at https://github.com/wbfwonderful/Vad-R1.

arXiv:2505.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of multi-view images acquired by a 360-degree camera can reconstruct a 3D space with a wide area. There are 3D reconstruction methods from equirectangular images based on NeRF and 3DGS, as well as Novel View Synthesis (NVS) methods. On the other hand, it is necessary to overcome the large distortion caused by the projection model of a 360-degree camera when equirectangular images are used. In 3DGS-based methods, the large distortion of the 360-degree camera model generates extremely large 3D Gaussians, resulting in poor rendering accuracy. We propose ErpGS, which is Omnidirectional GS based on 3DGS to realize NVS addressing the problems. ErpGS introduce some rendering accuracy improvement techniques: geometric regularization, scale regularization, and distortion-aware weights and a mask to suppress the effects of obstacles in equirectangular images. Through experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that ErpGS can render novel view images more accurately than conventional methods.

Abstract: Current video-based fall detection research mostly relies on small, staged datasets with significant domain biases concerning background, lighting, and camera setup resulting in unknown real-world performance. We introduce OmniFall, unifying eight public fall detection datasets (roughly 14 h of recordings, roughly 42 h of multiview data, 101 subjects, 29 camera views) under a consistent ten-class taxonomy with standardized evaluation protocols. Our benchmark provides complete video segmentation labels and enables fair cross-dataset comparison previously impossible with incompatible annotation schemes. For real-world evaluation we curate OOPS-Fall from genuine accident videos and establish a staged-to-wild protocol measuring generalization from controlled to uncontrolled environments. Experiments with frozen pre-trained backbones such as I3D or VideoMAE reveal significant performance gaps between in-distribution and in-the-wild scenarios, highlighting critical challenges in developing robust fall detection systems.

<title>Underwater Diffusion Attention Network with Contrastive Language-Image Joint Learning for Underwater Image Enhancement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater images are often affected by complex degradations such as light absorption, scattering, color casts, and artifacts, making enhancement critical for effective object detection, recognition, and scene understanding in aquatic environments. Existing methods, especially diffusion-based approaches, typically rely on synthetic paired datasets due to the scarcity of real underwater references, introducing bias and limiting generalization. Furthermore, fine-tuning these models can degrade learned priors, resulting in unrealistic enhancements due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we propose UDAN-CLIP, an image-to-image diffusion framework pre-trained on synthetic underwater datasets and enhanced with a customized classifier based on vision-language model, a spatial attention module, and a novel CLIP-Diffusion loss. The classifier preserves natural in-air priors and semantically guides the diffusion process, while the spatial attention module focuses on correcting localized degradations such as haze and low contrast. The proposed CLIP-Diffusion loss further strengthens visual-textual alignment and helps maintain semantic consistency during enhancement. The proposed contributions empower our UDAN-CLIP model to perform more effective underwater image enhancement, producing results that are not only visually compelling but also more realistic and detail-preserving. These improvements are consistently validated through both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual comparisons, demonstrating the model's ability to correct distortions and restore natural appearance in challenging underwater conditions.

arXiv:2505.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have shown promising performance in conventional scenarios. However, these methods still encounter significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range, controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in comparison to existing methods.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in understanding complex real-world scenarios and supporting data-driven decision-making processes. However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack (VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking, hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets.

Abstract: For tasks such as urban digital twins, VR/AR/game scene design, or creating synthetic films, the traditional industrial approach often involves manually modeling scenes and using various rendering engines to complete the rendering process. This approach typically requires high labor costs and hardware demands, and can result in poor quality when replicating complex real-world scenes. A more efficient approach is to use data from captured real-world scenes, then apply reconstruction and rendering algorithms to quickly recreate the authentic scene. However, current algorithms are unable to effectively reconstruct and render real-world weather effects. To address this, we propose a framework based on gaussian splatting, that can reconstruct real scenes and render them under synthesized 4D weather effects. Our work can simulate various common weather effects by applying Gaussians modeling and rendering techniques. It supports continuous dynamic weather changes and can easily control the details of the effects. Additionally, our work has low hardware requirements and achieves real-time rendering performance. The result demos can be accessed on our project homepage: weathermagician.github.io

<title>A Responsible Face Recognition Approach for Small and Mid-Scale Systems Through Personalized Neural Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional face recognition systems rely on extracting fixed face representations, known as templates, to store and verify identities. These representations are typically generated by neural networks that often lack explainability and raise concerns regarding fairness and privacy. In this work, we propose a novel model-template (MOTE) approach that replaces vector-based face templates with small personalized neural networks. This design enables more responsible face recognition for small and medium-scale systems. During enrollment, MOTE creates a dedicated binary classifier for each identity, trained to determine whether an input face matches the enrolled identity. Each classifier is trained using only a single reference sample, along with synthetically balanced samples to allow adjusting fairness at the level of a single individual during enrollment. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and recognition systems demonstrate substantial improvements in fairness and particularly in privacy. Although the method increases inference time and storage requirements, it presents a strong solution for small- and mid-scale applications where fairness and privacy are critical.

Abstract: Audio-visual zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been extensively researched for its capability to classify video data from unseen classes during training. Nevertheless, current methodologies often struggle with background scene biases and inadequate motion detail. This paper proposes a novel dual-stream Multi-Timescale Motion-Decoupled Spiking Transformer (MDST++), which decouples contextual semantic information and sparse dynamic motion information. The recurrent joint learning unit is proposed to extract contextual semantic information and capture joint knowledge across various modalities to understand the environment of actions. By converting RGB images to events, our method captures motion information more accurately and mitigates background scene biases. Moreover, we introduce a discrepancy analysis block to model audio motion information. To enhance the robustness of SNNs in extracting temporal and motion cues, we dynamically adjust the threshold of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons based on global motion and contextual semantic information. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of MDST++, demonstrating their consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods on mainstream benchmarks. Additionally, incorporating motion and multi-timescale information significantly improves HM and ZSL accuracy by 26.2\% and 39.9\%.

Abstract: The diagram is a visual representation of a relationship illustrated with edges (lines or arrows), which is widely used in industrial and scientific communication. Although recognizing diagrams is essential for vision language models (VLMs) to comprehend domain-specific knowledge, recent studies reveal that many VLMs fail to identify edges in images. We hypothesize that these failures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases, preventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we empirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge representation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased neither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct contrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to train an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three tasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the finetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses zero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task. These findings confirm that eliminating textual and positional biases fosters accurate edge recognition in VLMs, offering a promising path for advancing diagram understanding.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful technique for imaging macromolecular complexes in their near-native states. However, the localization of 3D particles in cellular environments still presents a significant challenge due to low signal-to-noise ratios and missing wedge artifacts. Deep learning approaches have shown great potential, but they need huge amounts of data, which can be a challenge in cryo-ET scenarios where labeled data is often scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-augmented and Self-interpreted (SaSi) deep learning approach towards few-shot particle detection in 3D cryo-ET images. Our method builds upon self-augmentation techniques to further boost data utilization and introduces a self-interpreted segmentation strategy for alleviating dependency on labeled data, hence improving generalization and robustness. As demonstrated by experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world cryo-ET datasets, the SaSi approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for particle localization. This research increases understanding of how to detect particles with very few labels in cryo-ET and thus sets a new benchmark for few-shot learning in structural biology.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images given a compositional query, consisting of a reference image and a modifying text-without relying on annotated training data. Existing approaches often generate a synthetic target text using large language models (LLMs) to serve as an intermediate anchor between the compositional query and the target image. Models are then trained to align the compositional query with the generated text, and separately align images with their corresponding texts using contrastive learning. However, this reliance on intermediate text introduces error propagation, as inaccuracies in query-to-text and text-to-image mappings accumulate, ultimately degrading retrieval performance. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework by employing a Multimodal Reasoning Agent (MRA) for ZS-CIR. MRA eliminates the dependence on textual intermediaries by directly constructing triplets, , using only unlabeled image data. By training on these synthetic triplets, our model learns to capture the relationships between compositional queries and candidate images directly. Extensive experiments on three standard CIR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the FashionIQ dataset, our method improves Average R@10 by at least 7.5\% over existing baselines; on CIRR, it boosts R@1 by 9.6\%; and on CIRCO, it increases mAP@5 by 9.5\%.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great potential in generating realistic image detail. However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling. In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos. This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a single sampling step.

<title>PHI: Bridging Domain Shift in Long-Term Action Quality Assessment via Progressive Hierarchical Instruction</title>

Abstract: Long-term Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate the quantitative performance of actions in long videos. However, existing methods face challenges due to domain shifts between the pre-trained large-scale action recognition backbones and the specific AQA task, thereby hindering their performance. This arises since fine-tuning resource-intensive backbones on small AQA datasets is impractical. We address this by identifying two levels of domain shift: task-level, regarding differences in task objectives, and feature-level, regarding differences in important features. For feature-level shifts, which are more detrimental, we propose Progressive Hierarchical Instruction (PHI) with two strategies. First, Gap Minimization Flow (GMF) leverages flow matching to progressively learn a fast flow path that reduces the domain gap between initial and desired features across shallow to deep layers. Additionally, a temporally-enhanced attention module captures long-range dependencies essential for AQA. Second, List-wise Contrastive Regularization (LCR) facilitates coarse-to-fine alignment by comprehensively comparing batch pairs to learn fine-grained cues while mitigating domain shift. Integrating these modules, PHI offers an effective solution. Experiments demonstrate that PHI achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative long-term AQA datasets, proving its superiority in addressing the domain shift for long-term AQA.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) inherently encode strong inductive biases, enabling effective generalization on small-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose integrating this inductive bias into ViTs, not through an architectural intervention but solely through initialization. The motivation here is to have a ViT that can enjoy strong CNN-like performance when data assets are small, but can still scale to ViT-like performance as the data expands. Our approach is motivated by our empirical results that random impulse filters can achieve commensurate performance to learned filters within a CNN. We improve upon current ViT initialization strategies, which typically rely on empirical heuristics such as using attention weights from pretrained models or focusing on the distribution of attention weights without enforcing structures. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms standard ViT initialization across numerous small and medium-scale benchmarks, including Food-101, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Flowers, and Pets, while maintaining comparative performance on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1K. Moreover, our initialization strategy can be easily integrated into various transformer-based architectures such as Swin Transformer and MLP-Mixer with consistent improvements in performance.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a progressive scaling training strategy for visual object tracking, systematically analyzing the influence of training data volume, model size, and input resolution on tracking performance. Our empirical study reveals that while scaling each factor leads to significant improvements in tracking accuracy, naive training suffers from suboptimal optimization and limited iterative refinement. To address this issue, we introduce DT-Training, a progressive scaling framework that integrates small teacher transfer and dual-branch alignment to maximize model potential. The resulting scaled tracker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and transferability of the proposed method. Furthermore, we validate the broader applicability of our approach to additional tasks, underscoring its versatility beyond tracking.

<title>NEXT: Multi-Grained Mixture of Experts via Text-Modulation for Multi-Modal Object Re-ID</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal object re-identification (ReID) aims to extract identity features across heterogeneous spectral modalities to enable accurate recognition and retrieval in complex real-world scenarios. However, most existing methods rely on implicit feature fusion structures, making it difficult to model fine-grained recognition strategies under varying challenging conditions. Benefiting from the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the visual appearance of an object can be effectively translated into descriptive text. In this paper, we propose a reliable multi-modal caption generation method based on attribute confidence, which significantly reduces the unknown recognition rate of MLLMs in multi-modal semantic generation and improves the quality of generated text. Additionally, we propose a novel ReID framework NEXT, the Multi-grained Mixture of Experts via Text-Modulation for Multi-modal Object Re-Identification. Specifically, we decouple the recognition problem into semantic and structural expert branches to separately capture modality-specific appearance and intrinsic structure. For semantic recognition, we propose the Text-Modulated Semantic-sampling Experts (TMSE), which leverages randomly sampled high-quality semantic texts to modulate expert-specific sampling of multi-modal features and mining intra-modality fine-grained semantic cues. Then, to recognize coarse-grained structure features, we propose the Context-Shared Structure-aware Experts (CSSE) that focuses on capturing the holistic object structure across modalities and maintains inter-modality structural consistency through a soft routing mechanism. Finally, we propose the Multi-Modal Feature Aggregation (MMFA), which adopts a unified feature fusion strategy to simply and effectively integrate semantic and structural expert outputs into the final identity representations.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal comprehension and reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with trivially simple visual tasks. In this work, we focus on the domain of basic 2D Euclidean geometry and systematically categorize the fundamental, indivisible visual perception skills, which we refer to as atomic visual skills. We then introduce the Atomic Visual Skills Dataset (AVSD) for evaluating VLMs on the atomic visual skills. Using AVSD, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs and find that they struggle with these tasks, despite being trivial for adult humans. Our findings highlight the need for purpose-built datasets to train and evaluate VLMs on atomic, rather than composite, visual perception tasks.

Abstract: Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset, namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of 19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark, highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases. Code and dataset will be found in https://github.com/Liuxueyi/ReasonPlan.

<title>ViTaPEs: Visuotactile Position Encodings for Cross-Modal Alignment in Multimodal Transformers</title>

Abstract: Tactile sensing provides local essential information that is complementary to visual perception, such as texture, compliance, and force. Despite recent advances in visuotactile representation learning, challenges remain in fusing these modalities and generalizing across tasks and environments without heavy reliance on pre-trained vision-language models. Moreover, existing methods do not study positional encodings, thereby overlooking the multi-scale spatial reasoning needed to capture fine-grained visuotactile correlations. We introduce ViTaPEs, a transformer-based framework that robustly integrates visual and tactile input data to learn task-agnostic representations for visuotactile perception. Our approach exploits a novel multi-scale positional encoding scheme to capture intra-modal structures, while simultaneously modeling cross-modal cues. Unlike prior work, we provide provable guarantees in visuotactile fusion, showing that our encodings are injective, rigid-motion-equivariant, and information-preserving, validating these properties empirically. Experiments on multiple large-scale real-world datasets show that ViTaPEs not only surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across various recognition tasks but also demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen, out-of-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the transfer-learning strength of ViTaPEs in a robotic grasping task, where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predicting grasp success.

Abstract: Effective human-AI interaction relies on AI's ability to accurately perceive and interpret human emotions. Current benchmarks for vision and vision-language models are severely limited, offering a narrow emotional spectrum that overlooks nuanced states (e.g., bitterness, intoxication) and fails to distinguish subtle differences between related feelings (e.g., shame vs. embarrassment). Existing datasets also often use uncontrolled imagery with occluded faces and lack demographic diversity, risking significant bias. To address these critical gaps, we introduce EmoNet Face, a comprehensive benchmark suite. EmoNet Face features: (1) A novel 40-category emotion taxonomy, meticulously derived from foundational research to capture finer details of human emotional experiences. (2) Three large-scale, AI-generated datasets (EmoNet HQ, Binary, and Big) with explicit, full-face expressions and controlled demographic balance across ethnicity, age, and gender. (3) Rigorous, multi-expert annotations for training and high-fidelity evaluation. (4) We build Empathic Insight Face, a model achieving human-expert-level performance on our benchmark. The publicly released EmoNet Face suite - taxonomy, datasets, and model - provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating AI systems with a deeper understanding of human emotions.

Abstract: RGB-D scene parsing methods effectively capture both semantic and geometric features of the environment, demonstrating great potential under challenging conditions such as extreme weather and low lighting. However, existing RGB-D scene parsing methods predominantly rely on supervised training strategies, which require a large amount of manually annotated pixel-level labels that are both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DepthMatch, a semi-supervised learning framework that is specifically designed for RGB-D scene parsing. To make full use of unlabeled data, we propose complementary patch mix-up augmentation to explore the latent relationships between texture and spatial features in RGB-D image pairs. We also design a lightweight spatial prior injector to replace traditional complex fusion modules, improving the efficiency of heterogeneous feature fusion. Furthermore, we introduce depth-guided boundary loss to enhance the model's boundary prediction capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DepthMatch exhibits high applicability in both indoor and outdoor scenes, achieving state-of-the-art results on the NYUv2 dataset and ranking first on the KITTI Semantics benchmark.

<title>Data-Free Class-Incremental Gesture Recognition with Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20049</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gesture recognition is an important research area in the field of computer vision. Most gesture recognition efforts focus on close-set scenarios, thereby limiting the capacity to effectively handle unseen or novel gestures. We aim to address class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to accommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we introduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for data-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four components: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP), Variational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy (TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle the issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a diversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes of old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore, the VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the prototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices to enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the impact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features. Finally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new classes and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition datasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\% and 12.8\% in terms of mean global accuracy, respectively. The code is available on https://github.com/sunao-101/PGPFR-3/.

<title>Multimodal LLM-Guided Semantic Correction in Text-to-Image Diffusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20053</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.

Abstract: Computational dance generation is crucial in many areas, such as art, human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and digital entertainment, particularly for generating coherent and expressive long dance sequences. Diffusion-based music-to-dance generation has made significant progress, yet existing methods still struggle to produce physically plausible motions. To address this, we propose Plausibility-Aware Motion Diffusion (PAMD), a framework for generating dances that are both musically aligned and physically realistic. The core of PAMD lies in the Plausible Motion Constraint (PMC), which leverages Neural Distance Fields (NDFs) to model the actual pose manifold and guide generated motions toward a physically valid pose manifold. To provide more effective guidance during generation, we incorporate Prior Motion Guidance (PMG), which uses standing poses as auxiliary conditions alongside music features. To further enhance realism for complex movements, we introduce the Motion Refinement with Foot-ground Contact (MRFC) module, which addresses foot-skating artifacts by bridging the gap between the optimization objective in linear joint position space and the data representation in nonlinear rotation space. Extensive experiments show that PAMD significantly improves musical alignment and enhances the physical plausibility of generated motions.

Abstract: Monocular 3D hand mesh recovery is challenging due to high degrees of freedom of hands, 2D-to-3D ambiguity and self-occlusion. Most existing methods are either inefficient or less straightforward for predicting the position of 3D mesh vertices. Thus, we propose a new pipeline called Monocular 3D Hand Mesh Recovery (M3DHMR) to directly estimate the positions of hand mesh vertices. M3DHMR provides 2D cues for 3D tasks from a single image and uses a new spiral decoder consist of several Dynamic Spiral Convolution (DSC) Layers and a Region of Interest (ROI) Layer. On the one hand, DSC Layers adaptively adjust the weights based on the vertex positions and extract the vertex features in both spatial and channel dimensions. On the other hand, ROI Layer utilizes the physical information and refines mesh vertices in each predefined hand region separately. Extensive experiments on popular dataset FreiHAND demonstrate that M3DHMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art real-time methods.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in video understanding tasks. However, they often suffer from heavy computational overhead due to the large number of visual tokens generated from multiple video frames. Existing visual token compression methods often rely on attention scores from language models as guidance. However, these scores exhibit inherent biases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual token sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same spatial positions across different frames. To address the issue of attention bias, we propose $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{D}$ebi$\textbf{a}$sed $\textbf{T}$oken $\textbf{P}$runing for Video Large Language Models ($\textbf{AdaTP}$), a novel token pruning pipeline for Video LLMs. AdaTP integrates two dedicated debiasing modules into the pipeline, targeting global attention bias and local attention bias, respectively. Without the need for additional training, our method significantly reduces the computational overhead of Video LLMs while retaining the performance of vanilla models. Extensive evaluation shows that AdaTP achieves state-of-the-art performance in various commonly used video understanding benchmarks. In particular, on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, AdaTP maintains performance without degradation while using only up to $27.3\%$ FLOPs compared to the vanilla model. Our code will be released soon.

<title>From Data to Modeling: Fully Open-vocabulary Scene Graph Generation</title>

Abstract: We present OvSGTR, a novel transformer-based framework for fully open-vocabulary scene graph generation that overcomes the limitations of traditional closed-set models. Conventional methods restrict both object and relationship recognition to a fixed vocabulary, hindering their applicability to real-world scenarios where novel concepts frequently emerge. In contrast, our approach jointly predicts objects (nodes) and their inter-relationships (edges) beyond predefined categories. OvSGTR leverages a DETR-like architecture featuring a frozen image backbone and text encoder to extract high-quality visual and semantic features, which are then fused via a transformer decoder for end-to-end scene graph prediction. To enrich the model's understanding of complex visual relations, we propose a relation-aware pre-training strategy that synthesizes scene graph annotations in a weakly supervised manner. Specifically, we investigate three pipelines--scene parser-based, LLM-based, and multimodal LLM-based--to generate transferable supervision signals with minimal manual annotation. Furthermore, we address the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in open-vocabulary settings by incorporating a visual-concept retention mechanism coupled with a knowledge distillation strategy, ensuring that the model retains rich semantic cues during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on the VG150 benchmark demonstrate that OvSGTR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings, including closed-set, open-vocabulary object detection-based, relation-based, and fully open-vocabulary scenarios. Our results highlight the promise of large-scale relation-aware pre-training and transformer architectures for advancing scene graph generation towards more generalized and reliable visual understanding.

Abstract: Videos are unique in their integration of temporal elements, including camera, scene, action, and attribute, along with their dynamic relationships over time. However, existing benchmarks for video understanding often treat these properties separately or narrowly focus on specific aspects, overlooking the holistic nature of video content. To address this, we introduce TUNA, a temporal-oriented benchmark for fine-grained understanding on dense dynamic videos, with two complementary tasks: captioning and QA. Our TUNA features diverse video scenarios and dynamics, assisted by interpretable and robust evaluation criteria. We evaluate several leading models on our benchmark, providing fine-grained performance assessments across various dimensions. This evaluation reveals key challenges in video temporal understanding, such as limited action description, inadequate multi-subject understanding, and insensitivity to camera motion, offering valuable insights for improving video understanding models. The data and code are available at https://friedrichor.github.io/projects/TUNA.

Abstract: Recent advancements in radiance field rendering, exemplified by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have significantly progressed 3D modeling and reconstruction. The use of multiple 360-degree omnidirectional images for these tasks is increasingly favored due to advantages in data acquisition and comprehensive scene capture. However, the inherent geometric distortions in common omnidirectional representations, such as equirectangular projection (particularly severe in polar regions and varying with latitude), pose substantial challenges to achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Current datasets, while valuable, often lack the specific focus, scene composition, and ground truth granularity required to systematically benchmark and drive progress in overcoming these omnidirectional-specific challenges. To address this critical gap, we introduce Omnidirectional Blender 3D (OB3D), a new synthetic dataset curated for advancing 3D reconstruction from multiple omnidirectional images. OB3D features diverse and complex 3D scenes generated from Blender 3D projects, with a deliberate emphasis on challenging scenarios. The dataset provides comprehensive ground truth, including omnidirectional RGB images, precise omnidirectional camera parameters, and pixel-aligned equirectangular maps for depth and normals, alongside evaluation metrics. By offering a controlled yet challenging environment, OB3Daims to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of existing methods and prompt the development of new techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of 3D reconstruction from omnidirectional images.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Benefiting from contrastively trained visual encoders on large-scale natural scene images, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various visual perception tasks. However, the inherent limitations of contrastive learning upon summarized descriptions fundamentally restrict the capabilities of models in meticulous reasoning, particularly in crucial scenarios of geometric problem-solving. To enhance geometric understanding, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code, and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on caption similarity. We train CLIP using our strong negative learning method, namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM, significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models like GPT-4o. We further study the impact of different negative sample construction methods and the number of negative samples on the geometric reasoning performance of LMM, yielding fruitful conclusions. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/MMGeoLM.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in audio-driven human animation. However, critical challenges remain in (i) generating highly dynamic videos while preserving character consistency, (ii) achieving precise emotion alignment between characters and audio, and (iii) enabling multi-character audio-driven animation. To address these challenges, we propose HunyuanVideo-Avatar, a multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT)-based model capable of simultaneously generating dynamic, emotion-controllable, and multi-character dialogue videos. Concretely, HunyuanVideo-Avatar introduces three key innovations: (i) A character image injection module is designed to replace the conventional addition-based character conditioning scheme, eliminating the inherent condition mismatch between training and inference. This ensures the dynamic motion and strong character consistency; (ii) An Audio Emotion Module (AEM) is introduced to extract and transfer the emotional cues from an emotion reference image to the target generated video, enabling fine-grained and accurate emotion style control; (iii) A Face-Aware Audio Adapter (FAA) is proposed to isolate the audio-driven character with latent-level face mask, enabling independent audio injection via cross-attention for multi-character scenarios. These innovations empower HunyuanVideo-Avatar to surpass state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and a newly proposed wild dataset, generating realistic avatars in dynamic, immersive scenarios.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently shown promise for world modeling through autoregressive frame prediction conditioned on actions. However, they struggle to maintain long-term memory due to the high computational cost associated with processing extended sequences in attention layers. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel architecture leveraging state-space models (SSMs) to extend temporal memory without compromising computational efficiency. Unlike previous approaches that retrofit SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, our method fully exploits the inherent advantages of SSMs in causal sequence modeling. Central to our design is a block-wise SSM scanning scheme, which strategically trades off spatial consistency for extended temporal memory, combined with dense local attention to ensure coherence between consecutive frames. We evaluate the long-term memory capabilities of our model through spatial retrieval and reasoning tasks over extended horizons. Experiments on Memory Maze and Minecraft datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses baselines in preserving long-range memory, while maintaining practical inference speeds suitable for interactive applications.

Abstract: The emergence of pathology foundation models has revolutionized computational histopathology, enabling highly accurate, generalized whole-slide image analysis for improved cancer diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. While these models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics, their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data, enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for assessing the reliability and trustworthiness of modern AI systems. Among existing approaches, verbalized uncertainty, where models express their confidence through natural language, has emerged as a lightweight and interpretable solution in large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs) remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of verbalized confidence in VLMs, spanning three model categories, four task domains, and three evaluation scenarios. Our results show that current VLMs often display notable miscalibration across diverse tasks and settings. Notably, visual reasoning models (i.e., thinking with images) consistently exhibit better calibration, suggesting that modality-specific reasoning is critical for reliable uncertainty estimation. To further address calibration challenges, we introduce Visual Confidence-Aware Prompting, a two-stage prompting strategy that improves confidence alignment in multimodal settings. Overall, our study highlights the inherent miscalibration in VLMs across modalities. More broadly, our findings underscore the fundamental importance of modality alignment and model faithfulness in advancing reliable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly improved character animation techniques. However, current approaches rely on basic structural conditions such as DWPose or SMPL-X to animate character images, limiting their effectiveness in open-domain scenarios with dynamic backgrounds or challenging human poses. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{AniCrafter}$, a diffusion-based human-centric animation model that can seamlessly integrate and animate a given character into open-domain dynamic backgrounds while following given human motion sequences. Built on cutting-edge Image-to-Video (I2V) diffusion architectures, our model incorporates an innovative "avatar-background" conditioning mechanism that reframes open-domain human-centric animation as a restoration task, enabling more stable and versatile animation outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Codes will be available at https://github.com/MyNiuuu/AniCrafter.

<title>Omni-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Omnimodal Reasoning via Two-System Collaboration</title>

arXiv:2505.20256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon video-audio reasoning and fine-grained pixel understanding impose conflicting requirements on omnimodal models: dense temporal coverage demands many low-resolution frames, whereas precise grounding calls for high-resolution inputs. We tackle this trade-off with a two-system architecture: a Global Reasoning System selects informative keyframes and rewrites the task at low spatial cost, while a Detail Understanding System performs pixel-level grounding on the selected high-resolution snippets. Because ``optimal'' keyframe selection and reformulation are ambiguous and hard to supervise, we formulate them as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and present Omni-R1, an end-to-end RL framework built on Group Relative Policy Optimization. Omni-R1 trains the Global Reasoning System through hierarchical rewards obtained via online collaboration with the Detail Understanding System, requiring only one epoch of RL on small task splits.
  Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, namely Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (RefAVS) and Reasoning Video Object Segmentation (REVOS), show that Omni-R1 not only surpasses strong supervised baselines but also outperforms specialized state-of-the-art models, while substantially improving out-of-domain generalization and mitigating multimodal hallucination. Our results demonstrate the first successful application of RL to large-scale omnimodal reasoning and highlight a scalable path toward universally foundation models.

Abstract: High fidelity 3D reconstruction and rendering hinge on capturing precise geometry while preserving photo realistic detail. Most existing methods either fuse these goals into a single cumbersome model or adopt hybrid schemes whose uniform primitives lead to a trade off between efficiency and fidelity. In this paper, we introduce HaloGS, a dual representation that loosely couples coarse triangles for geometry with Gaussian primitives for appearance, motivated by the lightweight classic geometry representations and their proven efficiency in real world applications. Our design yields a compact yet expressive model capable of photo realistic rendering across both indoor and outdoor environments, seamlessly adapting to varying levels of scene complexity. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method yields both compact, accurate geometry and high fidelity renderings, especially in challenging scenarios where robust geometric structure make a clear difference.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to model the dynamics of 3D Gaussians from visual observations to support temporal extrapolation. Existing dynamic 3D reconstruction methods often struggle to effectively learn underlying dynamics or rely heavily on manually defined physical priors, which limits their extrapolation capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting prior-free motion extrapolation framework based on particle dynamics systems. The core advantage of our method lies in its ability to learn differential equations that describe the dynamics of 3D Gaussians, and follow them during future frame extrapolation. Instead of simply fitting to the observed visual frame sequence, we aim to more effectively model the gaussian particle dynamics system. To this end, we introduce a dynamics latent state vector into the standard Gaussian kernel and design a dynamics latent space encoder to extract initial state. Subsequently, we introduce a Neural ODEs-based dynamics module that models the temporal evolution of Gaussian in dynamics latent space. Finally, a Gaussian kernel space decoder is used to decode latent state at the specific time step into the deformation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable rendering quality with existing approaches in reconstruction tasks, and significantly outperforms them in future frame extrapolation. Our code is available at https://github.com/QuanJinSheng/ParticleGS.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enhanced multimodal-guided visual generation, enabling customized subject insertion that seamlessly "brushes" user-specified objects into a given image guided by textual prompts. However, existing methods often struggle to insert customized subjects with high fidelity and align results with the user's intent through textual prompts. In this work, we propose "In-Context Brush", a zero-shot framework for customized subject insertion by reformulating the task within the paradigm of in-context learning. Without loss of generality, we formulate the object image and the textual prompts as cross-modal demonstrations, and the target image with the masked region as the query. The goal is to inpaint the target image with the subject aligning textual prompts without model tuning. Building upon a pretrained MMDiT-based inpainting network, we perform test-time enhancement via dual-level latent space manipulation: intra-head "latent feature shifting" within each attention head that dynamically shifts attention outputs to reflect the desired subject semantics and inter-head "attention reweighting" across different heads that amplifies prompt controllability through differential attention prioritization. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate that our approach achieves superior identity preservation, text alignment, and image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring dedicated training or additional data collection.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive general capabilities across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. However, the reasoning processes of LVLMs often suffer from unreliable outputs and limited interpretability. To address this, grounded visual reasoning has emerged as a promising paradigm that enforces responses anchored on salient visual evidence regions. However, existing approaches typically rely on costly supervision such as bounding box annotations, chain-of-thought rationale or external tool calls, limiting their scalability. In this work, we propose Ground-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enables grounded visual reasoning without requiring explicit evidence or rationale annotations. Ground-R1 consists of a grounding phase that generates evidence region rollouts based on format constraints, and an answering phase that produces responses guided by both answer correctness and format adherence rewards. Extensive experiments across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks manifest that Ground-R1 achieves superior performance and exhibits emergent cognitive behaviors such as uncertainty awareness, spatial perception, and iterative refinement, offering a scalable and interpretable alternative to existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled high-fidelity text-to-image generation. However, open-source image-editing models still lag behind their proprietary counterparts, primarily due to limited high-quality data and insufficient benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ImgEdit, a large-scale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2 million carefully curated edit pairs, which contain both novel and complex single-turn edits, as well as challenging multi-turn tasks. To ensure the data quality, we employ a multi-stage pipeline that integrates a cutting-edge vision-language model, a detection model, a segmentation model, alongside task-specific in-painting procedures and strict post-processing. ImgEdit surpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality. Using ImgEdit, we train ImgEdit-E1, an editing model using Vision Language Model to process the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing open-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and model design. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ImgEdit-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation. It includes a basic testsuite, a challenging single-turn suite, and a dedicated multi-turn suite. We evaluate both open-source and proprietary models, as well as ImgEdit-E1, providing deep analysis and actionable insights into the current behavior of image-editing models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and videos has motivated extending these models to understand 3D scenes, aiming for human-like visual-spatial intelligence. Nevertheless, achieving deep spatial understanding comparable to human capabilities poses significant challenges in model encoding and data acquisition. Existing methods frequently depend on external depth sensors for geometry capture or utilize off-the-shelf algorithms for pre-constructing 3D maps, thereby limiting their scalability, especially with prevalent monocular video inputs and for time-sensitive applications. In this work, we introduce VLM-3R, a unified framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that incorporates 3D Reconstructive instruction tuning. VLM-3R processes monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D tokens that represent spatial understanding. Leveraging our Spatial-Visual-View Fusion and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning question-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial context with language instructions. This enables monocular 3D spatial assistance and embodied reasoning. To facilitate the evaluation of temporal reasoning, we introduce the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence benchmark, featuring over 138.6K QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving spatial relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, VLM-3R, not only facilitates robust visual-spatial reasoning but also enables the understanding of temporal 3D context changes, excelling in both accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: The motion of deformable 4D objects lies in a low-dimensional manifold. To better capture the low dimensionality and enable better controllability, traditional methods have devised several heuristic-based methods, i.e., rigging, for manipulating dynamic objects in an intuitive fashion. However, such representations are not scalable due to the need for expert knowledge of specific categories. Instead, we study the automatic exploration of such low-dimensional structures in a purely data-driven manner. Specifically, we design a novel representation that encodes deformable 4D objects into a sparse set of spatially grounded blobs and an instance-aware feature volume to disentangle the pose and instance information of the 3D shape. With such a representation, we can manipulate the pose of 3D objects intuitively by modifying the parameters of the blobs, while preserving rich instance-specific information. We evaluate the proposed method on a variety of object categories and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Project page: https://guangzhaohe.com/canor

Abstract: Animating images with interactive motion control has garnered popularity for image-to-video (I2V) generation. Modern approaches typically rely on large Gaussian kernels to extend motion trajectories as condition without explicitly defining movement region, leading to coarse motion control and failing to disentangle object and camera moving. To alleviate these, we present MotionPro, a precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and motion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target motion category (i.e., object or camera moving), respectively. Technically, MotionPro first estimates the flow maps on each training video via a tracking model, and then samples the region-wise trajectories to simulate inference scenario. Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels, our region-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly utilizing trajectories within local regions, thereby effectively characterizing fine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the predicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement regions. To pursue natural motion control, MotionPro further strengthens video denoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask through feature modulation. More remarkably, we meticulously construct a benchmark, i.e., MC-Bench, with 1.1K user-annotated image-trajectory pairs, for the evaluation of both fine-grained and object-level I2V motion control. Extensive experiments conducted on WebVid-10M and MC-Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of MotionPro. Please refer to our project page for more results: https://zhw-zhang.github.io/MotionPro-page/.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful generative paradigm for visual generation. The current de-facto standard of next token prediction commonly operates over a single-scale sequence of dense image tokens, and is incapable of utilizing global context especially for early tokens prediction. In this paper, we introduce a new autoregressive design to model a hierarchy from a few low-resolution image tokens to the typical dense image tokens, and delve into a thorough hierarchical dependency across multi-scale image tokens. Technically, we present a Hierarchical Masked Autoregressive models (Hi-MAR) that pivot on low-resolution image tokens to trigger hierarchical autoregressive modeling in a multi-phase manner. Hi-MAR learns to predict a few image tokens in low resolution, functioning as intermediary pivots to reflect global structure, in the first phase. Such pivots act as the additional guidance to strengthen the next autoregressive modeling phase by shaping global structural awareness of typical dense image tokens. A new Diffusion Transformer head is further devised to amplify the global context among all tokens for mask token prediction. Extensive evaluations on both class-conditional and text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that Hi-MAR outperforms typical AR baselines, while requiring fewer computational costs.

Abstract: We introduce VisTA, a new reinforcement learning framework that empowers visual agents to dynamically explore, select, and combine tools from a diverse library based on empirical performance. Existing methods for tool-augmented reasoning either rely on training-free prompting or large-scale fine-tuning; both lack active tool exploration and typically assume limited tool diversity, and fine-tuning methods additionally demand extensive human supervision. In contrast, VisTA leverages end-to-end reinforcement learning to iteratively refine sophisticated, query-specific tool selection strategies, using task outcomes as feedback signals. Through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our framework enables an agent to autonomously discover effective tool-selection pathways without requiring explicit reasoning supervision. Experiments on the ChartQA, Geometry3K, and BlindTest benchmarks demonstrate that VisTA achieves substantial performance gains over training-free baselines, especially on out-of-distribution examples. These results highlight VisTA's ability to enhance generalization, adaptively utilize diverse tools, and pave the way for flexible, experience-driven visual reasoning systems.

Abstract: We propose Visualize-then-Retrieve (VisRet), a new paradigm for Text-to-Image (T2I) retrieval that mitigates the limitations of cross-modal similarity alignment of existing multi-modal embeddings. VisRet first projects textual queries into the image modality via T2I generation. Then, it performs retrieval within the image modality to bypass the weaknesses of cross-modal retrievers in recognizing subtle visual-spatial features. Experiments on three knowledge-intensive T2I retrieval benchmarks, including a newly introduced multi-entity benchmark, demonstrate that VisRet consistently improves T2I retrieval by 24.5% to 32.7% NDCG@10 across different embedding models. VisRet also significantly benefits downstream visual question answering accuracy when used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines. The method is plug-and-play and compatible with off-the-shelf retrievers, making it an effective module for knowledge-intensive multi-modal systems. Our code and the new benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/xiaowu0162/Visualize-then-Retrieve.

Abstract: Subject-to-Video (S2V) generation aims to create videos that faithfully incorporate reference content, providing enhanced flexibility in the production of videos. To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and (ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data. Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16 representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.

Abstract: Generalizable active mapping in complex unknown environments remains a critical challenge for mobile robots. Existing methods, constrained by insufficient training data and conservative exploration strategies, exhibit limited generalizability across scenes with diverse layouts and complex connectivity. To enable scalable training and reliable evaluation, we introduce GLEAM-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for generalizable active mapping with 1,152 diverse 3D scenes from synthetic and real-scan datasets. Building upon this foundation, we propose GLEAM, a unified generalizable exploration policy for active mapping. Its superior generalizability comes mainly from our semantic representations, long-term navigable goals, and randomized strategies. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 66.50% coverage (+9.49%) with efficient trajectories and improved mapping accuracy on 128 unseen complex scenes.

<title>DiSA: Diffusion Step Annealing in Autoregressive Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20297</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: An increasing number of autoregressive models, such as MAR, FlowAR, xAR, and Harmon adopt diffusion sampling to improve the quality of image generation. However, this strategy leads to low inference efficiency, because it usually takes 50 to 100 steps for diffusion to sample a token. This paper explores how to effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens are generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more constrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if a model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog and thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at later generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer perceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising paths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step annealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion steps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and gradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from our finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary to existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be implemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple, achieves $5-10\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\times$ for FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality.

Abstract: Electroencephalography-based Emotion Recognition (EEG-ER) has become a growing research area in recent years. Analyzing 216 papers published between 2018 and 2023, we uncover that the field lacks a unified evaluation protocol, which is essential to fairly define the state of the art, compare new approaches and to track the field's progress. We report the main inconsistencies between the used evaluation protocols, which are related to ground truth definition, evaluation metric selection, data splitting types (e.g., subject-dependent or subject-independent) and the use of different datasets. Capitalizing on this state-of-the-art research, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, EEGain (https://github.com/EmotionLab/EEGain), which enables an easy and efficient evaluation of new methods and datasets. EEGain is a novel open source software framework, offering the capability to compare - and thus define - state-of-the-art results. EEGain includes standardized methods for data pre-processing, data splitting, evaluation metrics, and the ability to load the six most relevant datasets (i.e., AMIGOS, DEAP, DREAMER, MAHNOB-HCI, SEED, SEED-IV) in EEG-ER with only a single line of code. In addition, we have assessed and validated EEGain using these six datasets on the four most common publicly available methods (EEGNet, DeepConvNet, ShallowConvNet, TSception). This is a significant step to make research on EEG-ER more reproducible and comparable, thereby accelerating the overall progress of the field.

Abstract: The increase in cardiac and pulmonary diseases presents an alarming and pervasive health challenge on a global scale responsible for unexpected and premature mortalities. In spite of how serious these conditions are, existing methods of detection and treatment encounter challenges, particularly in achieving timely diagnosis for effective medical intervention. Manual screening processes commonly used for primary detection of cardiac and respiratory problems face inherent limitations, increased by a scarcity of skilled medical practitioners in remote or under-resourced areas. To address this, our study introduces an innovative yet efficient model which integrates AI for diagnosing lung and heart conditions concurrently using the auscultation sounds. Unlike the already high-priced digital stethoscope, our proposed model has been particularly designed to deploy on low-cost embedded devices and thus ensure applicability in under-developed regions that actually face an issue of accessing medical care. Our proposed model incorporates MFCC feature extraction and engineering techniques to ensure that the signal is well analyzed for accurate diagnostics through the hybrid model combining Gated Recurrent Unit with CNN in processing audio signals recorded from the low-cost stethoscope. Beyond its diagnostic capabilities, the model generates digital audio records that facilitate in classifying six pulmonary and five cardiovascular diseases. Hence, the integration of a cost effective stethoscope with an efficient AI empowered model deployed on a web app providing real-time analysis, represents a transformative step towards standardized healthcare

<title>Large Language Model-Driven Distributed Integrated Multimodal Sensing and Semantic Communications</title>

Abstract: Traditional single-modal sensing systems-based solely on either radio frequency (RF) or visual data-struggle to cope with the demands of complex and dynamic environments. Furthermore, single-device systems are constrained by limited perspectives and insufficient spatial coverage, which impairs their effectiveness in urban or non-line-of-sight scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-driven distributed integrated multimodal sensing and semantic communication (LLM-DiSAC) framework. Specifically, our system consists of multiple collaborative sensing devices equipped with RF and camera modules, working together with an aggregation center to enhance sensing accuracy. First, on sensing devices, LLM-DiSAC develops an RF-vision fusion network (RVFN), which employs specialized feature extractors for RF and visual data, followed by a cross-attention module for effective multimodal integration. Second, a LLM-based semantic transmission network (LSTN) is proposed to enhance communication efficiency, where the LLM-based decoder leverages known channel parameters, such as transceiver distance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to mitigate semantic distortion. Third, at the aggregation center, a transformer-based aggregation model (TRAM) with an adaptive aggregation attention mechanism is developed to fuse distributed features and enhance sensing accuracy. To preserve data privacy, a two-stage distributed learning strategy is introduced, allowing local model training at the device level and centralized aggregation model training using intermediate features. Finally, evaluations on a synthetic multi-view RF-visual dataset generated by the Genesis simulation engine show that LLM-DiSAC achieves a good performance.

<title>Brightness-Invariant Tracking Estimation in Tagged MRI</title>

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is an imaging technique for noninvasively tracking tissue motion in vivo by creating a visible pattern of magnetization saturation (tags) that deforms with the tissue. Due to longitudinal relaxation and progression to steady-state, the tags and tissue brightnesses change over time, which makes tracking with optical flow methods error-prone. Although Fourier methods can alleviate these problems, they are also sensitive to brightness changes as well as spectral spreading due to motion. To address these problems, we introduce the brightness-invariant tracking estimation (BRITE) technique for tagged MRI. BRITE disentangles the anatomy from the tag pattern in the observed tagged image sequence and simultaneously estimates the Lagrangian motion. The inherent ill-posedness of this problem is addressed by leveraging the expressive power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models to represent the probabilistic distribution of the underlying anatomy and the flexibility of physics-informed neural networks to estimate biologically-plausible motion. A set of tagged MR images of a gel phantom was acquired with various tag periods and imaging flip angles to demonstrate the impact of brightness variations and to validate our method. The results show that BRITE achieves more accurate motion and strain estimates as compared to other state of the art methods, while also being resistant to tag fading.

Abstract: Modern foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and large multi-modal models (LMMs) require a massive amount of computational and memory resources. We propose a new framework to convert such LLMs/LMMs into a reduced-dimension latent structure. Our method extends a local activation-aware tensor decomposition to a global attention-aware joint tensor de-composition. Our framework can significantly improve the model accuracy over the existing model compression methods when reducing the latent dimension to realize computationally/memory-efficient LLMs/LLMs. We show the benefit on several benchmark including multi-modal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate identification of stroke lesion boundaries is critical for diagnosis and treatment. Supervised deep learning methods have emerged as the leading solution for stroke lesion segmentation but require large, diverse, and annotated datasets. The ISLES'24 challenge addresses this need by providing longitudinal stroke imaging data, including CT scans taken on arrival to the hospital and follow-up MRI taken 2-9 days from initial arrival, with annotations derived from follow-up MRI. Importantly, models submitted to the ISLES'24 challenge are evaluated using only CT inputs, requiring prediction of lesion progression that may not be visible in CT scans for segmentation. Our winning solution shows that a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline including deep-learning-based skull stripping and custom intensity windowing is beneficial for accurate segmentation. Combined with a standard large residual nnU-Net architecture for segmentation, this approach achieves a mean test Dice of 28.5 with a standard deviation of 21.27.

Abstract: Learning effective visual representations for robotic manipulation remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex body dynamics involved in action execution. In this paper, we study how visual representations that carry body-relevant cues can enable efficient policy learning for downstream robotic manipulation tasks. We present $\textbf{I}$nter-token $\textbf{Con}$trast ($\textbf{ICon}$), a contrastive learning method applied to the token-level representations of Vision Transformers (ViTs). ICon enforces a separation in the feature space between agent-specific and environment-specific tokens, resulting in agent-centric visual representations that embed body-specific inductive biases. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into end-to-end policy learning by incorporating the contrastive loss as an auxiliary objective. Our experiments show that ICon not only improves policy performance across various manipulation tasks but also facilitates policy transfer across different robots.

Abstract: Training multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that align with human intentions is a long-term challenge. Traditional score-only reward models for alignment suffer from low accuracy, weak generalization, and poor interpretability, blocking the progress of alignment methods, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Generative reward models (GRMs) leverage MLLMs' intrinsic reasoning capabilities to discriminate pair-wise responses, but their pair-wise paradigm makes it hard to generalize to learnable rewards. We introduce Generative RLHF-V, a novel alignment framework that integrates GRMs with multi-modal RLHF. We propose a two-stage pipeline: $\textbf{multi-modal generative reward modeling from RL}$, where RL guides GRMs to actively capture human intention, then predict the correct pair-wise scores; and $\textbf{RL optimization from grouped comparison}$, which enhances multi-modal RL scoring precision by grouped responses comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that, besides out-of-distribution generalization of RM discrimination, our framework improves 4 MLLMs' performance across 7 benchmarks by $18.1\%$, while the baseline RLHF is only $5.3\%$. We further validate that Generative RLHF-V achieves a near-linear improvement with an increasing number of candidate responses. Our code and models can be found at https://generative-rlhf-v.github.io.

Abstract: Standing in 2025, at a critical juncture in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) and has led to the development of cutting-edge AI models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Moreover, the efficient application of RFT to enhance the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has attracted widespread attention from the community. In this position paper, we argue that reinforcement fine-tuning powers the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models. To begin with, we provide a detailed introduction to the fundamental background knowledge that researchers interested in this field should be familiar with. Furthermore, we meticulously summarize the improvements of RFT in powering reasoning capability of MLLMs into five key points: diverse modalities, diverse tasks and domains, better training algorithms, abundant benchmarks and thriving engineering frameworks. Finally, we propose five promising directions for future research that the community might consider. We hope that this position paper will provide valuable insights to the community at this pivotal stage in the advancement toward AGI.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical indicator of soil health, but its accurate estimation from satellite imagery is hindered in vegetated regions due to spectral contamination from plant cover, which obscures soil reflectance and reduces model reliability. This study proposes the Reflectance Transformation Generative Adversarial Network (ReflectGAN), a novel paired GAN-based framework designed to reconstruct accurate bare soil reflectance from vegetated soil satellite observations. By learning the spectral transformation between vegetated and bare soil reflectance, ReflectGAN facilitates more precise SOC estimation under mixed land cover conditions. Using the LUCAS 2018 dataset and corresponding Landsat 8 imagery, we trained multiple learning-based models on both original and ReflectGAN-reconstructed reflectance inputs. Models trained on ReflectGAN outputs consistently outperformed those using existing vegetation correction methods. For example, the best-performing model (RF) achieved an $R^2$ of 0.54, RMSE of 3.95, and RPD of 2.07 when applied to the ReflectGAN-generated signals, representing a 35\% increase in $R^2$, a 43\% reduction in RMSE, and a 43\% improvement in RPD compared to the best existing method (PMM-SU). The performance of the models with ReflectGAN is also better compared to their counterparts when applied to another dataset, i.e., Sentinel-2 imagery. These findings demonstrate the potential of ReflectGAN to improve SOC estimation accuracy in vegetated landscapes, supporting more reliable soil monitoring.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been used recently to align diffusion models with downstream objectives such as aesthetic quality and text-image consistency by fine-tuning them to maximize a single reward function under a fixed KL regularization. However, this approach is inherently restrictive in practice, where alignment must balance multiple, often conflicting objectives. Moreover, user preferences vary across prompts, individuals, and deployment contexts, with varying tolerances for deviation from a pre-trained base model. We address the problem of inference-time multi-preference alignment: given a set of basis reward functions and a reference KL regularization strength, can we design a fine-tuning procedure so that, at inference time, it can generate images aligned with any user-specified linear combination of rewards and regularization, without requiring additional fine-tuning? We propose Diffusion Blend, a novel approach to solve inference-time multi-preference alignment by blending backward diffusion processes associated with fine-tuned models, and we instantiate this approach with two algorithms: DB-MPA for multi-reward alignment and DB-KLA for KL regularization control. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion Blend algorithms consistently outperform relevant baselines and closely match or exceed the performance of individually fine-tuned models, enabling efficient, user-driven alignment at inference-time.

Abstract: Deep networks are prone to catastrophic forgetting during sequential task learning, i.e., losing the knowledge about old tasks upon learning new tasks. To this end, continual learning(CL) has emerged, whose existing methods focus mostly on regulating or protecting the parameters associated with the previous tasks. However, parameter protection is often impractical, since the size of parameters for storing the old-task knowledge increases linearly with the number of tasks, otherwise it is hard to preserve the parameters related to the old-task knowledge. In this work, we bring a dual opinion from neuroscience and physics to CL: in the whole networks, the pathways matter more than the parameters when concerning the knowledge acquired from the old tasks. Following this opinion, we propose a novel CL framework, learning without isolation(LwI), where model fusion is formulated as graph matching and the pathways occupied by the old tasks are protected without being isolated. Thanks to the sparsity of activation channels in a deep network, LwI can adaptively allocate available pathways for a new task, realizing pathway protection and addressing catastrophic forgetting in a parameter-efficient manner. Experiments on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LwI.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in document understanding. However, the information-dense nature of document images still poses challenges, as most queries depend on only a few relevant regions, with the rest being redundant. Existing one-pass MLLMs process entire document images without considering query relevance, often failing to focus on critical regions and producing unfaithful responses. Inspired by the human coarse-to-fine reading pattern, we introduce Doc-CoB (Chain-of-Box), a simple-yet-effective mechanism that integrates human-style visual reasoning into MLLM without modifying its architecture. Our method allows the model to autonomously select the set of regions (boxes) most relevant to the query, and then focus attention on them for further understanding. We first design a fully automatic pipeline, integrating a commercial MLLM with a layout analyzer, to generate 249k training samples with intermediate visual reasoning supervision. Then we incorporate two enabling tasks that improve box identification and box-query reasoning, which together enhance document understanding. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks with four popular models show that Doc-CoB significantly improves performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and wide applicability. All code, data, and models will be released publicly.

Abstract: This paper proposes a tropical geometry-based edge detection framework that reformulates convolution and gradient computations using min-plus and max-plus algebra. The tropical formulation emphasizes dominant intensity variations, contributing to sharper and more continuous edge representations. Three variants are explored: an adaptive threshold-based method, a multi-kernel min-plus method, and a max-plus method emphasizing structural continuity. The framework integrates multi-scale processing, Hessian filtering, and wavelet shrinkage to enhance edge transitions while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments on MATLAB built-in grayscale and color images suggest that tropical formulations integrated with classical operators, such as Canny and LoG, can improve boundary detection in low-contrast and textured regions. Quantitative evaluation using standard edge metrics indicates favorable edge clarity and structural coherence. These results highlight the potential of tropical algebra as a scalable and noise-aware formulation for edge detection in practical image analysis tasks.

Abstract: We present a memory-efficient algorithm for significantly enhancing the quality of segmented 3D micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) images of rocks using a generative model. The proposed model achieves a 16x increase in resolution and corrects inaccuracies in segmentation caused by the overlapping X-ray attenuation in micro-CT measurements across different minerals. The generative model employed is a 3D Octree-based convolutional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty. To address the challenge of high memory consumption inherent in standard 3D convolutional layers, we implemented an Octree structure within the 3D progressive growing generator model. This enabled the use of memory-efficient 3D Octree-based convolutional layers. The approach is pivotal in overcoming the long-standing memory bottleneck in volumetric deep learning, making it possible to reach 16x super-resolution in 3D, a scale that is challenging to attain due to cubic memory scaling. For training, we utilized segmented 3D low-resolution micro-CT images along with unpaired segmented complementary 2D high-resolution laser scanning microscope images. Post-training, resolution improved from 7 to 0.44 micro-m/voxel with accurate segmentation of constituent minerals. Validated on Berea sandstone, this framework demonstrates substantial improvements in pore characterization and mineral differentiation, offering a robust solution to one of the primary computational limitations in modern geoscientific imaging.

Abstract: Learning on triangle meshes has recently proven to be instrumental to a myriad of tasks, from shape classification, to segmentation, to deformation and animation, to mention just a few. While some of these applications are tackled through neural network architectures which are tailored to the application at hand, many others use generic frameworks for triangle meshes where the only customization required is the modification of the input features and the loss function. Our goal in this paper is to broaden the applicability of these generic frameworks to "wild", i.e. meshes in-the-wild which often have multiple components, non-manifold elements, disrupted connectivity, or a combination of these. We propose a configurable meta-framework based on the concept of caged geometry: Given a mesh, a cage is a single component manifold triangle mesh that envelopes it closely. Generalized barycentric coordinates map between functions on the cage, and functions on the mesh, allowing us to learn and test on a variety of data, in different applications. We demonstrate this concept by learning segmentation and skinning weights on difficult data, achieving better performance to state of the art techniques on wild meshes.

<title>How to build a consistency model: Learning flow maps via self-distillation</title>

Abstract: Building on the framework proposed in Boffi et al. (2024), we present a systematic approach for learning flow maps associated with flow and diffusion models. Flow map-based models, commonly known as consistency models, encompass recent efforts to improve the efficiency of generative models based on solutions to differential equations. By exploiting a relationship between the velocity field underlying a continuous-time flow and the instantaneous rate of change of the flow map, we show how to convert existing distillation schemes into direct training algorithms via self-distillation, eliminating the need for pre-trained models. We empirically evaluate several instantiations of our framework, finding that high-dimensional tasks like image synthesis benefit from objective functions that avoid temporal and spatial derivatives of the flow map, while lower-dimensional tasks can benefit from objectives incorporating higher-order derivatives to capture sharp features.

<title>Don't Look Only Once: Towards Multimodal Interactive Reasoning with Selective Visual Revisitation</title>

Abstract: We present v1, a lightweight extension to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that enables selective visual revisitation during inference. While current MLLMs typically consume visual input only once and reason purely over internal memory, v1 introduces a simple point-and-copy mechanism that allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant image regions throughout the reasoning process. This mechanism augments existing architectures with minimal modifications, enabling contextual access to visual tokens based on the model's evolving hypotheses. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Experiments on three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks -- MathVista, MathVision, and MathVerse -- demonstrate that v1 consistently improves performance over comparable baselines, particularly on tasks requiring fine-grained visual reference and multi-step reasoning. Our results suggest that dynamic visual access is a promising direction for enhancing grounded multimodal reasoning. Code, models, and data will be released to support future research.

Abstract: Visual encoders have become fundamental components in modern computer vision pipelines. However, ensuring robustness against adversarial perturbations remains a critical challenge. Recent efforts have explored both supervised and unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning strategies. We identify two key limitations in these approaches: (i) they often suffer from instability, especially during the early stages of fine-tuning, resulting in suboptimal convergence and degraded performance on clean data, and (ii) they exhibit a suboptimal trade-off between robustness and clean data accuracy, hindering the simultaneous optimization of both objectives. To overcome these challenges, we propose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning framework. LORE utilizes constrained optimization, which offers a principled approach to balancing competing goals, such as improving robustness while preserving nominal performance. By enforcing embedding-space proximity constraints, LORE effectively maintains clean data performance throughout adversarial fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that LORE significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness with minimal degradation in clean data accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the adversarially fine-tuned CLIP image encoder in out-of-distribution generalization and enhancing the interpretability of image embeddings.

Abstract: Cell boundary information is crucial for analyzing cell behaviors from time-lapse microscopy videos. Existing supervised cell segmentation tools, such as ImageJ, require tuning various parameters and rely on restrictive assumptions about the shape of the objects. While recent supervised segmentation tools based on convolutional neural networks enhance accuracy, they depend on high-quality labelled images, making them unsuitable for segmenting new types of objects not in the database. We developed a novel unsupervised cell segmentation algorithm based on fast Gaussian processes for noisy microscopy images without the need for parameter tuning or restrictive assumptions about the shape of the object. We derived robust thresholding criteria adaptive for heterogeneous images containing distinct brightness at different parts to separate objects from the background, and employed watershed segmentation to distinguish touching cell objects. Both simulated studies and real-data analysis of large microscopy images demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our approach compared with the alternatives.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong zero-shot performance across diverse downstream text-image tasks. Existing CLIP methods typically optimize a contrastive objective using negative samples drawn from each minibatch. To achieve robust representation learning, these methods require extremely large batch sizes and escalate computational demands to hundreds or even thousands of GPUs. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue often compromise downstream performance, prolong training duration, or face scalability challenges with very large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose AmorLIP, an efficient CLIP pretraining framework that amortizes expensive computations involved in contrastive learning through lightweight neural networks, which substantially improves training efficiency and performance. Leveraging insights from a spectral factorization of energy-based models, we introduce novel amortization objectives along with practical techniques to improve training stability. Extensive experiments across 38 downstream tasks demonstrate the superior zero-shot classification and retrieval capabilities of AmorLIP, consistently outperforming standard CLIP baselines with substantial relative improvements of up to 12.24%.

Abstract: While diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with their ability to synthesize realistic and diverse scenes, they continue to struggle to generate consistent and legible text within images. This shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal generative modeling. We release our entire evaluation pipeline at https://github.com/tianyu-z/STRICT-Bench.

<title>VerIPO: Cultivating Long Reasoning in Video-LLMs via Verifier-Gudied Iterative Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) shows significant promise for complex video reasoning. However, popular Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) methods, such as outcome-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are limited by data preparation bottlenecks (e.g., noise or high cost) and exhibit unstable improvements in the quality of long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) and downstream performance.To address these limitations, we propose VerIPO, a Verifier-guided Iterative Policy Optimization method designed to gradually improve video LLMs' capacity for generating deep, long-term reasoning chains. The core component is Rollout-Aware Verifier, positioned between the GRPO and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training phases to form the GRPO-Verifier-DPO training loop. This verifier leverages small LLMs as a judge to assess the reasoning logic of rollouts, enabling the construction of high-quality contrastive data, including reflective and contextually consistent CoTs. These curated preference samples drive the efficient DPO stage (7x faster than GRPO), leading to marked improvements in reasoning chain quality, especially in terms of length and contextual consistency. This training loop benefits from GRPO's expansive search and DPO's targeted optimization. Experimental results demonstrate: 1) Significantly faster and more effective optimization compared to standard GRPO variants, yielding superior performance; 2) Our trained models exceed the direct inference of large-scale instruction-tuned Video-LLMs, producing long and contextually consistent CoTs on diverse video reasoning tasks; and 3) Our model with one iteration outperforms powerful LMMs (e.g., Kimi-VL) and long reasoning models (e.g., Video-R1), highlighting its effectiveness and stability.

Abstract: The field of robotics has made significant strides toward developing generalist robot manipulation policies. However, evaluating these policies in real-world scenarios remains time-consuming and challenging, particularly as the number of tasks scales and environmental conditions change. In this work, we demonstrate that world models can serve as a scalable, reproducible, and reliable proxy for real-world robot policy evaluation. A key challenge is generating accurate policy videos from world models that faithfully reflect the robot actions. We observe that directly inputting robot actions or using high-dimensional encoding methods often fails to generate action-following videos. To address this, we propose Policy2Vec, a simple yet effective approach to turn a video generation model into a world simulator that follows latent action to generate the robot video. We then introduce WorldEval, an automated pipeline designed to evaluate real-world robot policies entirely online. WorldEval effectively ranks various robot policies and individual checkpoints within a single policy, and functions as a safety detector to prevent dangerous actions by newly developed robot models. Through comprehensive paired evaluations of manipulation policies in real-world environments, we demonstrate a strong correlation between policy performance in WorldEval and real-world scenarios. Furthermore, our method significantly outperforms popular methods such as real-to-sim approach.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have greatly enhanced their capability to jointly process text and images. However, despite extensive benchmarks evaluating visual comprehension (e.g., diagrams, color schemes, OCR tasks...), there is limited assessment of VLMs' ability to read and reason about text-rich images effectively. To fill this gap, we introduce ReadBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reading comprehension capabilities of VLMs. ReadBench transposes contexts from established text-only benchmarks into images of text while keeping textual prompts and questions intact. Evaluating leading VLMs with ReadBench, we find minimal-but-present performance degradation on short, text-image inputs, while performance sharply declines for longer, multi-page contexts. Our experiments further reveal that text resolution has negligible effects on multimodal performance. These findings highlight needed improvements in VLMs, particularly their reasoning over visually presented extensive textual content, a capability critical for practical applications. ReadBench is available at https://github.com/answerdotai/ReadBench .

<title>ASPO: Adaptive Sentence-Level Preference Optimization for Fine-Grained Multimodal Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained significant attention for its simplicity and computational efficiency in aligning large language models (LLMs). Recent advancements have extended DPO to multimodal scenarios, achieving strong performance. However, traditional DPO relies on binary preference optimization, rewarding or penalizing entire responses without considering fine-grained segment correctness, leading to suboptimal solutions. The root of this issue lies in the absence of fine-grained supervision during the optimization process. To address this, we propose Adaptive Sentence-level Preference Optimization (ASPO), which evaluates individual sentences for more precise preference optimization. By dynamically calculating adaptive rewards at the sentence level based on model predictions, ASPO enhances response content assessment without additional models or parameters. This significantly improves the alignment of multimodal features. Extensive experiments show that ASPO substantially enhances the overall performance of multimodal models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position token compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current challenges in token compression research and outline promising future directions. Ultimately, our work aims to offer a fresh perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing research, and catalyze innovative developments to address the challenges that increasing context lengths pose to the AI community's advancement.

Abstract: Leveraging the diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, models like Sora, CogVideoX and Wan have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video, image-to-video, and video editing tasks. Despite these advances, diffusion-based video generation remains computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution, long-duration videos. Prior work accelerates its inference by skipping computation, usually at the cost of severe quality degradation. In this paper, we propose SRDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages collaboration between large and small models to reduce inference cost. The large model handles high-noise steps to ensure semantic and motion fidelity (Sketching), while the smaller model refines visual details in low-noise steps (Rendering). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, over 3$\times$ speedup for Wan with nearly no quality loss for VBench, and 2$\times$ speedup for CogVideoX. Our method is introduced as a new direction orthogonal to existing acceleration strategies, offering a practical solution for scalable video generation.

Abstract: Modality fusion is a cornerstone of multimodal learning, enabling information integration from diverse data sources. However, vanilla fusion methods are limited by (1) inability to account for heterogeneous interactions between modalities and (2) lack of interpretability in uncovering the multimodal interactions inherent in the data. To this end, we propose I2MoE (Interpretable Multimodal Interaction-aware Mixture of Experts), an end-to-end MoE framework designed to enhance modality fusion by explicitly modeling diverse multimodal interactions, as well as providing interpretation on a local and global level. First, I2MoE utilizes different interaction experts with weakly supervised interaction losses to learn multimodal interactions in a data-driven way. Second, I2MoE deploys a reweighting model that assigns importance scores for the output of each interaction expert, which offers sample-level and dataset-level interpretation. Extensive evaluation of medical and general multimodal datasets shows that I2MoE is flexible enough to be combined with different fusion techniques, consistently improves task performance, and provides interpretation across various real-world scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/Raina-Xin/I2MoE.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events recurrence risk in acute myocardial infarction patients based on postoperative cardiac MRI and associated clinical notes is crucial for precision treatment and personalized intervention. Existing methods primarily focus on risk stratification capability while overlooking the need for intermediate robust reasoning and model interpretability in clinical practice. Moreover, end-to-end risk prediction using LLM/VLM faces significant challenges due to data limitations and modeling complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose CardioCoT, a novel two-stage hierarchical reasoning-enhanced survival analysis framework designed to enhance both model interpretability and predictive performance. In the first stage, we employ an evidence-augmented self-refinement mechanism to guide LLM/VLMs in generating robust hierarchical reasoning trajectories based on associated radiological findings. In the second stage, we integrate the reasoning trajectories with imaging data for risk model training and prediction. CardioCoT demonstrates superior performance in MACE recurrence risk prediction while providing interpretable reasoning processes, offering valuable insights for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Advanced autoregressive models have reshaped multimodal AI. However, their transformative potential in medical imaging remains largely untapped due to the absence of a unified visual tokenizer -- one capable of capturing fine-grained visual structures for faithful image reconstruction and realistic image synthesis, as well as rich semantics for accurate diagnosis and image interpretation. To this end, we present MedITok, the first unified tokenizer tailored for medical images, encoding both low-level structural details and high-level clinical semantics within a unified latent space. To balance these competing objectives, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework: a visual representation alignment stage that cold-starts the tokenizer reconstruction learning with a visual semantic constraint, followed by a textual semantic representation alignment stage that infuses detailed clinical semantics into the latent space. Trained on the meticulously collected large-scale dataset with over 30 million medical images and 2 million image-caption pairs, MedITok achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 30 datasets across 9 imaging modalities and 4 different tasks. By providing a unified token space for autoregressive modeling, MedITok supports a wide range of tasks in clinical diagnostics and generative healthcare applications. Model and code will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/Masaaki-75/meditok.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel across diverse tasks but suffer from high inference costs in time and memory. Token sparsity mitigates inefficiencies in token usage, while neuron sparsity reduces high-dimensional computations, both offering promising solutions to enhance efficiency. Recently, these two sparsity paradigms have evolved largely in parallel, fostering the prevailing assumption that they function independently. However, a fundamental yet underexplored question remains: Do they truly operate in isolation, or is there a deeper underlying interplay that has yet to be uncovered? In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation into this question. By introducing and analyzing the matching mechanism between Core Neurons and Core Tokens, we found that key neurons and tokens for inference mutually influence and reinforce each other. Building on this insight, we propose CoreMatching, a co-adaptive sparse inference framework, which leverages the synergy between token and neuron sparsity to enhance inference efficiency. Through theoretical analysis and efficiency evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on ten image understanding tasks and three hardware devices. Notably, on the NVIDIA Titan Xp, it achieved 5x FLOPs reduction and a 10x overall speedup. Code is released at https://github.com/wangqinsi1/2025-ICML-CoreMatching/tree/main.

Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning dataset tailored for the classification of bent radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) in astronomical observations. Bent radio AGN, distinguished by their curved jet structures, provide critical insights into galaxy cluster dynamics, interactions within the intracluster medium, and the broader physics of AGN. Despite their astrophysical significance, the classification of bent radio AGN remains a challenge due to the scarcity of specialized datasets and benchmarks. To address this, we present a dataset, derived from a well-recognized radio astronomy survey, that is designed to support the classification of NAT (Narrow-Angle Tail) and WAT (Wide-Angle Tail) categories, along with detailed data processing steps. We further evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models on the dataset, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer-based architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced machine learning models in classifying bent radio AGN, with ConvNeXT achieving the highest F1-scores for both NAT and WAT sources. By sharing this dataset and benchmarks, we aim to facilitate the advancement of research in AGN classification, galaxy cluster environments and galaxy evolution.

Abstract: Autonomous robots typically need to construct representations of their surroundings and adapt their motions to the geometry of their environment. Here, we tackle the problem of constructing a policy model for collision-free motion generation, consistent with the environment, from a single input RGB image. Extracting 3D structures from a single image often involves monocular depth estimation. Developments in depth estimation have given rise to large pre-trained models such as DepthAnything. However, using outputs of these models for downstream motion generation is challenging due to frustum-shaped errors that arise. Instead, we propose a framework known as Video-Generation Environment Representation (VGER), which leverages the advances of large-scale video generation models to generate a moving camera video conditioned on the input image. Frames of this video, which form a multiview dataset, are then input into a pre-trained 3D foundation model to produce a dense point cloud. We then introduce a multi-scale noise approach to train an implicit representation of the environment structure and build a motion generation model that complies with the geometry of the representation. We extensively evaluate VGER over a diverse set of indoor and outdoor environments. We demonstrate its ability to produce smooth motions that account for the captured geometry of a scene, all from a single RGB input image.

Abstract: Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) methods focus on tasks that demand reasoning with information extending beyond the explicit content depicted in the image. Early methods relied on explicit knowledge bases to provide this auxiliary information. Recent approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as implicit knowledge sources. While KB-VQA methods have demonstrated promising results, their potential remains constrained as the auxiliary text provided may not be relevant to the question context, and may also include irrelevant information that could misguide the answer predictor. We introduce a novel four-stage framework called Grounding Caption-Guided Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (GC-KBVQA), which enables LLMs to effectively perform zero-shot VQA tasks without the need for end-to-end multimodal training. Innovations include grounding question-aware caption generation to move beyond generic descriptions and have compact, yet detailed and context-rich information. This is combined with knowledge from external sources to create highly informative prompts for the LLM. GC-KBVQA can address a variety of VQA tasks, and does not require task-specific fine-tuning, thus reducing both costs and deployment complexity by leveraging general-purpose, pre-trained LLMs. Comparison with competing KB-VQA methods shows significantly improved performance.

Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6% in F1-score and 16.6% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect reasoners in challenging, novel scenarios.

Abstract: Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its fully differentiable design integrating modular tasks, i.e. perception, prediction and planing, which enables optimization in pursuit of the ultimate goal. Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view) computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA. We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0 PDMS.

<title>Exploring the Possibility of TypiClust for Low-Budget Federated Active Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) seeks to reduce the burden of annotation under the realistic constraints of federated learning by leveraging Active Learning (AL). As FAL settings make it more expensive to obtain ground truth labels, FAL strategies that work well in low-budget regimes, where the amount of annotation is very limited, are needed. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of TypiClust, a successful low-budget AL strategy, in low-budget FAL settings. Our empirical results show that TypiClust works well even in low-budget FAL settings contrasted with relatively low performances of other methods, although these settings present additional challenges, such as data heterogeneity, compared to AL. In addition, we show that FAL settings cause distribution shifts in terms of typicality, but TypiClust is not very vulnerable to the shifts. We also analyze the sensitivity of TypiClust to feature extraction methods, and it suggests a way to perform FAL even in limited data situations.

<title>A Contrastive Learning Foundation Model Based on Perfectly Aligned Sample Pairs for Remote Sensing Images</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19447</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL) methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically, PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks to augmented images rather than random cropping. With disjoint masks, we divide patches from different views into different parts that are semantically aligned but inconsistent in appearance. Our framework provides high-quality features by ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its sparse inputs. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, which verified the superiority of our method. We hope this work will contribute to practical remote sensing interpretation works.

<title>Diversity-Driven Generative Dataset Distillation Based on Diffusion Model with Self-Adaptive Memory</title>

Abstract: Dataset distillation enables the training of deep neural networks with comparable performance in significantly reduced time by compressing large datasets into small and representative ones. Although the introduction of generative models has made great achievements in this field, the distributions of their distilled datasets are not diverse enough to represent the original ones, leading to a decrease in downstream validation accuracy. In this paper, we present a diversity-driven generative dataset distillation method based on a diffusion model to solve this problem. We introduce self-adaptive memory to align the distribution between distilled and real datasets, assessing the representativeness. The degree of alignment leads the diffusion model to generate more diverse datasets during the distillation process. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in most situations, proving its ability to tackle dataset distillation tasks.

<title>WQLCP: Weighted Adaptive Conformal Prediction for Robust Uncertainty Quantification Under Distribution Shifts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19587</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a framework for constructing prediction sets with guaranteed coverage, assuming exchangeable data. However, real-world scenarios often involve distribution shifts that violate exchangeability, leading to unreliable coverage and inflated prediction sets. To address this challenge, we first introduce Reconstruction Loss-Scaled Conformal Prediction (RLSCP), which utilizes reconstruction losses derived from a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as an uncertainty metric to scale score functions. While RLSCP demonstrates performance improvements, mainly resulting in better coverage, it quantifies quantiles based on a fixed calibration dataset without considering the discrepancies between test and train datasets in an unexchangeable setting. In the next step, we propose Weighted Quantile Loss-scaled Conformal Prediction (WQLCP), which refines RLSCP by incorporating a weighted notion of exchangeability, adjusting the calibration quantile threshold based on weights with respect to the ratio of calibration and test loss values. This approach improves the CP-generated prediction set outputs in the presence of distribution shifts. Experiments on large-scale datasets, including ImageNet variants, demonstrate that WQLCP outperforms existing baselines by consistently maintaining coverage while reducing prediction set sizes, providing a robust solution for CP under distribution shifts.

<title>Multiplicity is an Inevitable and Inherent Challenge in Multimodal Learning</title>

Abstract: Multimodal learning has seen remarkable progress, particularly with the emergence of large-scale pre-training across various modalities. However, most current approaches are built on the assumption of a deterministic, one-to-one alignment between modalities. This oversimplifies real-world multimodal relationships, where their nature is inherently many-to-many. This phenomenon, named multiplicity, is not a side-effect of noise or annotation error, but an inevitable outcome of semantic abstraction, representational asymmetry, and task-dependent ambiguity in multimodal tasks. This position paper argues that multiplicity is a fundamental bottleneck that manifests across all stages of the multimodal learning pipeline: from data construction to training and evaluation. This paper examines the causes and consequences of multiplicity, and highlights how multiplicity introduces training uncertainty, unreliable evaluation, and low dataset quality. This position calls for new research directions on multimodal learning: novel multiplicity-aware learning frameworks and dataset construction protocols considering multiplicity.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing task-relevant from irrelevant signals, particularly in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem: the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks such as image classification or pure text question answering, where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem. We further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to fine-tune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations via Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and a consistency regularization strategy applied to model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy, and VQA tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes FieldWorkArena, a benchmark for agentic AI targeting real-world field work. With the recent increase in demand for agentic AI, they are required to monitor and report safety and health incidents, as well as manufacturing-related incidents, that may occur in real-world work environments. Existing agentic AI benchmarks have been limited to evaluating web tasks and are insufficient for evaluating agents in real-world work environments, where complexity increases significantly. In this paper, we define a new action space that agentic AI should possess for real world work environment benchmarks and improve the evaluation function from previous methods to assess the performance of agentic AI in diverse real-world tasks. The dataset consists of videos captured on-site and documents actually used in factories and warehouses, and tasks were created based on interviews with on-site workers and managers. Evaluation results confirmed that performance evaluation considering the characteristics of Multimodal LLM (MLLM) such as GPT-4o is feasible. Additionally, the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed new evaluation method were identified. The complete dataset (HuggingFace) and evaluation program (GitHub) can be downloaded from the following website: https://en-documents.research.global.fujitsu.com/fieldworkarena/.

<title>Grounding Language with Vision: A Conditional Mutual Information Calibrated Decoding Strategy for Reducing Hallucinations in LVLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, where generated responses seem semantically plausible yet exhibit little or no relevance to the input image. Previous studies reveal that this issue primarily stems from LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors while disregarding the visual information during decoding. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a novel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding strategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated texts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods solely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the contributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination mitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual information. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that dynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining maximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image tokens most pertinent to the generated response. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks reveal that the proposed method significantly reduces hallucinations in LVLMs while preserving decoding efficiency.

Abstract: Using massive datasets, foundation models are large-scale, pre-trained models that perform a wide range of tasks. These models have shown consistently improved results with the introduction of new methods. It is crucial to analyze how these trends impact the medical field and determine whether these advancements can drive meaningful change. This study investigates the application of recent state-of-the-art foundation models, DINOv2, MAE, VMamba, CoCa, SAM2, and AIMv2, for medical image classification. We explore their effectiveness on datasets including CBIS-DDSM for mammography, ISIC2019 for skin lesions, APTOS2019 for diabetic retinopathy, and CHEXPERT for chest radiographs. By fine-tuning these models and evaluating their configurations, we aim to understand the potential of these advancements in medical image classification. The results indicate that these advanced models significantly enhance classification outcomes, demonstrating robust performance despite limited labeled data. Based on our results, AIMv2, DINOv2, and SAM2 models outperformed others, demonstrating that progress in natural domain training has positively impacted the medical domain and improved classification outcomes.

Abstract: Understanding pain-related facial behaviors is essential for digital healthcare in terms of effective monitoring, assisted diagnostics, and treatment planning, particularly for patients unable to communicate verbally. Existing data-driven methods of detecting pain from facial expressions are limited due to interpretability and severity quantification. To this end, we propose GraphAU-Pain, leveraging a graph-based framework to model facial Action Units (AUs) and their interrelationships for pain intensity estimation. AUs are represented as graph nodes, with co-occurrence relationships as edges, enabling a more expressive depiction of pain-related facial behaviors. By utilizing a relational graph neural network, our framework offers improved interpretability and significant performance gains. Experiments conducted on the publicly available UNBC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the GraphAU-Pain, achieving an F1-score of 66.21% and accuracy of 87.61% in pain intensity estimation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and (ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery.

<title>ICDM: Interference Cancellation Diffusion Models for Wireless Semantic Communications</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved significant success in wireless communications systems due to their denoising capabilities. The broadcast nature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise, but also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can effectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems. In this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and interference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent estimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an interference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint posterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference, along with the channel transition probablity. The log-gradients of these distributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately estimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with advanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference cancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces the mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes without ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $20$ dB and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB and improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning models deployed on edge devices, e.g., for quality control in Additive Manufacturing (AM), are frequently small in size. Such models usually have to deliver highly accurate results within a short time frame. Methods that are commonly employed in literature start out with larger trained models and try to reduce their memory and latency footprint by structural pruning, knowledge distillation, or quantization. It is, however, also possible to leverage hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an approach that seeks to systematically explore the architecture space to find optimized configurations. In this study, a hardware-aware NAS workflow is introduced that couples an edge device located in Belgium with a powerful High-Performance Computing system in Germany, to train possible architecture candidates as fast as possible while performing real-time latency measurements on the target hardware. The approach is verified on a use case in the AM domain, based on the open RAISE-LPBF dataset, achieving ~8.8 times faster inference speed while simultaneously enhancing model quality by a factor of ~1.35, compared to a human-designed baseline.

Abstract: Generating high-quality piano audio from video requires precise synchronization between visual cues and musical output, ensuring accurate semantic and temporal alignment.However, existing evaluation datasets do not fully capture the intricate synchronization required for piano music generation. A comprehensive benchmark is essential for two primary reasons: (1) existing metrics fail to reflect the complexity of video-to-piano music interactions, and (2) a dedicated benchmark dataset can provide valuable insights to accelerate progress in high-quality piano music generation. To address these challenges, we introduce the CoP Benchmark Dataset-a fully open-sourced, multimodal benchmark designed specifically for video-guided piano music generation. The proposed Chain-of-Perform (CoP) benchmark offers several compelling features: (1) detailed multimodal annotations, enabling precise semantic and temporal alignment between video content and piano audio via step-by-step Chain-of-Perform guidance; (2) a versatile evaluation framework for rigorous assessment of both general-purpose and specialized video-to-piano generation tasks; and (3) full open-sourcing of the dataset, annotations, and evaluation protocols. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/acappemin/Video-to-Audio-and-Piano, with a continuously updated leaderboard to promote ongoing research in this domain.

Abstract: Text-to-multiview (T2MV) generation, which produces coherent multiview images from a single text prompt, remains computationally intensive, while accelerated T2MV methods using few-step diffusion models often sacrifice image fidelity and view consistency. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to jointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we first reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov decision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a joint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV sampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both viewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the cost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base sampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that uses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning signals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward objective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view metrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view fidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more efficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained optimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning framework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step T2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its few-step efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, capable of producing high-quality samples that generalize beyond the training data. However, evaluating this generalization remains challenging: theoretical metrics are often impractical for high-dimensional data, while no practical metrics rigorously measure generalization. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing probability flow distance ($\texttt{PFD}$), a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient metric to measure distributional generalization. Specifically, $\texttt{PFD}$ quantifies the distance between distributions by comparing their noise-to-data mappings induced by the probability flow ODE. Moreover, by using $\texttt{PFD}$ under a teacher-student evaluation protocol, we empirically uncover several key generalization behaviors in diffusion models, including: (1) scaling behavior from memorization to generalization, (2) early learning and double descent training dynamics, and (3) bias-variance decomposition. Beyond these insights, our work lays a foundation for future empirical and theoretical studies on generalization in diffusion models.

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning holds immense potential for collaboratively training models from multiple sources without sharing raw data, addressing both data scarcity and privacy concerns, two key challenges in healthcare. A major challenge in training multimodal federated models in healthcare is the presence of missing modalities due to multiple reasons, including variations in clinical practice, cost and accessibility constraints, retrospective data collection, privacy concerns, and occasional technical or human errors. Previous methods typically rely on publicly available real datasets or synthetic data to compensate for missing modalities. However, obtaining real datasets for every disease is impractical, and training generative models to synthesize missing modalities is computationally expensive and prone to errors due to the high dimensionality of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight, low-dimensional feature translator to reconstruct bottleneck features of the missing modalities. Our experiments on three different datasets (MIMIC-CXR, NIH Open-I, and CheXpert), in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings consistently improve the performance of competitive baselines.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the angle testing problem in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces and propose two projection-based probabilistic kernel functions, one designed for angle comparison and the other for angle thresholding. Unlike existing approaches that rely on random projection vectors drawn from Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages reference angles and employs a deterministic structure for the projection vectors. Notably, our kernel functions do not require asymptotic assumptions, such as the number of projection vectors tending to infinity, and can be both theoretically and experimentally shown to outperform Gaussian-distribution-based kernel functions. We further apply the proposed kernel function to Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) and demonstrate that our approach achieves a 2.5X ~ 3X higher query-per-second (QPS) throughput compared to the state-of-the-art graph-based search algorithm HNSW.

<title>OmniCharacter: Towards Immersive Role-Playing Agents with Seamless Speech-Language Personality Interaction</title>

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), benefiting from large language models, is an emerging interactive AI system that simulates roles or characters with diverse personalities. However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/OmniCharacter.

Abstract: Manga, or Japanese comics, is a richly multimodal narrative form that blends images and text in complex ways. Teaching large multimodal models (LMMs) to understand such narratives at a human-like level could help manga creators reflect on and refine their stories. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks for multimodal manga understanding: MangaOCR, which targets in-page text recognition, and MangaVQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding through visual question answering. MangaVQA consists of 526 high-quality, manually constructed question-answer pairs, enabling reliable evaluation across diverse narrative and visual scenarios. Building on these benchmarks, we develop MangaLMM, a manga-specialized model finetuned from the open-source LMM Qwen2.5-VL to jointly handle both tasks. Through extensive experiments, including comparisons with proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5, we assess how well LMMs understand manga. Our benchmark and model provide a comprehensive foundation for evaluating and advancing LMMs in the richly narrative domain of manga.

Abstract: We propose ArtSAGENet, a novel multimodal architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to jointly learn visual and semantic-based artistic representations. First, we illustrate the significant advantages of multi-task learning for fine art analysis and argue that it is conceptually a much more appropriate setting in the fine art domain than the single-task alternatives. We further demonstrate that several GNN architectures can outperform strong CNN baselines in a range of fine art analysis tasks, such as style classification, artist attribution, creation period estimation, and tag prediction, while training them requires an order of magnitude less computational time and only a small amount of labeled data. Finally, through extensive experimentation we show that our proposed ArtSAGENet captures and encodes valuable relational dependencies between the artists and the artworks, surpassing the performance of traditional methods that rely solely on the analysis of visual content. Our findings underline a great potential of integrating visual content and semantics for fine art analysis and curation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multimodal emotion recognition system, VIsual Spoken Textual Additive Net (VISTANet), to classify emotions reflected by input containing image, speech, and text into discrete classes. A new interpretability technique, K-Average Additive exPlanation (KAAP), has been developed that identifies important visual, spoken, and textual features leading to predicting a particular emotion class. The VISTANet fuses information from image, speech, and text modalities using a hybrid of intermediate and late fusion. It automatically adjusts the weights of their intermediate outputs while computing the weighted average. The KAAP technique computes the contribution of each modality and corresponding features toward predicting a particular emotion class. To mitigate the insufficiency of multimodal emotion datasets labelled with discrete emotion classes, we have constructed the IIT-R MMEmoRec dataset consisting of images, corresponding speech and text, and emotion labels ('angry,' 'happy,' 'hate,' and 'sad'). The VISTANet has resulted in an overall emotion recognition accuracy of 80.11% on the IIT-R MMEmoRec dataset using visual, spoken, and textual modalities, outperforming single or dual-modality configurations. The code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/MIntelligence-Group/MMEmoRec.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of Object State Classification (OSC) as a zero-shot learning problem. Specifically, we propose the first Object-agnostic State Classification (OaSC) method that infers the state of a certain object without relying on the knowledge or the estimation of the object class. In that direction, we capitalize on Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for structuring and organizing knowledge, which, in combination with visual information, enable the inference of the states of objects in object/state pairs that have not been encountered in the method's training set. A series of experiments investigate the performance of the proposed method in various settings, against several hypotheses and in comparison with state of the art approaches for object attribute classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge of an object class is not decisive for the prediction of its state. Moreover, the proposed OaSC method outperforms existing methods in all datasets and benchmarks by a great margin.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have achieved impressive performance in many vision tasks. While the token mixer or attention block has been studied in great detail, much less research has been devoted to the channel mixer or feature mixing block (FFN or MLP), which accounts for a significant portion of the model parameters and computation. In this work, we show that the dense MLP connections can be replaced with a sparse block diagonal MLP structure that supports larger expansion ratios by splitting MLP features into groups. To improve the feature clusters formed by this structure we propose the use of a lightweight, parameter-free, channel covariance attention (CCA) mechanism as a parallel branch during training. This enables gradual feature mixing across channel groups during training whose contribution decays to zero as the training progresses to convergence. As a result, the CCA block can be discarded during inference, enabling enhanced performance at no additional computational cost. The resulting $\textit{Scalable CHannEl MixEr}$ (SCHEME) can be plugged into any ViT architecture to obtain a gamut of models with different trade-offs between complexity and performance by controlling the block diagonal MLP structure. This is shown by the introduction of a new family of SCHEMEformer models. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, with $\textbf{12 different ViT backbones}$, consistently demonstrate substantial accuracy/latency gains (upto $\textbf{1.5\% /20\%})$ over existing designs, especially for lower complexity regimes. The SCHEMEformer family is shown to establish new Pareto frontiers for accuracy vs FLOPS, accuracy vs model size, and accuracy vs throughput, especially for fast transformers of small size.

Abstract: Planar scene representations have recently witnessed increased interests for modeling scenes from images, as their lightweight planar structure enables compatibility with image-based models. Notably, K-Planes have gained particular attention as they extend planar scene representations to support in-the-wild scenes, in addition to object-level scenes. However, their visual quality has recently lagged behind that of state-of-the-art techniques. To reduce this gap, we propose RefinedFields, a method that leverages pre-trained networks to refine K-Planes scene representations via optimization guidance using an alternating training procedure. We carry out extensive experiments and verify the merit of our method on synthetic data and real tourism photo collections. RefinedFields enhances rendered scenes with richer details and improves upon its base representation on the task of novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Researchers have proposed to use data of human preference feedback to fine-tune text-to-image generative models. However, the scalability of human feedback collection has been limited by its reliance on manual annotation. Therefore, we develop and test a method to automatically score user preferences from their spontaneous facial expression reaction to the generated images. We collect a dataset of Facial Expression Reaction to Generated Images (FERGI) and show that the activations of multiple facial action units (AUs) are highly correlated with user evaluations of the generated images. We develop an FAU-Net (Facial Action Units Neural Network), which receives inputs from an AU estimation model, to automatically score user preferences for text-to-image generation based on their facial expression reactions, which is complementary to the pre-trained scoring models based on the input text prompts and generated images. Integrating our FAU-Net valence score with the pre-trained scoring models improves their consistency with human preferences. This method of automatic annotation with facial expression analysis can be potentially generalized to other generation tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ShuangquanFeng/FERGI, and the dataset is also available at the same link for research purposes.

Abstract: Efficiently finding optimal correspondences between point clouds is crucial for solving both rigid and non-rigid point cloud registration problems. Existing methods often rely on geometric or semantic feature embedding to establish correspondences and estimate transformations or flow fields. Recently, state-of-the-art methods have employed RAFT-like iterative updates to refine the solution. However, these methods have certain limitations. Firstly, their iterative refinement design lacks transparency, and their iterative updates follow a fixed path during the refinement process, which can lead to suboptimal results. Secondly, these methods overlook the importance of refining or optimizing correspondences (or matching matrices) as a precursor to solving transformations or flow fields. They typically compute candidate correspondences based on distances in the point feature space. However, they only project the candidate matching matrix into some matrix space once with Sinkhorn or dual softmax operations to obtain final correspondences. This one-shot projected matching matrix may be far from the globally optimal one, and these approaches do not consider the distribution of the target matching matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that exploits the Denoising Diffusion Model to predict a searching gradient for the optimal matching matrix within the Doubly Stochastic Matrix Space. During the reverse denoising process, our method iteratively searches for better solutions along this denoising gradient, which points towards the maximum likelihood direction of the target matching matrix. Our method offers flexibility by allowing the search to start from any initial matching matrix provided by the online backbone or white noise. Experimental evaluations on the 3DMatch/3DLoMatch and 4DMatch/4DLoMatch datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly designed framework.

Abstract: Precision medicine, such as patient-adaptive treatments assisted by medical image analysis, poses new challenges for segmentation algorithms in adapting to new patients, due to the large variability across different patients and the limited availability of annotated data for each patient. In this work, we propose a data-efficient segmentation algorithm, namely Part-aware Prompted Segment Anything Model ($P^2SAM$). Without any model fine-tuning, $P^2SAM$ enables seamless adaptation to any new patients relying only on one-shot patient-specific data. We introduce a novel part-aware prompt mechanism to select multiple-point prompts based on the part-level features of the one-shot data, which can be extensively integrated into different promptable segmentation models, such as SAM and SAM 2. Moreover, to determine the optimal number of parts for each specific case, we propose a distribution-guided retrieval approach that further enhances the robustness of the part-aware prompt mechanism. $P^2SAM$ improves the performance by +8.0% and +2.0% mean Dice score for two different patient-adaptive segmentation applications, respectively. In addition, $P^2SAM$ also exhibits impressive generalizability in other adaptive segmentation tasks in the natural image domain, e.g., +6.4% mIoU within personalized object segmentation task.

Abstract: Enhancing semantic grounding abilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often involves collecting domain-specific training data, refining the network architectures, or modifying the training recipes. In this work, we venture into an orthogonal direction and explore whether VLMs can improve their semantic grounding by "receiving" feedback, without requiring in-domain data, fine-tuning, or modifications to the network architectures. We systematically analyze this hypothesis using a feedback mechanism composed of a binary signal. We find that if prompted appropriately, VLMs can utilize feedback both in a single step and iteratively, showcasing the potential of feedback as an alternative technique to improve grounding in internet-scale VLMs. Furthermore, VLMs, like LLMs, struggle to self-correct errors out-of-the-box. However, we find that this issue can be mitigated via a binary verification mechanism. Finally, we explore the potential and limitations of amalgamating these findings and applying them iteratively to automatically enhance VLMs' grounding performance, showing grounding accuracy consistently improves using automated feedback across all models in all settings investigated. Overall, our iterative framework improves semantic grounding in VLMs by more than 15 accuracy points under noise-free feedback and up to 5 accuracy points under a simple automated binary verification mechanism.

Abstract: Hyperspectral target detection (HTD) aims to identify specific materials based on spectral information in hyperspectral imagery and can detect extremely small-sized objects, some of which occupy a smaller than one-pixel area. However, existing HTD methods are developed based on per-pixel binary classification, neglecting the three-dimensional cube structure of hyperspectral images (HSIs) that integrates both spatial and spectral dimensions. The synergistic existence of spatial and spectral features in HSIs enable objects to simultaneously exhibit both, yet the per-pixel HTD framework limits the joint expression of these features. In this paper, we rethink HTD from the perspective of spatial-spectral synergistic representation and propose hyperspectral point object detection as an innovative task framework. We introduce SpecDETR, the first specialized network for hyperspectral multi-class point object detection, which eliminates dependence on pre-trained backbone networks commonly required by vision-based object detectors. SpecDETR uses a multi-layer Transformer encoder with self-excited subpixel-scale attention modules to directly extract deep spatial-spectral joint features from hyperspectral cubes. We develop a simulated hyperspectral point object detection benchmark termed SPOD, and for the first time, evaluate and compare the performance of visual object detection networks and HTD methods on hyperspectral point object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SpecDETR outperforms SOTA visual object detection networks and HTD methods. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuLi123/SpecDETR.

Abstract: As Visual Language Models (VLMs) become increasingly embedded in everyday applications, ensuring they can recognize and appropriately handle privacy-sensitive content is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art VLMs and identify limitations in their understanding of visual privacy. Existing datasets suffer from label inconsistencies, limiting their reliability. To address this, we introduce two compact, high-quality benchmarks, PrivBench and PrivBench-H, that focus on commonly recognized privacy categories aligned with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Additionally, we present PrivTune, an instruction-tuning dataset specifically curated to improve privacy sensitivity. We obtain a Privacy VLM by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf VLM on only 100 samples from PrivTune, which leads to substantial gains on all benchmarks, surpassing GPT-4, while maintaining strong performance on other tasks. Our findings show that privacy-awareness in VLMs can be substantially improved with minimal data and careful dataset design, setting the stage for safer, more privacy-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Real-time and high-performance 3D object detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving and robotics. Recent pillar-based 3D object detectors have gained significant attention due to their compact representation and low computational overhead, making them suitable for onboard deployment and quantization. However, existing pillar-based detectors still suffer from information loss along height dimension and large numerical distribution difference during pillar feature encoding (PFE), which severely limits their performance and quantization potential. To address above issue, we first unveil the importance of different input information during PFE and identify the height dimension as a key factor in enhancing 3D detection performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a height-aware pillar feature encoder, called PillarHist. Specifically, PillarHist statistics the discrete distribution of points at different heights within one pillar with the information entropy guidance. This simple yet effective design greatly preserves the information along the height dimension while significantly reducing the computation overhead of the PFE. Meanwhile, PillarHist also constrains the arithmetic distribution of PFE input to a stable range, making it quantization-friendly. Notably, PillarHist operates exclusively within the PFE stage to enhance performance, enabling seamless integration into existing pillar-based methods without introducing complex operations. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PillarHist in terms of both efficiency and performance.

Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, marks a significant step toward artificial general intelligence. Existing methods typically align vision encoders with LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but this often deteriorates their ability to handle multiple languages as training progresses. We empirically observe that imbalanced SFT datasets, largely English-centric, degrade performance on non-English languages due to the failure in multilingual token alignment. To address this, we propose PARROT, a novel approach that leverages textual guidance for visual token alignment at the language level. PARROT conditions visual tokens on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to align multilingual tokens. By computing cross-attention between initial visual features and textual embeddings, we select the most relevant experts, converting visual tokens into language-specific representations. Additionally, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark (MMMB), a new benchmark comprising 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, to assess multilingual capabilities. PARROT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the multilingual benchmarks and a wide range of multimodal tasks. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Parrot

Abstract: Adversarial purification is a kind of defense technique that can defend against various unseen adversarial attacks without modifying the victim classifier. Existing methods often depend on external generative models or cooperation between auxiliary functions and victim classifiers. However, retraining generative models, auxiliary functions, or victim classifiers relies on the domain of the fine-tuned dataset and is computation-consuming. In this work, we suppose that adversarial images are outliers of the natural image manifold, and the purification process can be considered as returning them to this manifold. Following this assumption, we present a simple adversarial purification method without further training to purify adversarial images, called ZeroPur. ZeroPur contains two steps: given an adversarial example, Guided Shift obtains the shifted embedding of the adversarial example by the guidance of its blurred counterparts; after that, Adaptive Projection constructs a directional vector by this shifted embedding to provide momentum, projecting adversarial images onto the manifold adaptively. ZeroPur is independent of external models and requires no retraining of victim classifiers or auxiliary functions, relying solely on victim classifiers themselves to achieve purification. Extensive experiments on three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K) using various classifier architectures (ResNet, WideResNet) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art robust performance. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Dense video captioning involves detecting and describing events within video sequences. Traditional methods operate in an offline setting, assuming the entire video is available for analysis. In contrast, in this work we introduce a groundbreaking paradigm: Live Video Captioning (LVC), where captions must be generated for video streams in an online manner. This shift brings unique challenges, including processing partial observations of the events and the need for a temporal anticipation of the actions. We formally define the novel problem of LVC and propose innovative evaluation metrics specifically designed for this online scenario, demonstrating their advantages over traditional metrics. To address the novel complexities of LVC, we present a new model that combines deformable transformers with temporal filtering, enabling effective captioning over video streams. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions dataset validate the proposed approach, showcasing its superior performance in the LVC setting compared to state-of-the-art offline methods. To foster further research, we provide the results of our model and an evaluation toolkit with the new metrics integrated at: https://github.com/gramuah/lvc.

Abstract: In computer vision, Image Difference Captioning (IDC) is crucial for accurately describing variations between closely related images. Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the model's robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, Image-Editing-Request, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 97% CIDEr points in average.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating content creation and modification. For example, variations of a given content, be it text or images, can be created almost instantly and at a low cost. This will soon lead to the majority of text and images being created directly by AI models or by humans assisted by AI. This poses new risks; for example, AI-generated content may be used to train newer AI models and degrade their performance, or information may be lost in the transformations made by AI which could occur when the same content is processed over and over again by AI tools. An example of AI image modifications is inpainting in which an AI model completes missing fragments of an image. The incorporation of inpainting tools into photo editing programs promotes their adoption and encourages their recursive use to modify images. Inpainting can be applied recursively, starting from an image, removing some parts, applying inpainting to reconstruct the image, revising it, and then starting the inpainting process again on the reconstructed image, etc. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of recursive inpainting when using one of the most widely used image models: Stable Diffusion. The inpainting process is applied by randomly selecting a fragment of the image, reconstructing it, selecting another fragment, and repeating the process a predefined number of iterations. The images used in the experiments are taken from a publicly available art data set and correspond to different styles and historical periods. Additionally, photographs are also evaluated as a reference. The modified images are compared with the original ones by both using quantitative metrics and performing a qualitative analysis. The results show that recursive inpainting in some cases modifies the image so that it still resembles the original one while in others leads to degeneration.

Abstract: Reconstruction-based anomaly detection via denoising diffusion model has limitations in determining appropriate noise parameters that can degrade anomalies while preserving normal characteristics. Also, normal regions can fluctuate considerably during reconstruction, resulting in false detection. In this paper, we propose a method to detect anomalies by analysis of reconstruction trend depending on the degree of degradation, effectively solving the both problems that impede practical application in display inspection.

Abstract: Recently, the degenerate preconditioned proximal point (PPP) method provides a unified and flexible framework for designing and analyzing operator-splitting algorithms such as Douglas-Rachford (DR). However, the degenerate PPP method exhibits weak convergence in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and lacks accelerated variants. To address these issues, we propose a Halpern-type PPP (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence and acceleration properties of Halpern's iteration method. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm for image restoration by combining HPPP with denoiser priors such as Plug-and-Play (PnP) prior, which can be viewed as an accelerated PnP method. Finally, numerical experiments including several toy examples and image restoration validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

<title>Reenact Anything: Semantic Video Motion Transfer Using Motion-Textual Inversion</title>

Abstract: Recent years have seen a tremendous improvement in the quality of video generation and editing approaches. While several techniques focus on editing appearance, few address motion. Current approaches using text, trajectories, or bounding boxes are limited to simple motions, so we specify motions with a single motion reference video instead. We further propose to use a pre-trained image-to-video model rather than a text-to-video model. This approach allows us to preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and helps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual inversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract appearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding injected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent motion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated motion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per frame, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the motion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images to generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not require spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image, generalizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the semantic video motion transfer task, significantly outperforming existing methods in this context.

<title>Compositional Physical Reasoning of Objects and Events from Videos</title>

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about objects' physical properties in the natural world is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. While some properties like colors and shapes can be directly observed, others, such as mass and electric charge, are hidden from the objects' visual appearance. This paper addresses the unique challenge of inferring these hidden physical properties from objects' motion and interactions and predicting corresponding dynamics based on the inferred physical properties. We first introduce the Compositional Physical Reasoning (ComPhy) dataset. For a given set of objects, ComPhy includes limited videos of them moving and interacting under different initial conditions. The model is evaluated based on its capability to unravel the compositional hidden properties, such as mass and charge, and use this knowledge to answer a set of questions. Besides the synthetic videos from simulators, we also collect a real-world dataset to show further test physical reasoning abilities of different models. We evaluate state-of-the-art video reasoning models on ComPhy and reveal their limited ability to capture these hidden properties, which leads to inferior performance. We also propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework, Physical Concept Reasoner (PCR), that learns and reasons about both visible and hidden physical properties from question answering. After training, PCR demonstrates remarkable capabilities. It can detect and associate objects across frames, ground visible and hidden physical properties, make future and counterfactual predictions, and utilize these extracted representations to answer challenging questions.

<title>V-RoAst: Visual Road Assessment. Can VLM be a Road Safety Assessor Using the iRAP Standard?</title>

Abstract: Road traffic crashes result in millions of deaths annually and significant economic burdens, particularly on Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Road safety assessments traditionally rely on human-labelled data, which is labour-intensive and time-consuming. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced automated road safety assessments, they typically demand large labelled datasets and often require fine-tuning for each new geographic context. This study explores whether Vision Language Models (VLMs) with zero-shot capability can overcome these limitations to serve as effective road safety assessors using the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) standard. Our approach, V-RoAst (Visual question answering for Road Assessment), leverages advanced VLMs, such as Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini, to analyse road safety attributes without requiring any labelled training data. By optimising prompt engineering and utilising crowdsourced imagery from Mapillary, V-RoAst provides a scalable, cost-effective, and automated solution for global road safety assessments. Preliminary results show that while VLMs achieve lower performance than CNN-based models, they are capable of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and show potential in predicting star ratings from crowdsourced imagery. However, their performance is poor when key visual features are absent in the imagery, emphasising the need for human labelling to address these gaps. Advancements in VLMs, alongside in-context learning such as chain-of-thought and few-shot learning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, present opportunities for improvement, making VLMs promising tools for road assessment tasks. Designed for resource-constrained stakeholders, this framework holds the potential to save lives and reduce economic burdens worldwide.

Abstract: Simple data augmentation techniques, such as rotations and flips, are widely used to enhance the generalization power of computer vision models. However, these techniques often fail to modify high-level semantic attributes of a class. To address this limitation, researchers have explored generative augmentation methods like the recently proposed DA-Fusion. Despite some progress, the variations are still largely limited to textural changes, thus falling short on aspects like varied viewpoints, environment, weather conditions, or even class-level semantic attributes (eg, variations in a dog's breed). To overcome this challenge, we propose DIAGen, building upon DA-Fusion. First, we apply Gaussian noise to the embeddings of an object learned with Textual Inversion to diversify generations using a pre-trained diffusion model's knowledge. Second, we exploit the general knowledge of a text-to-text generative model to guide the image generation of the diffusion model with varied class-specific prompts. Finally, we introduce a weighting mechanism to mitigate the impact of poorly generated samples. Experimental results across various datasets show that DIAGen not only enhances semantic diversity but also improves the performance of subsequent classifiers. The advantages of DIAGen over standard augmentations and the DA-Fusion baseline are particularly pronounced with out-of-distribution samples.

Abstract: Abundant, well-annotated multimodal data in remote sensing are pivotal for aligning complex visual remote sensing (RS) scenes with human language, enabling the development of specialized vision language models across diverse RS interpretation tasks. However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications. The RSTeller dataset is available at https://github.com/SlytherinGe/RSTeller.

Abstract: In extreme scenarios such as nighttime or low-visibility environments, achieving reliable perception is critical for applications like autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance. Multi-modality image fusion, particularly integrating infrared imaging, offers a robust solution by combining complementary information from different modalities to enhance scene understanding and decision-making. However, current methods face significant limitations: GAN-based approaches often produce blurry images that lack fine-grained details, while AE-based methods may introduce bias toward specific modalities, leading to unnatural fusion results. To address these challenges, we propose DAE-Fuse, a novel two-phase discriminative autoencoder framework that generates sharp and natural fused images. Furthermore, We pioneer the extension of image fusion techniques from static images to the video domain while preserving temporal consistency across frames, thus advancing the perceptual capabilities required for autonomous navigation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DAE-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, with superior generalizability to tasks like medical image fusion.

Abstract: Object detection from aerial platforms under adverse atmospheric conditions, particularly haze, is paramount for robust drone autonomy. Yet, this domain remains largely underexplored, primarily hindered by the absence of specialized benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{HazyDet}, the first, large-scale benchmark specifically designed for drone-view object detection in hazy conditions. Comprising 383,000 real-world instances derived from both naturally hazy captures and synthetically hazed scenes augmented from clear images, HazyDet provides a challenging and realistic testbed for advancing detection algorithms. To address the severe visual degradation induced by haze, we propose the Depth-Conditioned Detector (DeCoDet), a novel architecture that integrates a Depth-Conditioned Kernel to dynamically modulate feature representations based on depth cues. The practical efficacy and robustness of DeCoDet are further enhanced by its training with a Progressive Domain Fine-Tuning (PDFT) strategy to navigate synthetic-to-real domain shifts, and a Scale-Invariant Refurbishment Loss (SIRLoss) to ensure resilient learning from potentially noisy depth annotations. Comprehensive empirical validation on HazyDet substantiates the superiority of our unified DeCoDet framework, which achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the closest competitor by a notable +1.5\% mAP on challenging real-world hazy test scenarios. Our dataset and toolkit are available at https://github.com/GrokCV/HazyDet.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle when deployed in real-world settings due to distribution shifts between training and test data. While existing approaches like domain adaptation and test-time training (TTT) offer partial solutions, they typically require additional data or domain-specific auxiliary tasks. We present Idempotent Test-Time Training (IT$^3$), a novel approach that enables on-the-fly adaptation to distribution shifts using only the current test instance, without any auxiliary task design. Our key insight is that enforcing idempotence -- where repeated applications of a function yield the same result -- can effectively replace domain-specific auxiliary tasks used in previous TTT methods. We theoretically connect idempotence to prediction confidence and demonstrate that minimizing the distance between successive applications of our model during inference leads to improved out-of-distribution performance. Extensive experiments across diverse domains (including image classification, aerodynamics prediction, and aerial segmentation) and architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) show that IT$^3$ consistently outperforms existing approaches while being simpler and more widely applicable. Our results suggest that idempotence provides a universal principle for test-time adaptation that generalizes across domains and architectures.

<title>Cross-Modal Bidirectional Interaction Model for Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Given a natural language expression and a remote sensing image, the goal of referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) is to generate a pixel-level mask of the target object identified by the referring expression. In contrast to natural scenarios, expressions in RRSIS often involve complex geospatial relationships, with target objects of interest that vary significantly in scale and lack visual saliency, thereby increasing the difficulty of achieving precise segmentation. To address the aforementioned challenges, a novel RRSIS framework is proposed, termed the cross-modal bidirectional interaction model (CroBIM). Specifically, a context-aware prompt modulation (CAPM) module is designed to integrate spatial positional relationships and task-specific knowledge into the linguistic features, thereby enhancing the ability to capture the target object. Additionally, a language-guided feature aggregation (LGFA) module is introduced to integrate linguistic information into multi-scale visual features, incorporating an attention deficit compensation mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, a mutual-interaction decoder (MID) is designed to enhance cross-modal feature alignment through cascaded bidirectional cross-attention, thereby enabling precise segmentation mask prediction. To further forster the research of RRSIS, we also construct RISBench, a new large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 52,472 image-language-label triplets. Extensive benchmarking on RISBench and two other prevalent datasets demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed CroBIM over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The source code for CroBIM and the RISBench dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/CroBIM

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across multimodal tasks such as visual perception and reasoning, leading to good performance on various multimodal evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks keep a static nature and overlap with the pre-training data, resulting in fixed complexity constraints and data contamination issues. This raises the concern regarding the validity of the evaluation. To address these two challenges, we introduce a dynamic multimodal evaluation protocol called Vision-Language Bootstrapping (VLB). VLB provides a robust and comprehensive assessment for LVLMs with reduced data contamination and flexible complexity. To this end, VLB dynamically generates new visual question-answering samples through a multimodal bootstrapping module that modifies both images and language, while ensuring that newly generated samples remain consistent with the original ones by a judge module. By composing various bootstrapping strategies, VLB offers dynamic variants of existing benchmarks with diverse complexities, enabling the evaluation to co-evolve with the ever-evolving capabilities of LVLMs. Extensive experimental results across multiple benchmarks, including SEEDBench, MMBench, and MME, show that VLB significantly reduces data contamination and exposes performance limitations of LVLMs.

Abstract: Millions of abandoned oil and gas wells are scattered across the world, leaching methane into the atmosphere and toxic compounds into the groundwater. Many of these locations are unknown, preventing the wells from being plugged and their polluting effects averted. Remote sensing is a relatively unexplored tool for pinpointing abandoned wells at scale. We introduce the first large-scale benchmark dataset for this problem, leveraging medium-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery from Planet Labs. Our curated dataset comprises over 213,000 wells (abandoned, suspended, and active) from Alberta, a region with especially high well density, sourced from the Alberta Energy Regulator and verified by domain experts. We evaluate baseline algorithms for well detection and segmentation, showing the promise of computer vision approaches but also significant room for improvement.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), as a versatile representation paradigm, have achieved success in various computer vision tasks. Due to the spectral bias of the vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), existing methods focus on designing MLPs with sophisticated architectures or repurposing training techniques for highly accurate INRs. In this paper, we delve into the linear dynamics model of MLPs and theoretically identify the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK) matrix as a reliable link between spectral bias and training dynamics. Based on this insight, we propose a practical Inductive Gradient Adjustment (IGA) method, which could purposefully improve the spectral bias via inductive generalization of eNTK-based gradient transformation matrix. Theoretical and empirical analyses validate impacts of IGA on spectral bias. Further, we evaluate our method on different INRs tasks with various INR architectures and compare to existing training techniques. The superior and consistent improvements clearly validate the advantage of our IGA. Armed with our gradient adjustment method, better INRs with more enhanced texture details and sharpened edges can be learned from data by tailored impacts on spectral bias.

Abstract: Ultra High Resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery (RSI) (e.g. 100,000 $\times$ 100,000 pixels or more) poses a significant challenge for current Remote Sensing Multimodal Large Language Models (RSMLLMs). If choose to resize the UHR image to standard input image size, the extensive spatial and contextual information that UHR images contain will be neglected. Otherwise, the original size of these images often exceeds the token limits of standard RSMLLMs, making it difficult to process the entire image and capture long-range dependencies to answer the query based on the abundant visual context. In this paper, we introduce ImageRAG for RS, a training-free framework to address the complexities of analyzing UHR remote sensing imagery. By transforming UHR remote sensing image analysis task to image's long context selection task, we design an innovative image contextual retrieval mechanism based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, denoted as ImageRAG. ImageRAG's core innovation lies in its ability to selectively retrieve and focus on the most relevant portions of the UHR image as visual contexts that pertain to a given query. Fast path and slow path are proposed in this framework to handle this task efficiently and effectively. ImageRAG allows RSMLLMs to manage extensive context and spatial information from UHR RSI, ensuring the analysis is both accurate and efficient. Codebase will be released in https://github.com/om-ai-lab/ImageRAG

Abstract: The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimodal generative models has sparked critical discussions on their reliability, fairness and potential for misuse. While text-to-image models excel at producing high-fidelity, user-guided content, they often exhibit unpredictable behaviors and vulnerabilities that can be exploited to manipulate class or concept representations. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework to assess model reliability by analyzing responses to global and local perturbations in the embedding space, enabling the identification of inputs that trigger unreliable or biased behavior. Beyond social implications, fairness and diversity are fundamental to defining robust and trustworthy model behavior. Our approach offers deeper insights into these essential aspects by evaluating: (i) generative diversity, measuring the breadth of visual representations for learned concepts, and (ii) generative fairness, which examines the impact that removing concepts from input prompts has on control, under a low guidance setup. Beyond these evaluations, our method lays the groundwork for detecting unreliable, bias-injected models and tracing the provenance of embedded biases. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/JJ-Vice/T2I_Fairness_Diversity_Reliability.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) is highly instrumental in machine learning applications within a large variety of domains. We investigate the geometry of this embedding, which is still not well understood. We examine the raw unnormalized embedding and show that text and image reside on linearly separable ellipsoid shells, not centered at the origin. We explain the benefits of having this structure, allowing to better embed instances according to their uncertainty during contrastive training. Frequent concepts in the dataset yield more false negatives, inducing greater uncertainty. A new notion of conformity is introduced, which measures the average cosine similarity of an instance to any other instance within a representative data set. We show this measure can be accurately estimated by simply computing the cosine similarity to the modality mean vector. Furthermore, we find that CLIP's modality gap optimizes the matching of the conformity distributions of image and text.

Abstract: Recent advances in radiance field reconstruction, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have achieved high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering by representing scenes with compositions of Gaussian primitives. However, 3D Gaussians present several limitations for scene reconstruction. Accurately capturing hard edges is challenging without significantly increasing the number of Gaussians, creating a large memory footprint. Moreover, they struggle to represent flat surfaces, as they are diffused in space. Without hand-crafted regularizers, they tend to disperse irregularly around the actual surface. To circumvent these issues, we introduce a novel method, named 3D Convex Splatting (3DCS), which leverages 3D smooth convexes as primitives for modeling geometrically-meaningful radiance fields from multi-view images. Smooth convex shapes offer greater flexibility than Gaussians, allowing for a better representation of 3D scenes with hard edges and dense volumes using fewer primitives. Powered by our efficient CUDA-based rasterizer, 3DCS achieves superior performance over 3DGS on benchmarks such as Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending. Specifically, our method attains an improvement of up to 0.81 in PSNR and 0.026 in LPIPS compared to 3DGS while maintaining high rendering speeds and reducing the number of required primitives. Our results highlight the potential of 3D Convex Splatting to become the new standard for high-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Project page: convexsplatting.github.io.

<title>What Makes a Scene ? Scene Graph-based Evaluation and Feedback for Controllable Generation</title>

Abstract: While text-to-image generation has been extensively studied, generating images from scene graphs remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to challenges in accurately modeling spatial relationships and object interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce Scene-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the factual consistency in generating natural scenes. Scene-Bench comprises MegaSG, a large-scale dataset of one million images annotated with scene graphs, facilitating the training and fair comparison of models across diverse and complex scenes. Additionally, we propose SGScore, a novel evaluation metric that leverages chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) to assess both object presence and relationship accuracy, offering a more effective measure of factual consistency than traditional metrics like FID and CLIPScore. Building upon this evaluation framework, we develop a scene graph feedback pipeline that iteratively refines generated images by identifying and correcting discrepancies between the scene graph and the image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scene-Bench provides a more comprehensive and effective evaluation framework compared to existing benchmarks, particularly for complex scene generation. Furthermore, our feedback strategy significantly enhances the factual consistency of image generation models, advancing the field of controllable image generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are, by design, inherently capable of multi-task learning: through a unified next-token prediction paradigm, they can naturally address a wide variety of downstream tasks. Prior work in the motion domain has demonstrated some generality by adapting LLMs via a Motion Tokenizer coupled with an autoregressive Transformer to generate and understand human motion. However, this generality remains limited in scope and yields only modest performance gains. We introduce VersatileMotion, a unified multimodal motion LLM that combines a novel motion tokenizer, integrating VQ-VAE with flow matching, and an autoregressive transformer backbone to seamlessly support at least nine distinct motion-related tasks. VersatileMotion is the first method to handle single-agent and multi-agent motions in a single framework and enable cross-modal conversion between motion, text, music, and speech, achieving state-of-the-art performance on seven of these tasks. Each sequence in MotionHub may include one or more of the following annotations: natural-language captions, music or audio clips, speech transcripts, and multi-agent interaction data. To facilitate evaluation, we define and release benchmark splits covering nine core tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance, versatility, and potential of VersatileMotion as a foundational model for future understanding and generation of motion.

Abstract: Open-world perception aims to develop a model adaptable to novel domains and various sensor configurations and can understand uncommon objects and corner cases. However, current research lacks sufficiently comprehensive open-world 3D perception benchmarks and robust generalizable methodologies. This paper introduces OpenAD, the first real open-world autonomous driving benchmark for 3D object detection. OpenAD is built upon a corner case discovery and annotation pipeline that integrates with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The proposed pipeline annotates corner case objects in a unified format for five autonomous driving perception datasets with 2000 scenarios. In addition, we devise evaluation methodologies and evaluate various open-world and specialized 2D and 3D models. Moreover, we propose a vision-centric 3D open-world object detection baseline and further introduce an ensemble method by fusing general and specialized models to address the issue of lower precision in existing open-world methods for the OpenAD benchmark. We host an online challenge on EvalAI. Data, toolkit codes, and evaluation codes are available at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/OpenAD.

Abstract: We present LiDAR-EDIT, a novel paradigm for generating synthetic LiDAR data for autonomous driving. Our framework edits real-world LiDAR scans by introducing new object layouts while preserving the realism of the background environment. Compared to end-to-end frameworks that generate LiDAR point clouds from scratch, LiDAR-EDIT offers users full control over the object layout, including the number, type, and pose of objects, while keeping most of the original real-world background. Our method also provides object labels for the generated data. Compared to novel view synthesis techniques, our framework allows for the creation of counterfactual scenarios with object layouts significantly different from the original real-world scene. LiDAR-EDIT uses spherical voxelization to enforce correct LiDAR projective geometry in the generated point clouds by construction. During object removal and insertion, generative models are employed to fill the unseen background and object parts that were occluded in the original real LiDAR scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework produces realistic LiDAR scans with practical value for downstream tasks.

<title>EDTformer: An Efficient Decoder Transformer for Visual Place Recognition</title>

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) aims to determine the general geographical location of a query image by retrieving visually similar images from a large geo-tagged database. To obtain a global representation for each place image, most approaches typically focus on the aggregation of deep features extracted from a backbone through using current prominent architectures (e.g., CNNs, MLPs, pooling layer, and transformer encoder), giving little attention to the transformer decoder. However, we argue that its strong capability to capture contextual dependencies and generate accurate features holds considerable potential for the VPR task. To this end, we propose an Efficient Decoder Transformer (EDTformer) for feature aggregation, which consists of several stacked simplified decoder blocks followed by two linear layers to directly produce robust and discriminative global representations. Specifically, we do this by formulating deep features as the keys and values, as well as a set of learnable parameters as the queries. Our EDTformer can fully utilize the contextual information within deep features, then gradually decode and aggregate the effective features into the learnable queries to output the global representations. Moreover, to provide more powerful deep features for EDTformer and further facilitate the robustness, we use the foundation model DINOv2 as the backbone and propose a Low-rank Parallel Adaptation (LoPA) method to enhance its performance in VPR, which can refine the intermediate features of the backbone progressively in a memory- and parameter-efficient way. As a result, our method not only outperforms single-stage VPR methods on multiple benchmark datasets, but also outperforms two-stage VPR methods which add a re-ranking with considerable cost. Code will be available at https://github.com/Tong-Jin01/EDTformer.

<title>Adaptive Rank, Reduced Forgetting: Knowledge Retention in Continual Learning Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Rank-Selective LoRA</title>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to accumulate knowledge from sequential data and task streams. Leveraging their strong generalization and flexibility, pre-trained vision-language embedding models such as CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) have been widely adopted and validated in CL. In addition to learning new knowledge, we investigate whether the pre-trained knowledge in CLIP, can be retained or even enhanced, in CL, while incorporating new knowledge from a data stream. Existing CL methods primarily focus on continual downstream adaptation using components isolated from the pre-trained model (PTM), increasing inference complexity and limiting improvements to the PTM itself; some also retain knowledge by relying on additional reference data, resulting in high training costs. To address these limitations, we propose a universal and efficient CL approach for CLIP based on Dynamic Rank-Selective LoRA (CoDyRA), which directly improves the PTMs while preserving the existing knowledge from both pre-training and CL. By analyzing how LoRA rank and placement affect learning and forgetting in CL, we design CoDyRA that adaptively performs rank-minimized parameter updates in different modules, based on their importance to the current data. This ensures a balance between knowledge acquisition (plasticity) and forgetting mitigation (stability). Our method operates without explicit domain or distribution prediction and does not rely on reference data, enabling seamless task integration while maintaining pre-trained capabilities. Moreover, CoDyRA preserves the original model architecture and deployment pipeline, introducing no additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments show that our approach enhances representations for new downstream data while retaining pre-trained knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art results.

<title>Self-Guidance: Boosting Flow and Diffusion Generation on Their Own</title>

Abstract: Proper guidance strategies are essential to achieve high-quality generation results without retraining diffusion and flow-based text-to-image models. Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms. We also introduce a more efficient approximation of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid doubling sampling time. We conduct experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG with only one forward pass. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability of eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code along with this paper.

Abstract: Adapting visual programming or prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate executable code for visual tasks like visual question answering (VQA) for specialized tasks or domains remains challenging due to high annotation and inference costs. We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with at most 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments. Experimental results show that, with a relatively small amount of question/answer data, small language models can generate high-quality specialized visual programs with the added benefit of much faster inference

<title>LinGen: Towards High-Resolution Minute-Length Text-to-Video Generation with Linear Computational Complexity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2412.09856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-video generation enhances content creation but is highly computationally intensive: The computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) scales quadratically in the number of pixels. This makes minute-length video generation extremely expensive, limiting most existing models to generating videos of only 10-20 seconds length. We propose a Linear-complexity text-to-video Generation (LinGen) framework whose cost scales linearly in the number of pixels. For the first time, LinGen enables high-resolution minute-length video generation on a single GPU without compromising quality. It replaces the computationally-dominant and quadratic-complexity block, self-attention, with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, combining a bidirectional Mamba2 block with our token rearrangement method, Rotary Major Scan, and our review tokens developed for long video generation. The TE-branch is a novel TEmporal Swin Attention block that focuses on temporal correlations between adjacent tokens and medium-range tokens. The MATE block addresses the adjacency preservation issue of Mamba and improves the consistency of generated videos significantly. Experimental results show that LinGen outperforms DiT (with a 75.6% win rate) in video quality with up to 15$\times$ (11.5$\times$) FLOPs (latency) reduction. Furthermore, both automatic metrics and human evaluation demonstrate our LinGen-4B yields comparable video quality to state-of-the-art models (with a 50.5%, 52.1%, 49.1% win rate with respect to Gen-3, LumaLabs, and Kling, respectively). This paves the way to hour-length movie generation and real-time interactive video generation. We provide 68s video generation results and more examples in our project website: https://lineargen.github.io/.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have proven effective in generating high-quality videos but are hindered by high computational costs. Existing video DiT sampling acceleration methods often rely on costly fine-tuning or exhibit limited generalization capabilities. We propose Asymmetric Reduction and Restoration (AsymRnR), a training-free and model-agnostic method to accelerate video DiTs. It builds on the observation that redundancies of feature tokens in DiTs vary significantly across different model blocks, denoising steps, and feature types. Our AsymRnR asymmetrically reduces redundant tokens in the attention operation, achieving acceleration with negligible degradation in output quality and, in some cases, even improving it. We also tailored a reduction schedule to distribute the reduction across components adaptively. To further accelerate this process, we introduce a matching cache for more efficient reduction. Backed by theoretical foundations and extensive experimental validation, AsymRnR integrates into state-of-the-art video DiTs and offers substantial speedup.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) involves determining the localization of drone images by retrieving the most similar GPS-tagged satellite images. However, the imaging gaps between platforms are often significant and the variations in viewpoints are substantial, which limits the ability of existing methods to effectively associate cross-view features and extract consistent and invariant characteristics. Moreover, existing methods often overlook the problem of increased computational and storage requirements when improving model performance. To handle these limitations, we propose a lightweight enhanced alignment network, called the Multi-Level Embedding and Alignment Network (MEAN). The MEAN network uses a progressive multi-level enhancement strategy, global-to-local associations, and cross-domain alignment, enabling feature communication across levels. This allows MEAN to effectively connect features at different levels and learn robust cross-view consistent mappings and modality-invariant features. Moreover, MEAN adopts a shallow backbone network combined with a lightweight branch design, effectively reducing parameter count and computational complexity. Experimental results on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that MEAN reduces parameter count by 62.17% and computational complexity by 70.99% compared to state-of-the-art models, while maintaining competitive or even superior performance. Our code and models will be released on https://github.com/ISChenawei/MEAN.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have shown transformative potential in medical imaging, yet concerns about fairness persist due to performance disparities across demographic subgroups. Existing methods aim to address these biases by mitigating sensitive attributes in image data; however, these attributes often carry clinically relevant information, and their removal can compromise model performance-a highly undesirable outcome. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Re-fusion After Disentanglement (FairREAD), a novel, simple, and efficient framework that mitigates unfairness by re-integrating sensitive demographic attributes into fair image representations. FairREAD employs orthogonality constraints and adversarial training to disentangle demographic information while using a controlled re-fusion mechanism to preserve clinically relevant details. Additionally, subgroup-specific threshold adjustments ensure equitable performance across demographic groups. Comprehensive evaluations on a large-scale clinical X-ray dataset demonstrate that FairREAD significantly reduces unfairness metrics while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for fairness and performance in medical image classification.

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV) has yet to fully achieve the zero-shot task generalization observed in Natural Language Processing (NLP), despite following many of the milestones established in NLP, such as large transformer models, extensive pre-training, and the auto-regression paradigm, among others. In this paper, we explore the idea that CV adopts discrete and terminological task definitions (\eg, ``image segmentation''), which may be a key barrier to zero-shot task generalization. Our hypothesis is that without truly understanding previously-seen tasks--due to these terminological definitions--deep models struggle to generalize to novel tasks. To verify this, we introduce Explanatory Instructions, which provide an intuitive way to define CV task objectives through detailed linguistic transformations from input images to outputs. We create a large-scale dataset comprising 12 million ``image input $\to$ explanatory instruction $\to$ output'' triplets, and train an auto-regressive-based vision-language model (AR-based VLM) that takes both images and explanatory instructions as input. By learning to follow these instructions, the AR-based VLM achieves instruction-level zero-shot capabilities for previously-seen tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization for unseen CV tasks. Code and dataset will be openly available on our GitHub repository.

Abstract: The evolution of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) has increased the need for robust and generalizable algorithms for multi-object tracking. Traditional statistical model-based tracking methods rely on predefined motion models and assumptions about system noise distributions. Although computationally efficient, they often lack adaptability to varying traffic scenarios and require extensive manual design and parameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose a novel 3D multi-object tracking approach for vehicles, HybridTrack, which integrates a data-driven Kalman Filter (KF) within a tracking-by-detection paradigm. In particular, it learns the transition residual and Kalman gain directly from data, which eliminates the need for manual motion and stochastic parameter modeling. Validated on the real-world KITTI dataset, HybridTrack achieves 82.72% HOTA accuracy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate our method under different configurations, achieving the fastest processing speed of 112 FPS. Consequently, HybridTrack eliminates the dependency on scene-specific designs while improving performance and maintaining real-time efficiency. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/leandro-svg/HybridTrack.

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) is a fundamental component in many computer vision tasks, yet achieving both high quantitative accuracy and perceptual quality remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose the Symmetrization Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (SWBCE) loss function, a novel approach that addresses this issue by leveraging the inherent asymmetry in human edge perception, where edge decisions require stronger justification than non-edge ones. By balancing label-guided and prediction-guided learning, SWBCE maintains high edge recall while effectively suppressing false positives. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and baseline models, along with comparisons to prior loss functions, demonstrate that our method consistently improves both the quantitative metrics and perceptual quality of ED results. These findings underscore the effectiveness of SWBCE for high-quality edge prediction and its potential applicability to related vision tasks.

Abstract: With the growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent studies on point-supervised OOD have attracted significant interest. In this paper, we propose PointOBB-v3, a stronger single point-supervised OOD framework. Compared to existing methods, it generates pseudo rotated boxes without additional priors and incorporates support for the end-to-end paradigm. PointOBB-v3 functions by integrating three unique image views: the original view, a resized view, and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Based on the views, a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module are constructed. In the first module, a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss and a Scale-Sensitive Feature Fusion (SSFF) module are introduced to improve the model's ability to estimate object scale. To achieve precise angle predictions, the second module employs symmetry-based self-supervised learning. Additionally, we introduce an end-to-end version that eliminates the pseudo-label generation process by integrating a detector branch and introduces an Instance-Aware Weighting (IAW) strategy to focus on high-quality predictions. We conducted extensive experiments on the DIOR-R, DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0, FAIR1M, STAR, and RSAR datasets. Across all these datasets, our method achieves an average improvement in accuracy of 3.56% in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable performance recently, and thus model hubs have emerged. Existing model hubs typically assume basic text matching is sufficient to search for models. However, in reality, due to different abstractions and the large number of models in model hubs, it is not easy for users to review model descriptions and example images, choosing which model best meets their needs. Therefore, it is necessary to describe model functionality wisely so that future users can efficiently search for the most suitable model for their needs. Efforts to address this issue remain limited. In this paper, we propose Conditional Generative Model Identification (CGI), which aims to provide an effective way to identify the most suitable model using user-provided example images rather than requiring users to manually review a large number of models with example images. To address this problem, we propose the PromptBased Model Identification (PMI) , which can adequately describe model functionality and precisely match requirements with specifications. To evaluate PMI approach and promote related research, we provide a benchmark comprising 65 models and 9100 identification tasks. Extensive experimental and human evaluation results demonstrate that PMI is effective. For instance, 92% of models are correctly identified with significantly better FID scores when four example images are provided.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation due to its efficiency and high-fidelity rendering. 3DGS training requires a known camera pose for each input view, typically obtained by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Pioneering works have attempted to relax this restriction but still face difficulties when handling long sequences with complex camera trajectories. In this paper, we propose Rob-GS, a robust framework to progressively estimate camera poses and optimize 3DGS for arbitrarily long video inputs. In particular, by leveraging the inherent continuity of videos, we design an adjacent pose tracking method to ensure stable pose estimation between consecutive frames. To handle arbitrarily long inputs, we propose a Gaussian visibility retention check strategy to adaptively split the video sequence into several segments and optimize them separately. Extensive experiments on Tanks and Temples, ScanNet, and a self-captured dataset show that Rob-GS outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive number of patches in gigapixel images. While transformer architectures excel at modeling long-range correlations through self-attention, their quadratic computational complexity makes them impractical for computational pathology applications. Existing solutions like local-global or linear self-attention reduce computational costs but compromise the strong modeling capabilities of full self-attention. In this work, we propose Querent, i.e., the query-aware long contextual dynamic modeling framework, which achieves a theoretically bounded approximation of full self-attention while delivering practical efficiency. Our method adaptively predicts which surrounding regions are most relevant for each patch, enabling focused yet unrestricted attention computation only with potentially important contexts. By using efficient region-wise metadata computation and importance estimation, our approach dramatically reduces computational overhead while preserving global perception to model fine-grained patch correlations. Through comprehensive experiments on biomarker prediction, gene mutation prediction, cancer subtyping, and survival analysis across over 10 WSI datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

<title>STAF: Sinusoidal Trainable Activation Functions for Implicit Neural Representation</title>

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling continuous signals. The spectral bias of ReLU-based networks is a well-established limitation, restricting their ability to capture fine-grained details in target signals. While previous works have attempted to mitigate this issue through frequency-based encodings or architectural modifications, these approaches often introduce additional complexity and do not fully address the underlying challenge of learning high-frequency components efficiently. We introduce Sinusoidal Trainable Activation Functions (STAF), designed to directly tackle this limitation by enabling networks to adaptively learn and represent complex signals with higher precision and efficiency. STAF inherently modulates its frequency components, allowing for self-adaptive spectral learning. This capability significantly improves convergence speed and expressivity, making STAF highly effective for both signal representations and inverse problems. Through extensive evaluations across a range of tasks, including signal representation (shape, image, audio) and inverse problems (super-resolution, denoising), as well as neural radiance fields (NeRF), we demonstrate that STAF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and reconstruction fidelity. These results establish STAF as a robust solution to spectral bias and the capacity--convergence tradeoff, with broad applicability in computer vision and graphics. Our codebase is publicly accessible at https://github.com/AlirezaMorsali/STAF.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are crucial for scaling model capacity while controlling inference costs. While integrating MoE into multimodal models like CLIP improves performance, training these models is notoriously challenging and expensive. We propose CLIP-Upcycling (CLIP-UP), an efficient alternative training strategy that converts a pre-trained dense CLIP model into a sparse MoE architecture. Through extensive experimentation with various settings and auxiliary losses, we demonstrate that CLIP-UP significantly reduces training complexity and cost. Remarkably, our sparse CLIP B/16 model, trained with CLIP-UP, outperforms its dense counterpart by 7.2% and 6.6% on COCO and Flickr30k text-to-image Recall@1 benchmarks respectively. It even surpasses the larger CLIP L/14 model on this task while using only 30% of the inference FLOPs. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our training recipe across different scales, establishing sparse upcycling as a practical and scalable approach for building efficient, high-performance CLIP models.

<title>VideoJAM: Joint Appearance-Motion Representations for Enhanced Motion Generation in Video Models</title>

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent progress, generative video models still struggle to capture real-world motion, dynamics, and physics. We show that this limitation arises from the conventional pixel reconstruction objective, which biases models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoJAM, a novel framework that instills an effective motion prior to video generators, by encouraging the model to learn a joint appearance-motion representation. VideoJAM is composed of two complementary units. During training, we extend the objective to predict both the generated pixels and their corresponding motion from a single learned representation. During inference, we introduce Inner-Guidance, a mechanism that steers the generation toward coherent motion by leveraging the model's own evolving motion prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. Notably, our framework can be applied to any video model with minimal adaptations, requiring no modifications to the training data or scaling of the model. VideoJAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion coherence, surpassing highly competitive proprietary models while also enhancing the perceived visual quality of the generations. These findings emphasize that appearance and motion can be complementary and, when effectively integrated, enhance both the visual quality and the coherence of video generation.

Abstract: Decoding visual images from brain activity has significant potential for advancing brain-computer interaction and enhancing the understanding of human perception. Recent approaches align the representation spaces of images and brain activity to enable visual decoding. In this paper, we introduce the use of human-aligned image encoders to map brain signals to images. We hypothesize that these models more effectively capture perceptual attributes associated with the rapid visual stimuli presentations commonly used in visual brain data recording experiments. Our empirical results support this hypothesis, demonstrating that this simple modification improves image retrieval accuracy by up to 21% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive experiments confirm consistent performance improvements across diverse EEG architectures, image encoders, alignment methods, participants, and brain imaging modalities

Abstract: We introduce WorldSense, the first benchmark to assess the multi-modal video understanding, that simultaneously encompasses visual, audio, and text inputs. In contrast to existing benchmarks, our WorldSense has several features: (i) collaboration of omni-modality, we design the evaluation tasks to feature a strong coupling of audio and video, requiring models to effectively utilize the synergistic perception of omni-modality; (ii) diversity of videos and tasks, WorldSense encompasses a diverse collection of 1,662 audio-visual synchronised videos, systematically categorized into 8 primary domains and 67 fine-grained subcategories to cover the broad scenarios, and 3,172 multi-choice QA pairs across 26 distinct tasks to enable the comprehensive evaluation; (iii) high-quality annotations, all the QA pairs are manually labeled by 80 expert annotators with multiple rounds of correction to ensure quality. Based on our WorldSense, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results indicate that existing models face significant challenges in understanding real-world scenarios (48.0% best accuracy). By analyzing the limitations of current models, we aim to provide valuable insight to guide development of real-world understanding. We hope our WorldSense can provide a platform for evaluating the ability in constructing and understanding coherent contexts from omni-modality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in time series forecasting have explored augmenting models with text or vision modalities to improve accuracy. While text provides contextual understanding, it often lacks fine-grained temporal details. Conversely, vision captures intricate temporal patterns but lacks semantic context, limiting the complementary potential of these modalities. To address this, we propose \method, a novel multimodal framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and textual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal features through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner, which encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented Learner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components collaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings, which are then fused with temporal features for final prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-VLM achieves superior performance, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, thereby establishing a new direction for multimodal time series forecasting.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention power state-of-the-art video generation, but suffer from prohibitive compute cost -- when generating just a 5-second 720P video, attention alone takes 800 out of 945 seconds of total inference time. This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being hardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the first efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving 58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over FlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading video DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s without quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further lowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench. We make our codebase public at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo.

Abstract: Purpose: Earth system models (ESMs) integrate the interactions of the atmosphere, ocean, land, ice, and biosphere to estimate the state of regional and global climate under a wide variety of conditions. The ESMs are highly complex; thus, deep neural network architectures are used to model the complexity and store the down-sampled data. This paper proposes the Vision Transformer Sinusoidal Representation Networks (ViSIR) to improve the ESM data's single image SR (SR) reconstruction task.
  Methods: ViSIR combines the SR capability of Vision Transformers (ViT) with the high-frequency detail preservation of the Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) to address the spectral bias observed in SR tasks.
  Results: The ViSIR outperforms SRCNN by 2.16 db, ViT by 6.29 dB, SIREN by 8.34 dB, and SR-Generative Adversarial (SRGANs) by 7.93 dB PSNR on average for three different measurements.
  Conclusion: The proposed ViSIR is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed algorithm is outperforming other methods in terms of Mean Square Error(MSE), Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio(PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure(SSIM).

Abstract: Detecting AI generated images is a challenging yet essential task. A primary difficulty arises from the detectors tendency to rely on spurious patterns, such as compression artifacts, which can influence its decisions. These issues often stem from specific patterns that the detector associates with the real data distribution, making it difficult to isolate the actual generative traces. We argue that an image should be classified as fake if and only if it contains artifacts introduced by the generative model. Based on this premise, we propose Stay Positive, an algorithm designed to constrain the detectors focus to generative artifacts while disregarding those associated with real data. Experimental results demonstrate that detectors trained with Stay Positive exhibit reduced susceptibility to spurious correlations, leading to improved generalization and robustness to post processing. Additionally, unlike detectors that associate artifacts with real images, those that focus purely on fake artifacts are better at detecting inpainted real images.

<title>Without Paired Labeled Data: End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning for Drone-view Geo-Localization</title>

Abstract: Drone-view Geo-Localization (DVGL) aims to achieve accurate localization of drones by retrieving the most relevant GPS-tagged satellite images. However, most existing methods heavily rely on strictly pre-paired drone-satellite images for supervised learning. When the target region shifts, new paired samples are typically required to adapt to the distribution changes. The high cost of annotation and the limited transferability of these methods significantly hinder the practical deployment of DVGL in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end self-supervised learning method with a shallow backbone network. It employs a clustering algorithm to generate pseudo-labels and adopts a dual-path contrastive learning framework to learn discriminative intra-view representations. Furthermore, our method incorporates two core modules, including the dynamic hierarchical memory learning module (DHML) and the information consistency evolution learning module (ICEL). The DHML combines short-term and long-term memory to enhance intra-view feature consistency and discriminability. Meanwhile, the ICEL module utilizes a neighborhood-driven dynamic constraint mechanism to systematically capture implicit cross-view semantic correlations, consequently improving cross-view feature alignment. To further stabilize and strengthen the self-supervised training process, a pseudo-label enhancement strategy is introduced to enhance the quality of pseudo supervision. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised methods and even surpasses several state-of-the-art supervised methods. {Our code is available at https://github.com/ISChenawei/DMNIL.

Abstract: Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) aims to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet its effectiveness is often compromised by corrupted datasets with issues such as hallucinated content, incorrect responses, and poor OCR quality. Previous approaches to address these challenges have focused on refining datasets through high-quality data collection or rule-based filtering that can be costly or limited in scope. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into the impact of corrupted data on MLLMs and discover that, although corrupted data degrade model performance, such adverse effects are largely reversible, and MLLMs are {\bf corrupted but not broken}. Specifically, we find that disabling a small subset of parameters can almost fully restore performance. Moreover, corrupted MLLMs inherently possess the capability to differentiate between clean and corrupted samples, facilitating dataset cleaning without external intervention. Building on these insights, we introduce a corruption-robust training paradigm that significantly surpasses existing strategies for mitigating the effects of corrupted data.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful framework for machine learning interpretability, enabling the unsupervised decomposition of model representations into a dictionary of abstract, human-interpretable concepts. However, we reveal a fundamental limitation: existing SAEs exhibit severe instability, as identical models trained on similar datasets can produce sharply different dictionaries, undermining their reliability as an interpretability tool. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the Archetypal Analysis framework introduced by Cutler & Breiman (1994) and present Archetypal SAEs (A-SAE), wherein dictionary atoms are constrained to the convex hull of data. This geometric anchoring significantly enhances the stability of inferred dictionaries, and their mildly relaxed variants RA-SAEs further match state-of-the-art reconstruction abilities. To rigorously assess dictionary quality learned by SAEs, we introduce two new benchmarks that test (i) plausibility, if dictionaries recover "true" classification directions and (ii) identifiability, if dictionaries disentangle synthetic concept mixtures. Across all evaluations, RA-SAEs consistently yield more structured representations while uncovering novel, semantically meaningful concepts in large-scale vision models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress across various visual generation tasks. However, their performance significantly declines when generating content at resolutions higher than those used during training. Although numerous methods have been proposed to enable high-resolution generation, they all suffer from inefficiency. In this paper, we propose RectifiedHR, a straightforward and efficient solution for training-free high-resolution synthesis. Specifically, we propose a noise refresh strategy that unlocks the model's training-free high-resolution synthesis capability and improves efficiency. Additionally, we are the first to observe the phenomenon of energy decay, which may cause image blurriness during the high-resolution synthesis process. To address this issue, we introduce average latent energy analysis and find that tuning the classifier-free guidance hyperparameter can significantly improve generation performance. Our method is entirely training-free and demonstrates efficient performance. Furthermore, we show that RectifiedHR is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as image editing, customized generation, and video synthesis. Extensive comparisons with numerous baseline methods validate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of RectifiedHR.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have achieved promising results in natural language processing. However, for image generation tasks, they encounter substantial challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies, managing computational costs, and most crucially, defining meaningful autoregressive sequences that reflect natural image hierarchies. To address these issues, we present \textbf{N}ext-\textbf{F}requency \textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. Our approach first generates low-frequency components to establish global structure with fewer tokens, then progressively adds higher-frequency details, following the natural spectral hierarchy of images. This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves the quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships between image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient solution for image generation, with 1.25$\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20 while achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. We hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide autoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research. We will make our code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary object detectors can generalize to an unrestricted set of categories through simple textual prompting. However, adapting these models to rare classes or reinforcing their abilities on multiple specialized domains remains essential. While recent methods rely on monolithic adaptation strategies with a single set of weights, we embrace modular deep learning. We introduce DitHub, a framework designed to build and maintain a library of efficient adaptation modules. Inspired by Version Control Systems, DitHub manages expert modules as branches that can be fetched and merged as needed. This modular approach allows us to conduct an in-depth exploration of the compositional properties of adaptation modules, marking the first such study in Object Detection. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ODinW-13 benchmark and ODinW-O, a newly introduced benchmark designed to assess class reappearance.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models exhibit impressive photorealistic image generation capabilities, yet they struggle in compositional image generation. In this work, we introduce RoleBench, a benchmark focused on evaluating compositional generalization in action-based relations (e.g., "mouse chasing cat"). We show that state-of-the-art T2I models and compositional approaches consistently default to frequent reversed relations (i.e., cat chasing mouse), a phenomenon we call RoleCollapse. Related works attribute this to the model's architectural limitation or being underrepresented in the data. Our key insight reveals that while models fail on rare compositions when their inversions are common, they can successfully generate similar intermediate compositions (e.g., "mouse chasing boy"), suggesting that this limitation is due to the presence of frequent counterparts rather than the absence of rare compositions. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that directional decomposition can gradually mitigate role collapse. We test this via ReBind, a lightweight framework that teaches role bindings using carefully selected active/passive intermediaries. Experiments suggest that intermediate compositions through intermediate fine-tuning can significantly mitigate role bias, with humans preferring more than 78% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the role of distributional asymmetries in compositional failures and offer a simple, effective path to improving generalization.

Abstract: Visual classifiers provide high-dimensional feature representations that are challenging to interpret and analyze. Text, in contrast, provides a more expressive and human-friendly interpretable medium for understanding and analyzing model behavior. We propose a simple, yet powerful method for reformulating any pretrained visual classifier so that it can be queried with free-form text without compromising its original performance. Our approach is label-free, data and compute-efficient, and is trained to preserve the underlying classifiers distribution and decision-making processes. Our method unlocks several zero-shot text interpretability applications for any visual classifier. We apply our method on 40 visual classifiers and demonstrate two primary applications: 1) building both label-free and zero-shot concept bottleneck models and therefore converting any visual classifier to be inherently-interpretable and 2) zero-shot decoding of visual features into natural language sentences. In both tasks we establish new state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing works and surpassing CLIP-based baselines with ImageNet-only trained classifiers, while using up to 400x fewer images and 400,000x less text during training.

Abstract: CLIP is one of the most popular foundational models and is heavily used for many vision-language tasks. However, little is known about the inner workings of CLIP. While recent work has proposed decomposition-based interpretability methods for identifying textual descriptions of attention heads in CLIP, the implications of conceptual consistency in these text labels on interpretability and model performance has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. We conduct extensive experiments on six different models from OpenAI and OpenCLIP which vary by size, type of pre-training data and patch size. We propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. To assign concept labels to heads, we use in-context learning with ChatGPT, guided by a few manually-curated examples, and validate these labels using an LLM-as-a-judge approach. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. Moreover, we prove that high CCS heads learn spurious correlations amplifying social biases. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric exposing the paradox of performance and social biases in CLIP models.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models have demonstrated strong video understanding capabilities, yet their practical deployment is hindered by substantial inference costs caused by redundant video tokens. Existing pruning techniques fail to fully exploit the spatiotemporal redundancy inherent in video data. To bridge this gap, we perform a systematic analysis of video redundancy from two perspectives: temporal context and visual context. Leveraging these insights, we propose Dynamic Density Pruning for Fast Video LLMs termed FastVID. Specifically, FastVID dynamically partitions videos into temporally ordered segments to preserve temporal structure and applies a density-based token pruning strategy to maintain essential visual information. Our method significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining temporal and visual integrity. Extensive evaluations show that FastVID achieves state-of-the-art performance across various short- and long-video benchmarks on leading Video LLMs, including LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-Video. Notably, on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, FastVID effectively prunes $\textbf{90.3%}$ of video tokens, reduces FLOPs to $\textbf{8.3%}$, and accelerates the prefilling stage by $\textbf{7.1}\times$, while maintaining $\textbf{98.0%}$ of the original accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/LunarShen/FastVID.

<title>L2RSI: Cross-view LiDAR-based Place Recognition for Large-scale Urban Scenes via Remote Sensing Imagery</title>

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of LiDAR-based place recognition, which traditionally depends on costly and time-consuming prior 3D maps. To overcome this, we first construct XA-L\&amp;RSI dataset, which encompasses approximately $110,000$ remote sensing submaps and $13,000$ LiDAR point cloud submaps captured in urban scenes, and propose a novel method, L2RSI, for cross-view LiDAR place recognition using high-resolution Remote Sensing Imagery. This approach enables large-scale localization capabilities at a reduced cost by leveraging readily available overhead images as map proxies. L2RSI addresses the dual challenges of cross-view and cross-modal place recognition by learning feature alignment between point cloud submaps and remote sensing submaps in the semantic domain. Additionally, we introduce a novel probability propagation method based on particle estimation to refine position predictions, effectively leveraging temporal and spatial information. This approach enables large-scale retrieval and cross-scene generalization without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on XA-L\&amp;RSI demonstrate that, within a $100km^2$ retrieval range, L2RSI accurately localizes $83.27\%$ of point cloud submaps within a $30m$ radius for top-$1$ retrieved location. We provide a video to more vividly display the place recognition results of L2RSI at https://shizw695.github.io/L2RSI/.

Abstract: In industrial X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), the need for rapid in-line inspection is critical. Sparse-angle tomography plays a significant role in this by reducing the required number of projections, thereby accelerating processing and conserving resources. Most existing methods aim to balance reconstruction quality and scanning time, typically relying on fixed scan durations. Adaptive adjustment of the number of angles is essential; for instance, more angles may be required for objects with complex geometries or noisier projections. The concept of optimal stopping, which dynamically adjusts this balance according to varying industrial needs, remains overlooked. Building on our previous work, we integrate optimal stopping into sequential Optimal Experimental Design (sOED) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). We propose a novel method for computing the policy gradient within the Actor-Critic framework, enabling the development of adaptive policies for informative angle selection and scan termination. Additionally, we investigate the gap between simulation and real-world applications in the context of the developed learning-based method. Our trained model, developed using synthetic data, demonstrates reliable performance when applied to experimental X-ray CT data. This approach enhances the flexibility of CT operations and expands the applicability of sparse-angle tomography in industrial settings.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables rapid differentiable rendering for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, leading to its widespread commercial use. Consequently, copyright protection via watermarking has become critical. However, because 3DGS relies on millions of Gaussians, which require gigabytes of storage, efficient transfer and storage require compression. Existing 3DGS watermarking methods are vulnerable to quantization-based compression, often resulting in the loss of the embedded watermark. To address this challenge, we propose a novel watermarking method that ensures watermark robustness after model compression while maintaining high rendering quality. In detail, we incorporate a quantization distortion layer that simulates compression during training, preserving the watermark under quantization-based compression. Also, we propose a learnable watermark embedding feature that embeds the watermark into the anchor feature, ensuring structural consistency and seamless integration into the 3D scene. Furthermore, we present a frequency-aware anchor growing mechanism to enhance image quality in high-frequency regions by effectively identifying Guassians within these regions. Experimental results confirm that our method preserves the watermark and maintains superior image quality under high compression, validating it as a promising approach for a secure 3DGS model.

Abstract: 3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), the task of locating specific video segments based on language queries, is a core challenge in long-form video understanding. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown early promise in tackling TVG through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), their abilities to generalize remain limited. To address this, we propose a novel post-training framework that enhances the generalization capabilities of LVLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our contributions span three key directions: (1) Time-R1: we introduce a reasoning-guided post-training framework via RL with verifiable reward to enhance the capabilities of LVLMs on the TVG task. (2) TimeRFT: we explore data-efficient post-training strategies on our curated RL-friendly dataset, which trains the model to progressively comprehend difficult samples, leading to better generalization. (3) TVGBench: we carefully construct a small yet comprehensive benchmark for LVLM evaluation, assessing 11 types of queries and featuring balanced distributions across both videos and queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream datasets using only 2.5K training data, while improving its general video understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Conditional human animation traditionally animates static reference images using pose-based motion cues extracted from video data. However, these video-derived cues often suffer from low temporal resolution, motion blur, and unreliable performance under challenging lighting conditions. In contrast, event cameras inherently provide robust and high temporal-resolution motion information, offering resilience to motion blur, low-light environments, and exposure variations. In this paper, we propose EvAnimate, the first method leveraging event streams as robust and precise motion cues for conditional human image animation. Our approach is fully compatible with diffusion-based generative models, enabled by encoding asynchronous event data into a specialized three-channel representation with adaptive slicing rates and densities. High-quality and temporally coherent animations are achieved through a dual-branch architecture explicitly designed to exploit event-driven dynamics, significantly enhancing performance under challenging real-world conditions. Enhanced cross-subject generalization is further achieved using specialized augmentation strategies. To facilitate future research, we establish a new benchmarking, including simulated event data for training and validation, and a real-world event dataset capturing human actions under normal and challenging scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate that EvAnimate achieves high temporal fidelity and robust performance in scenarios where traditional video-derived cues fall short.

<title>Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Generation and Rollover Budget Forcing</title>

Abstract: We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D visual grounding is critical for autonomous driving vehicles to interpret natural languages and localize target objects in complex environments. However, existing datasets and methods suffer from coarse-grained language instructions, and inadequate integration of 3D geometric reasoning with linguistic comprehension. To this end, we introduce NuGrounding, the first large-scale benchmark for multi-view 3D visual grounding in autonomous driving. We present a Hierarchy of Grounding (HoG) method to construct NuGrounding to generate hierarchical multi-level instructions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of human instruction patterns. To tackle this challenging dataset, we propose a novel paradigm that seamlessly combines instruction comprehension abilities of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) with precise localization abilities of specialist detection models. Our approach introduces two decoupled task tokens and a context query to aggregate 3D geometric information and semantic instructions, followed by a fusion decoder to refine spatial-semantic feature fusion for precise localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines adapted from representative 3D scene understanding methods by a significant margin and achieves 0.59 in precision and 0.64 in recall, with improvements of 50.8% and 54.7%.

Abstract: Recently, multi-view or 4D video generation has emerged as a significant research topic. Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in LVLMs have improved vision-language understanding, but they still struggle with spatial perception, limiting their ability to reason about complex 3D scenes. Unlike previous approaches that incorporate 3D representations into models to improve spatial understanding, we aim to unlock the potential of VLMs by leveraging spatially relevant image data. To this end, we introduce a novel 2D spatial data generation and annotation pipeline built upon scene data with 3D ground-truth. This pipeline enables the creation of a diverse set of spatial tasks, ranging from basic perception tasks to more complex reasoning tasks. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct SPAR-7M, a large-scale dataset generated from thousands of scenes across multiple public datasets. In addition, we introduce SPAR-Bench, a benchmark designed to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of spatial capabilities compared to existing spatial benchmarks, supporting both single-view and multi-view inputs. Training on both SPAR-7M and large-scale 2D datasets enables our models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 2D spatial benchmarks. Further fine-tuning on 3D task-specific datasets yields competitive results, underscoring the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Radar is an important sensor for autonomous driving (AD) systems due to its robustness to adverse weather and different lighting conditions. Novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) has recently received considerable attention in AD due to its potential to enable efficient testing and validation but remains unexplored for radar point clouds. In this paper, we present NeuRadar, a NeRF-based model that jointly generates radar point clouds, camera images, and lidar point clouds. We explore set-based object detection methods such as DETR, and propose an encoder-based solution grounded in the NeRF geometry for improved generalizability. We propose both a deterministic and a probabilistic point cloud representation to accurately model the radar behavior, with the latter being able to capture radar's stochastic behavior. We achieve realistic reconstruction results for two automotive datasets, establishing a baseline for NeRF-based radar point cloud simulation models. In addition, we release radar data for ZOD's Sequences and Drives to enable further research in this field. To encourage further development of radar NeRFs, we release the source code for NeuRadar.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have achieved remarkable success in a variety of image tasks, yet achieving fine-grained, disentangled control over global structures versus fine details remains challenging. This paper explores frequency-based control within latent diffusion models. We first systematically analyze frequency characteristics across pixel space, VAE latent space, and internal LDM representations. This reveals that the "noise difference" term, derived from classifier-free guidance at each step t, is a uniquely effective and semantically rich target for manipulation. Building on this insight, we introduce FreSca, a novel and plug-and-play framework that decomposes noise difference into low- and high-frequency components and applies independent scaling factors to them via spatial or energy-based cutoffs. Essentially, FreSca operates without any model retraining or architectural change, offering model- and task-agnostic control. We demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness in improving generation quality and structural emphasis on multiple architectures (e.g., SD3, SDXL) and across applications including image generation, editing, depth estimation, and video synthesis, thereby unlocking a new dimension of expressive control within LDMs.

Abstract: Large Multi-modality Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in visual understanding and generation, but they still face challenges in General Visual Editing, particularly in following complex instructions, preserving appearance consistency, and supporting flexible input formats. To study this gap, we introduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed viSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning categories: Temporal, Causal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for each category and propose an robust evaluation framework that assesses Instruction Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human judges and the LMM-as-a-judge approach. We conducted experiments evaluating nine prominent visual editing models, comprising both open-source and proprietary models. The evaluation results demonstrate that current models face significant challenges in reasoning-based editing tasks. Even the most powerful model evaluated, GPT-4o-Image, achieves an accuracy of merely 28.8%. RISEBench effectively highlights the limitations of contemporary editing models, provides valuable insights, and indicates potential future directions for the field of reasoning-aware visual editing. Our code and data have been released at https://github.com/PhoenixZ810/RISEBench.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an important image format widely adopted in graphic design because of their resolution independence and editability. The study of generating high-quality SVG has continuously drawn attention from both designers and researchers in the AIGC community. However, existing methods either produces unstructured outputs with huge computational cost or is limited to generating monochrome icons of over-simplified structures. To produce high-quality and complex SVG, we propose OmniSVG, a unified framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for end-to-end multimodal SVG generation. By parameterizing SVG commands and coordinates into discrete tokens, OmniSVG decouples structural logic from low-level geometry for efficient training while maintaining the expressiveness of complex SVG structure. To further advance the development of SVG synthesis, we introduce MMSVG-2M, a multimodal dataset with two million richly annotated SVG assets, along with a standardized evaluation protocol for conditional SVG generation tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniSVG outperforms existing methods and demonstrates its potential for integration into professional SVG design workflows.

Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation presents challenges in diverse scenarios such as crowded scenes, person-person interactions, and single-view reconstruction. Existing approaches lack mechanisms to incorporate auxiliary "side information" that could enhance reconstruction accuracy in such challenging scenarios. Furthermore, the most accurate methods rely on cropped person detections and cannot exploit scene context while methods that process the whole image often fail to detect people and are less accurate than methods that use crops. While recent language-based methods explore HPS reasoning through large language or vision-language models, their metric accuracy is well below the state of the art. In contrast, we present PromptHMR, a transformer-based promptable method that reformulates HPS estimation through spatial and semantic prompts. Our method processes full images to maintain scene context and accepts multiple input modalities: spatial prompts like bounding boxes and masks, and semantic prompts like language descriptions or interaction labels. PromptHMR demonstrates robust performance across challenging scenarios: estimating people from bounding boxes as small as faces in crowded scenes, improving body shape estimation through language descriptions, modeling person-person interactions, and producing temporally coherent motions in videos. Experiments on benchmarks show that PromptHMR achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering flexible prompt-based control over the HPS estimation process.

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion aims to synthesize a single, comprehensive image from multiple source inputs. Traditional approaches, such as CNNs and GANs, offer efficiency but struggle to handle low-quality or complex inputs. Recent advances in text-guided methods leverage large model priors to overcome these limitations, but at the cost of significant computational overhead, both in memory and inference time. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for distilling large model priors, eliminating the need for text guidance during inference while dramatically reducing model size. Our framework utilizes a teacher-student architecture, where the teacher network incorporates large model priors and transfers this knowledge to a smaller student network via a tailored distillation process. Additionally, we introduce spatial-channel cross-fusion module to enhance the model's ability to leverage textual priors across both spatial and channel dimensions. Our method achieves a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and fusion quality. The distilled network, requiring only 10% of the parameters and inference time of the teacher network, retains 90% of its performance and outperforms existing SOTA methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The implementation will be made publicly available as an open-source resource.

However, their high computational demands pose challenges for real-time applications. This has led to a growing focus on developing efficient vision language models. In this survey, we review key techniques for optimizing VLMs on edge and resource-constrained devices. We also explore compact VLM architectures, frameworks and provide detailed insights into the performance-memory trade-offs of efficient VLMs. Furthermore, we establish a GitHub repository at https://github.com/MPSCUMBC/Efficient-Vision-Language-Models-A-Survey to compile all surveyed papers, which we will actively update. Our objective is to foster deeper research in this area.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (SSSS) aims to improve segmentation accuracy by leveraging a small set of labeled images alongside a larger pool of unlabeled data. Recent advances primarily focus on pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, and co-training strategies. However, existing methods struggle to balance global semantic representation with fine-grained local feature extraction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel tri-branch semi-supervised segmentation framework incorporating a dual-teacher strategy, named IGL-DT. Our approach employs SwinUnet for high-level semantic guidance through Global Context Learning and ResUnet for detailed feature refinement via Local Regional Learning. Additionally, a Discrepancy Learning mechanism mitigates over-reliance on a single teacher, promoting adaptive feature learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior segmentation performance across various data regimes.

Abstract: Traditional text-based person ReID assumes that person descriptions from witnesses are complete and provided at once. However, in real-world scenarios, such descriptions are often partial or vague. To address this limitation, we introduce a new task called interactive person re-identification (Inter-ReID). Inter-ReID is a dialogue-based retrieval task that iteratively refines initial descriptions through ongoing interactions with the witnesses. To facilitate the study of this new task, we construct a dialogue dataset that incorporates multiple types of questions by decomposing fine-grained attributes of individuals. We further propose LLaVA-ReID, a question model that generates targeted questions based on visual and textual contexts to elicit additional details about the target person. Leveraging a looking-forward strategy, we prioritize the most informative questions as supervision during training. Experimental results on both Inter-ReID and text-based ReID benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-ReID significantly outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Gaze estimation, which predicts gaze direction, commonly faces the challenge of interference from complex gaze-irrelevant information in face images. In this work, we propose DMAGaze, a novel gaze estimation framework that exploits information from facial images in three aspects: gaze-relevant global features (disentangled from facial image), local eye features (extracted from cropped eye patch), and head pose estimation features, to improve overall performance. Firstly, we design a new continuous mask-based Disentangler to accurately disentangle gaze-relevant and gaze-irrelevant information in facial images by achieving the dual-branch disentanglement goal through separately reconstructing the eye and non-eye regions. Furthermore, we introduce a new cascaded attention module named Multi-Scale Global Local Attention Module (MS-GLAM). Through a customized cascaded attention structure, it effectively focuses on global and local information at multiple scales, further enhancing the information from the Disentangler. Finally, the global gaze-relevant features disentangled by the upper face branch, combined with head pose and local eye features, are passed through the detection head for high-precision gaze estimation. Our proposed DMAGaze has been extensively validated on two mainstream public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have strengthened the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, enhancing policy exploration to better scale test-time compute remains largely underexplored. In addition, VLMs continue to struggle with imperfect visual perception, which in turn affects the subsequent reasoning process. To this end, we propose NoisyRollout, a simple yet effective data augmentation method that mixes trajectories from both clean and moderately distorted images during RL training. By injecting targeted diversity in visual perception and the resulting reasoning patterns, NoisyRollout promotes better policy exploration through vision-oriented inductive biases, ultimately leading to more robust reasoning behaviors. We further adopt a noise annealing schedule that gradually reduces distortion strength over training, leveraging noisy signals early on while ensuring training stability in later stages. Crucially, our method is easy-to-adopt--requiring no additional training cost and no modifications to the RL objective. Extensive experiments on $2$ distinct training datasets demonstrate that NoisyRollout achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source RL-tuned models across $5$ out-of-domain reasoning and perception benchmarks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of NoisyRollout across model sizes ($7$B and $32$B) and data scales (from $1$K to $6$K), highlighting its generalizability and scalability.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in psychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models often struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance. To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal cues, which allows the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, Mirror (Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance), which is a novel synthetic dataset that pairs each client's statements with corresponding facial images. Using this dataset, we train baseline vision language models (VLMs) so that they can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses to effectively manage client resistance. These models are then evaluated in terms of both their counseling skills as a therapist, and the strength of therapeutic alliance in the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches. Human expert evaluations further confirm the effectiveness of our approach in managing client resistance and fostering therapeutic alliance.

<title>Beyond One-Hot Labels: Semantic Mixing for Model Calibration</title>

Abstract: Model calibration seeks to ensure that models produce confidence scores that accurately reflect the true likelihood of their predictions being correct. However, existing calibration approaches are fundamentally tied to datasets of one-hot labels implicitly assuming full certainty in all the annotations. Such datasets are effective for classification but provides insufficient knowledge of uncertainty for model calibration, necessitating the curation of datasets with numerically rich ground-truth confidence values. However, due to the scarcity of uncertain visual examples, such samples are not easily available as real datasets. In this paper, we introduce calibration-aware data augmentation to create synthetic datasets of diverse samples and their ground-truth uncertainty. Specifically, we present \textbf{Calibration-aware Semantic Mixing (CSM)}, a novel framework that generates training samples with mixed class characteristics and annotates them with distinct confidence scores via diffusion models. Based on this framework, we propose calibrated reannotation to tackle the misalignment between the annotated confidence score and the mixing ratio during the diffusion reverse process. Besides, we explore the loss functions that better fit the new data representation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that CSM achieves superior calibration compared to the state-of-the-art calibration approaches. Our code is \href{https://github.com/E-Galois/CSM}{available here}.

Abstract: Next-token prediction is the fundamental principle for training large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their reasoning performance. As an effective way to model language, image, video, and other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm, while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. We design a set of graph-centric rewards, including three recall-based variants -- Hard Recall, Hard Recall+Relax, and Soft Recall -- which evaluate semantic and spatial alignment between predictions and ground truth at the object and relation levels. A format consistency reward further ensures that outputs follow the expected structural schema. Extensive experiments on the VG150 and PSG benchmarks show that R1-SGG substantially reduces failure rates and achieves strong performance in Recall and mean Recall, surpassing traditional SGG models and existing multimodal language models.

<title>DiMeR: Disentangled Mesh Reconstruction Model</title>

Abstract: We propose DiMeR, a novel geometry-texture disentangled feed-forward model with 3D supervision for sparse-view mesh reconstruction. Existing methods confront two persistent obstacles: (i) textures can conceal geometric errors, i.e., visually plausible images can be rendered even with wrong geometry, producing multiple ambiguous optimization objectives in geometry-texture mixed solution space for similar objects; and (ii) prevailing mesh extraction methods are redundant, unstable, and lack 3D supervision. To solve these challenges, we rethink the inductive bias for mesh reconstruction. First, we disentangle the unified geometry-texture solution space, where a single input admits multiple feasible solutions, into geometry and texture spaces individually. Specifically, given that normal maps are strictly consistent with geometry and accurately capture surface variations, the normal maps serve as the sole input for geometry prediction in DiMeR, while the texture is estimated from RGB images. Second, we streamline the algorithm of mesh extraction by eliminating modules with low performance/cost ratios and redesigning regularization losses with 3D supervision. Notably, DiMeR still accepts raw RGB images as input by leveraging foundation models for normal prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiMeR generalises across sparse-view-, single-image-, and text-to-3D tasks, consistently outperforming baselines. On the GSO and OmniObject3D datasets, DiMeR significantly reduces Chamfer Distance by more than 30%.

Abstract: To support the Low Altitude Economy (LAE), it is essential to achieve precise localization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban areas where global positioning system (GPS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based methods offer a viable alternative but face severe bandwidth, memory and processing constraints on lightweight UAVs. Inspired by mammalian spatial cognition, we propose a task-oriented communication framework, where UAVs equipped with multi-camera systems extract compact multi-view features and offload localization tasks to edge servers. We introduce the Orthogonally-constrained Variational Information Bottleneck encoder (O-VIB), which incorporates automatic relevance determination (ARD) to prune non-informative features while enforcing orthogonality to minimize redundancy. This enables efficient and accurate localization with minimal transmission cost. Extensive evaluation on a dedicated LAE UAV dataset shows that O-VIB achieves high-precision localization under stringent bandwidth budgets. Code and dataset will be made publicly available at: github.com/fangzr/TOC-Edge-Aerial.

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential approach is to utilize Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to build a self-correction framework. However, these approaches are highly dependent on the capabilities of the employed MLLM, often failing to account for all objects within the image. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that employs Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting, enhancing image-text alignment and facilitating more coherent multi-object image editing. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing the self-correction task into object-level subtasks according to three critical dimensions: counting, attributes, and spatial relationships. We construct a multi-agent self-correcting system featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To resolve the problem of subtask integration, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother that employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtask results, thereby enhancing runtime efficiency while eliminating multi-stage distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.

Abstract: Interactive 3D segmentation has emerged as a promising solution for generating accurate object masks in complex 3D scenes by incorporating user-provided clicks. However, two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) effectively generalizing from sparse user clicks to produce accurate segmentation, and (2) quantifying predictive uncertainty to help users identify unreliable regions. In this work, we propose NPISeg3D, a novel probabilistic framework that builds upon Neural Processes (NPs) to address these challenges. Specifically, NPISeg3D introduces a hierarchical latent variable structure with scene-specific and object-specific latent variables to enhance few-shot generalization by capturing both global context and object-specific characteristics. Additionally, we design a probabilistic prototype modulator that adaptively modulates click prototypes with object-specific latent variables, improving the model's ability to capture object-aware context and quantify predictive uncertainty. Experiments on four 3D point cloud datasets demonstrate that NPISeg3D achieves superior segmentation performance with fewer clicks while providing reliable uncertainty estimations.

Abstract: Pre-trained 3D vision models have gained significant attention for their promising performance on point cloud data. However, fully fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks is computationally expensive and storage-intensive. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches, which focus primarily on input token prompting, struggle to achieve competitive performance due to their limited ability to capture the geometric information inherent in point clouds. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Geometry-Aware Point Cloud Prompt (GAPrompt) that leverages geometric cues to enhance the adaptability of 3D vision models. First, we introduce a Point Prompt that serves as an auxiliary input alongside the original point cloud, explicitly guiding the model to capture fine-grained geometric details. Additionally, we present a Point Shift Prompter designed to extract global shape information from the point cloud, enabling instance-specific geometric adjustments at the input level. Moreover, our proposed Prompt Propagation mechanism incorporates the shape information into the model's feature extraction process, further strengthening its ability to capture essential geometric characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GAPrompt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods and achieves competitive results compared to full fine-tuning on various benchmarks, while utilizing only 2.19% of trainable parameters. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICML2025-VGP.

Abstract: Vision GNN (ViG) demonstrates superior performance by representing images as graph structures, providing a more natural way to capture irregular semantic patterns beyond traditional grid or sequence-based representations. To efficiently adapt ViG to downstream tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like visual prompting become increasingly essential. However, existing prompting methods are primarily designed for Transformer-based models, neglecting the rich topological relationships among nodes and edges in graph-based representations, limiting their capacity to model complex semantics. In this paper, we propose Vision Graph Prompting (VGP), a novel framework tailored for vision graph structures. Our core insight reveals that semantically connected components in the graph exhibit low-rank properties. Building on this observation, we introduce a semantic low-rank prompting method that decomposes low-rank semantic features and integrates them with prompts on vision graph topologies, capturing both global structural patterns and fine-grained semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method significantly improves ViG's transfer performance on diverse downstream tasks, achieving results comparable to full fine-tuning while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. However, most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly model the underlying structure/manifold in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating manifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often require expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we present $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$, which provides simplified training/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on multi-modal synthetic data and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$ exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training (up to $\sim 50\%$ less) and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models by incorporating extracted data features using pretrained lightweight latent variable models. Moving beyond natural images to generating fields arising from processes governed by physics, using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competitive approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features, which adds interpretability to the generation process.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an effective approach to improving visual classification. Existing studies typically enforce a one-step mapping that uses deep neural networks to project the visual features to mimic the distribution of textual features. However, they typically face difficulties in finding such a projection due to the two modalities in both the distribution of class-wise samples and the range of their feature values. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Semantic-Space-Intervened Diffusive Alignment method, termed SeDA, models a semantic space as a bridge in the visual-to-textual projection, considering both types of features share the same class-level information in classification. More importantly, a bi-stage diffusion framework is developed to enable the progressive alignment between the two modalities. Specifically, SeDA first employs a Diffusion-Controlled Semantic Learner to model the semantic features space of visual features by constraining the interactive features of the diffusion model and the category centers of visual features. In the later stage of SeDA, the Diffusion-Controlled Semantic Translator focuses on learning the distribution of textual features from the semantic space. Meanwhile, the Progressive Feature Interaction Network introduces stepwise feature interactions at each alignment step, progressively integrating textual information into mapped features. Experimental results show that SeDA achieves stronger cross-modal feature alignment, leading to superior performance over existing methods across multiple scenarios.

Abstract: Localized image captioning has made significant progress with models like the Describe Anything Model (DAM), which can generate detailed region-specific descriptions without explicit region-text supervision. However, such capabilities have yet to be widely applied to specialized domains like medical imaging, where diagnostic interpretation relies on subtle regional findings rather than global understanding. To mitigate this gap, we propose MedDAM, the first comprehensive framework leveraging large vision-language models for region-specific captioning in medical images. MedDAM employs medical expert-designed prompts tailored to specific imaging modalities and establishes a robust evaluation benchmark comprising a customized assessment protocol, data pre-processing pipeline, and specialized QA template library. This benchmark evaluates both MedDAM and other adaptable large vision-language models, focusing on clinical factuality through attribute-level verification tasks, thereby circumventing the absence of ground-truth region-caption pairs in medical datasets. Extensive experiments on the VinDr-CXR, LIDC-IDRI, and SkinCon datasets demonstrate MedDAM's superiority over leading peers (including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, LLaMA-3.2 Vision, Qwen2.5-VL, GPT-4Rol, and OMG-LLaVA) in the task, revealing the importance of region-level semantic alignment in medical image understanding and establishing MedDAM as a promising foundation for clinical vision-language integration.

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) and structural features (SFs) are cornerstones for the link prediction task. However, as a common and intuitive mode of understanding, the potential of visual perception has been overlooked in the MPNN community. For the first time, we equip MPNNs with vision structural awareness by proposing an effective framework called Graph Vision Network (GVN), along with a more efficient variant (E-GVN). Extensive empirical results demonstrate that with the proposed frameworks, GVN consistently benefits from the vision enhancement across seven link prediction datasets, including challenging large-scale graphs. Such improvements are compatible with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and GVNs achieve new SOTA results, thereby underscoring a promising novel direction for link prediction.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular topological structures (e.g., fissures and vasculature) is critical in various fields to guarantee dependable downstream quantitative analysis and modeling. However, in dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and super-resolution, conventional upsampling operators cannot accommodate the slenderness of tubular structures and the curvature of morphology. This paper introduces a dynamic snake upsampling operators and a boundary-skeleton weighted loss tailored for topological tubular structures. Specifically, we design a snake upsampling operators based on an adaptive sampling domain, which dynamically adjusts the sampling stride according to the feature map and selects a set of subpixel sampling points along the serpentine path, enabling more accurate subpixel-level feature recovery for tubular structures. Meanwhile, we propose a skeleton-to-boundary increasing weighted loss that trades off main body and boundary weight allocation based on mask class ratio and distance field, preserving main body overlap while enhancing focus on target topological continuity and boundary alignment precision. Experiments across various domain datasets and backbone networks show that this plug-and-play dynamic snake upsampling operator and boundary-skeleton weighted loss boost both pixel-wise segmentation accuracy and topological consistency of results.

Specifically, we embed watermarks into high-frequency sub-bands using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) and employ a Structural Consistency Graph Neural Network (SC-GNN) to preserve visual quality. We also design an attention module to refine embedding precision. Experimental results on face swap and reenactment tasks demonstrate that WaveGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both robustness and visual quality.

Abstract: This study introduces an enhanced approach to video super-resolution by extending ordinary Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) structure to handle spatio-temporal data. While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical, learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.

Abstract: Concept erasing has recently emerged as an effective paradigm to prevent text-to-image diffusion models from generating visually undesirable or even harmful content. However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually crafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure (efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In this paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text and image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled concept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address this, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision into the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative Concept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the concept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images induced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the target concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses the knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure efficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement strategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to the specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts. Finally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms state-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off between efficacy and usability.

Abstract: The goal of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is to imitate humans and surpass them. Models such as OpenAI's o1, o3, and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) with human-like reasoning capabilities exhibit exceptional performance and are being gradually integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, whether these models possess capabilities comparable to humans in handling reasoning tasks remains unclear at present. In this paper, we propose Human-Aligned Bench, a benchmark for fine-grained alignment of multimodal reasoning with human performance. Specifically, we collected 9,794 multimodal questions that solely rely on contextual reasoning, including bilingual (Chinese and English) multimodal questions and pure text-based questions, encompassing four question types: visual reasoning, definition judgment, analogical reasoning, and logical judgment. More importantly, each question is accompanied by human success rates and options that humans are prone to choosing incorrectly. Extensive experiments on the Human-Aligned Bench reveal notable differences between the performance of current MLLMs in multimodal reasoning and human performance. The findings on our benchmark provide insights into the development of the next-generation models.

Abstract: Event cameras, which capture brightness changes with high temporal resolution, inherently generate a significant amount of redundant and noisy data beyond essential object structures. The primary challenge in event-based object recognition lies in effectively removing this noise without losing critical spatial-temporal information. To address this, we propose an Adaptive Graph-based Noisy Data Removal framework for Event-based Object Recognition. Specifically, our approach integrates adaptive event segmentation based on normalized density analysis, a multifactorial edge-weighting mechanism, and adaptive graph-based denoising strategies. These innovations significantly enhance the integration of spatiotemporal information, effectively filtering noise while preserving critical structural features for robust recognition. Experimental evaluations on four challenging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior recognition accuracies of 83.77%, 76.79%, 99.30%, and 96.89%, surpassing existing graph-based methods by up to 8.79%, and improving noise reduction performance by up to 19.57%, with an additional accuracy gain of 6.26% compared to traditional Euclidean-based techniques.

<title>Unsupervised Detection of Distribution Shift in Inverse Problems using Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used as priors in imaging inverse problems. However, their performance often degrades under distribution shifts between the training and test-time images. Existing methods for identifying and quantifying distribution shifts typically require access to clean test images, which are almost never available while solving inverse problems (at test time). We propose a fully unsupervised metric for estimating distribution shifts using only indirect (corrupted) measurements and score functions from diffusion models trained on different datasets. We theoretically show that this metric estimates the KL divergence between the training and test image distributions. Empirically, we show that our score-based metric, using only corrupted measurements, closely approximates the KL divergence computed from clean images. Motivated by this result, we show that aligning the out-of-distribution score with the in-distribution score -- using only corrupted measurements -- reduces the KL divergence and leads to improved reconstruction quality across multiple inverse problems.

Abstract: Spike cameras offer unique sensing capabilities but their sparse, asynchronous output challenges semantic understanding, especially for Spike Video-Language Alignment (Spike-VLA) where models like CLIP underperform due to modality mismatch. We introduce SPKLIP, the first architecture specifically for Spike-VLA. SPKLIP employs a hierarchical spike feature extractor that adaptively models multi-scale temporal dynamics in event streams, and uses spike-text contrastive learning to directly align spike video with language, enabling effective few-shot learning. A full-spiking visual encoder variant, integrating SNN components into our pipeline, demonstrates enhanced energy efficiency. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on benchmark spike datasets and strong few-shot generalization on a newly contributed real-world dataset. SPKLIP's energy efficiency highlights its potential for neuromorphic deployment, advancing event-based multimodal research. The source code and dataset are available at [link removed for anonymity].

<title>FLASH: Latent-Aware Semi-Autoregressive Speculative Decoding for Multimodal Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large language and multimodal models (LLMs and LMMs) exhibit strong inference capabilities but are often limited by slow decoding speeds. This challenge is especially acute in LMMs, where visual inputs typically comprise more tokens with lower information density than text -- an issue exacerbated by recent trends toward finer-grained visual tokenizations to boost performance. Speculative decoding has been effective in accelerating LLM inference by using a smaller draft model to generate candidate tokens, which are then selectively verified by the target model, improving speed without sacrificing output quality. While this strategy has been extended to LMMs, existing methods largely overlook the unique properties of visual inputs and depend solely on text-based draft models. In this work, we propose \textbf{FLASH} (Fast Latent-Aware Semi-Autoregressive Heuristics), a speculative decoding framework designed specifically for LMMs, which leverages two key properties of multimodal data to design the draft model. First, to address redundancy in visual tokens, we propose a lightweight latent-aware token compression mechanism. Second, recognizing that visual objects often co-occur within a scene, we employ a semi-autoregressive decoding strategy to generate multiple tokens per forward pass. These innovations accelerate draft decoding while maintaining high acceptance rates, resulting in faster overall inference. Experiments show that FLASH significantly outperforms prior speculative decoding approaches in both unimodal and multimodal settings, achieving up to \textbf{2.68$\times$} speed-up on video captioning and \textbf{2.55$\times$} on visual instruction tuning tasks compared to the original LMM. Our code is available \href{https://github.com/ZihuaEvan/FlashSD/}{[here]}.

Abstract: 3D visual illusion is a perceptual phenomenon where a two-dimensional plane is manipulated to simulate three-dimensional spatial relationships, making a flat artwork or object look three-dimensional in the human visual system. In this paper, we reveal that the machine visual system is also seriously fooled by 3D visual illusions, including monocular and binocular depth estimation. In order to explore and analyze the impact of 3D visual illusion on depth estimation, we collect a large dataset containing almost 3k scenes and 200k images to train and evaluate SOTA monocular and binocular depth estimation methods. We also propose a robust depth estimation framework that uses common sense from a vision-language model to adaptively select reliable depth from binocular disparity and monocular depth. Experiments show that SOTA monocular, binocular, and multi-view depth estimation approaches are all fooled by various 3D visual illusions, while our method achieves SOTA performance.

Abstract: Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable, hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both} training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling of video diffusion models.

Abstract: Recently, the advent of vision Transformer (ViT) has brought substantial advancements in 3D dataset benchmarks, particularly in 3D volumetric medical image segmentation (Vol-MedSeg). Concurrently, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network has regained popularity among researchers due to their comparable results to ViT, albeit with the exclusion of the resource-intensive self-attention module. In this work, we propose a novel permutable hybrid network for Vol-MedSeg, named PHNet, which capitalizes on the strengths of both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and MLP. PHNet addresses the intrinsic isotropy problem of 3D volumetric data by employing a combination of 2D and 3D CNNs to extract local features. Besides, we propose an efficient multi-layer permute perceptron (MLPP) module that captures long-range dependence while preserving positional information. This is achieved through an axis decomposition operation that permutes the input tensor along different axes, thereby enabling the separate encoding of the positional information. Furthermore, MLPP tackles the resolution sensitivity issue of MLP in Vol-MedSeg with a token segmentation operation, which divides the feature into smaller tokens and processes them individually. Extensive experimental results validate that PHNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with lower computational costs on the widely-used yet challenging COVID-19-20 and Synapse benchmarks. The ablation study also demonstrates the effectiveness of PHNet in harnessing the strengths of both CNNs and MLP.

<title>GUARD: Role-playing to Generate Natural-language Jailbreakings to Test Guideline Adherence of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The discovery of "jailbreaks" to bypass safety filters of Large Language Models (LLMs) and harmful responses have encouraged the community to implement safety measures. One major safety measure is to proactively test the LLMs with jailbreaks prior to the release. Therefore, such testing will require a method that can generate jailbreaks massively and efficiently. In this paper, we follow a novel yet intuitive strategy to generate jailbreaks in the style of the human generation. We propose a role-playing system that assigns four different roles to the user LLMs to collaborate on new jailbreaks. Furthermore, we collect existing jailbreaks and split them into different independent characteristics using clustering frequency and semantic patterns sentence by sentence. We organize these characteristics into a knowledge graph, making them more accessible and easier to retrieve. Our system of different roles will leverage this knowledge graph to generate new jailbreaks, which have proved effective in inducing LLMs to generate unethical or guideline-violating responses. In addition, we also pioneer a setting in our system that will automatically follow the government-issued guidelines to generate jailbreaks to test whether LLMs follow the guidelines accordingly. We refer to our system as GUARD (Guideline Upholding through Adaptive Role-play Diagnostics). We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on three cutting-edge open-sourced LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, and Llama-2-7B), as well as a widely-utilized commercial LLM (ChatGPT). Moreover, our work extends to the realm of vision language models (MiniGPT-v2 and Gemini Vision Pro), showcasing GUARD's versatility and contributing valuable insights for the development of safer, more reliable LLM-based applications across diverse modalities.

<title>REAL: Representation Enhanced Analytic Learning for Exemplar-free Class-incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning (CIL) without available historical training samples as exemplars. Compared with its exemplar-based CIL counterpart that stores exemplars, EFCIL suffers more from forgetting issues. Recently, a new EFCIL branch named Analytic Continual Learning (ACL) introduces a gradient-free paradigm via Recursive Least-Square, achieving a forgetting-resistant classifier training with a frozen backbone during CIL. However, existing ACL suffers from ineffective representations and insufficient utilization of backbone knowledge. In this paper, we propose a representation-enhanced analytic learning (REAL) to address these problems. To enhance the representation, REAL constructs a dual-stream base pretraining followed by representation enhancing distillation process. The dual-stream base pretraining combines self-supervised contrastive learning for general features and supervised learning for class-specific knowledge, followed by the representation enhancing distillation to merge both streams, enhancing representations for subsequent CIL paradigm. To utilize more knowledge from the backbone, REAL presents a feature fusion buffer to multi-layer backbone features, providing informative features for the subsequent classifier training. Our method can be incorporated into existing ACL techniques and provides more competitive performance. Empirical results demonstrate that, REAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks, outperforming exemplar-free methods and rivaling exemplar-based approaches.

Abstract: Anatomical atlases are widely used for population studies and analysis. Conditional atlases target a specific sub-population defined via certain conditions, such as demographics or pathologies, and allow for the investigation of fine-grained anatomical differences like morphological changes associated with ageing or disease. Existing approaches use either registration-based methods that are often unable to handle large anatomical variations or generative adversarial models, which are challenging to train since they can suffer from training instabilities. Instead of generating atlases directly in as intensities, we propose using latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields, which transform a general population atlas into one representing a specific sub-population. Our approach ensures structural integrity, enhances interpretability and avoids hallucinations that may arise during direct image synthesis by generating this deformation field and regularising it using a neighbourhood of images. We compare our method to several state-of-the-art atlas generation methods using brain MR images from the UK Biobank. Our method generates highly realistic atlases with smooth transformations and high anatomical fidelity, outperforming existing baselines. We demonstrate the quality of these atlases through comprehensive evaluations, including quantitative metrics for anatomical accuracy, perceptual similarity, and qualitative analyses displaying the consistency and realism of the generated atlases.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of grasping transparent and specular objects. This issue holds importance, yet it remains unsolved within the field of robotics due to failure of recover their accurate geometry by depth cameras. For the first time, we propose ASGrasp, a 6-DoF grasp detection network that uses an RGB-D active stereo camera. ASGrasp utilizes a two-layer learning-based stereo network for the purpose of transparent object reconstruction, enabling material-agnostic object grasping in cluttered environments. In contrast to existing RGB-D based grasp detection methods, which heavily depend on depth restoration networks and the quality of depth maps generated by depth cameras, our system distinguishes itself by its ability to directly utilize raw IR and RGB images for transparent object geometry reconstruction. We create an extensive synthetic dataset through domain randomization, which is based on GraspNet-1Billion. Our experiments demonstrate that ASGrasp can achieve over 90% success rate for generalizable transparent object grasping in both simulation and the real via seamless sim-to-real transfer. Our method significantly outperforms SOTA networks and even surpasses the performance upper bound set by perfect visible point cloud inputs.Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/ASGrasp

Abstract: Resolving conflicts is critical for improving the reliability of multi-view classification. While prior work focuses on learning consistent and informative representations across views, it often assumes perfect alignment and equal importance of all views, an assumption rarely met in real-world scenarios, as some views may express distinct information. To address this, we develop a computational trust-based discounting method that enhances the Evidential Multi-view framework by accounting for the instance-wise reliability of each view through a probability-sensitive trust mechanism. We evaluate our method on six real-world datasets using Top-1 Accuracy, Fleiss' Kappa, and a new metric, Multi-View Agreement with Ground Truth, to assess prediction reliability. We also assess the effectiveness of uncertainty in indicating prediction correctness via AUROC.Additionally, we test the scalability of our method through end-to-end training on a large-scale dataset. The experimental results show that computational trust can effectively resolve conflicts, paving the way for more reliable multi-view classification models in real-world applications.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful technique employed for non-invasive in vivo visualization of internal structures. Sparsity is often deployed to accelerate the signal acquisition or overcome the presence of motion artifacts, improving the quality of image reconstruction. Image reconstruction algorithms use TV-regularized LASSO (Total Variation-regularized LASSO) to retrieve the missing information of undersampled signals, by cleaning the data of noise and while optimizing sparsity. A tuning parameter moderates the balance between these two aspects; its choice affecting the quality of the reconstructions. Currently, there is a lack of general deterministic techniques to choose these parameters, which are oftentimes manually selected and thus hinder the reliability of the reconstructions. Here, we present ALMA (Algorithm for Lagrange Multipliers Approximation), an iterative mathematics-inspired technique that computes tuning parameters for generalized LASSO problems during MRI reconstruction. We analyze quantitatively the performance of these parameters for imaging reconstructions via TV-LASSO in an MRI context on phantoms. Although our study concentrates on TV-LASSO, the techniques developed here hold significant promise for a wide array of applications. ALMA is not only adaptable to more generalized LASSO problems but is also robust to accommodate other forms of regularization beyond total variation. Moreover, it extends effectively to handle non-Cartesian sampling trajectories, broadening its utility in complex data reconstruction scenarios. More generally, ALMA provides a powerful tool for numerically solving constrained optimization problems across various disciplines, offering a versatile and impactful solution for advanced computational challenges.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning methods for movement recognition often struggle with limited model interpretability and a lack of insight into human movement dynamics. This study introduces a novel representation learning framework based on causal inference to address these challenges. Our two-stage approach combines the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to identify and quantify causal relationships between human joints. By capturing joint interactions, the proposed causal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) produces interpretable and robust representations. Experimental results on the EmoPain dataset demonstrate that the causal GCN outperforms traditional GCNs in accuracy, F1 score, and recall, particularly in detecting protective behaviors. This work contributes to advancing human motion analysis and lays a foundation for adaptive and intelligent healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Visual language is a system of communication that conveys information through symbols, shapes, and spatial arrangements. Diagrams are a typical example of a visual language depicting complex concepts and their relationships in the form of an image. The symbolic nature of diagrams presents significant challenges for building models capable of understanding them. Recent studies suggest that Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can even tackle complex reasoning tasks involving diagrams. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by developing a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the diagram comprehension capability of LVLMs. Our test suite uses a variety of questions focused on concept entities and their relationships over a set of synthetic as well as real diagrams across domains to evaluate the recognition and reasoning abilities of models. Our evaluation of LVLMs shows that while they can accurately identify and reason about entities, their ability to understand relationships is notably limited. Further testing reveals that the decent performance on diagram understanding largely stems from leveraging their background knowledge as shortcuts to identify and reason about the relational information. Thus, we conclude that LVLMs have a limited capability for genuine diagram understanding, and their impressive performance in diagram reasoning is an illusion emanating from other confounding factors, such as the background knowledge in the models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based extreme image compression methods have achieved impressive performance at extremely low bitrates. However, constrained by the iterative denoising process that starts from pure noise, these methods are limited in both fidelity and efficiency. To address these two issues, we present Relay Residual Diffusion Extreme Image Compression (RDEIC), which leverages compressed feature initialization and residual diffusion. Specifically, we first use the compressed latent features of the image with added noise, instead of pure noise, as the starting point to eliminate the unnecessary initial stages of the denoising process. Second, we directly derive a novel residual diffusion equation from Stable Diffusion's original diffusion equation that reconstructs the raw image by iteratively removing the added noise and the residual between the compressed and target latent features. In this way, we effectively combine the efficiency of residual diffusion with the powerful generative capability of Stable Diffusion. Third, we propose a fixed-step fine-tuning strategy to eliminate the discrepancy between the training and inference phases, thereby further improving the reconstruction quality.

<title>SITCOM: Step-wise Triple-Consistent Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative models that allow sampling from a distribution learned over a training set. When applied to solving inverse problems, the reverse sampling steps are modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (e.g., presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates our proposed step-wise and network-regularized backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions (implicitly or explicitly), our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to SOTA baselines, our experiments across several linear and non-linear tasks (with natural and medical images) demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard similarity metrics and run-time.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of scientific progress requires innovative tools that can accelerate knowledge discovery. Although recent AI methods, particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown promise in tasks such as hypothesis generation and experimental design, they fall short of replicating the collaborative nature of real-world scientific practices, where diverse experts work together in teams to tackle complex problems. To address the limitations, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent system, i.e., Virtual Scientists (VirSci), designed to mimic the teamwork inherent in scientific research. VirSci organizes a team of agents to collaboratively generate, evaluate, and refine research ideas. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that this multi-agent approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing novel scientific ideas. We further investigate the collaboration mechanisms that contribute to its tendency to produce ideas with higher novelty, offering valuable insights to guide future research and illuminating pathways toward building a robust system for autonomous scientific discovery.

Abstract: Diffusion models and flow-matching models have enabled generating diverse and realistic images by learning to transfer noise to data. However, sampling from these models involves iterative denoising over many neural network passes, making generation slow and expensive. Previous approaches for speeding up sampling require complex training regimes, such as multiple training phases, multiple networks, or fragile scheduling. We introduce shortcut models, a family of generative models that use a single network and training phase to produce high-quality samples in a single or multiple sampling steps. Shortcut models condition the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, allowing the model to skip ahead in the generation process. Across a wide range of sampling step budgets, shortcut models consistently produce higher quality samples than previous approaches, such as consistency models and reflow. Compared to distillation, shortcut models reduce complexity to a single network and training phase and additionally allow varying step budgets at inference time.

<title>Robust multi-coil MRI reconstruction via self-supervised denoising</title>

Abstract: We study the effect of incorporating self-supervised denoising as a pre-processing step for training deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods on data corrupted by Gaussian noise. K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB, 14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the quality of input data, denoising enables training more effective DL networks, potentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.

Abstract: Segmenting stroke lesions in MRI is challenging due to diverse acquisition protocols that limit model generalisability. In this work, we introduce two physics-constrained approaches to generate synthetic quantitative MRI (qMRI) images that improve segmentation robustness across heterogeneous domains. Our first method, $\texttt{qATLAS}$, trains a neural network to estimate qMRI maps from standard MPRAGE images, enabling the simulation of varied MRI sequences with realistic tissue contrasts. The second method, $\texttt{qSynth}$, synthesises qMRI maps directly from tissue labels using label-conditioned Gaussian mixture models, ensuring physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on multiple out-of-domain datasets show that both methods outperform a baseline UNet, with $\texttt{qSynth}$ notably surpassing previous synthetic data approaches. These results highlight the promise of integrating MRI physics into synthetic data generation for robust, generalisable stroke lesion segmentation.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Network (SNN), as a brain-inspired and energy-efficient network, is currently facing the pivotal challenge of exploring a suitable and efficient learning framework. The predominant training methodologies, namely Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) and ANN-SNN Conversion, are encumbered by substantial training overhead or pronounced inference latency, which impedes the advancement of SNNs in scaling to larger networks and navigating intricate application domains. In this work, we propose a novel parallel conversion learning framework, which establishes a mathematical mapping relationship between each time-step of the parallel spiking neurons and the cumulative spike firing rate. We theoretically validate the lossless and sorting properties of the conversion process, as well as pointing out the optimal shifting distance for each step. Furthermore, by integrating the above framework with the distribution-aware error calibration technique, we can achieve efficient conversion towards more general activation functions or training-free circumstance. Extensive experiments have confirmed the significant performance advantages of our method for various conversion cases under ultra-low time latency. To our best knowledge, this is the first work which jointly utilizes parallel spiking calculation and ANN-SNN Conversion, providing a highly promising approach for SNN supervised training.

Abstract: Modern robots vary significantly in shape, size, and sensor configurations used to perceive and interact with their environments. However, most navigation policies are embodiment-specific--a policy trained on one robot typically fails to generalize to another, even with minor changes in body size or camera viewpoint. As custom hardware becomes increasingly common, there is a growing need for a single policy that generalizes across embodiments, eliminating the need to retrain for each specific robot. In this paper, we introduce RING (Robotic Indoor Navigation Generalist), an embodiment-agnostic policy that turns any mobile robot into an effective indoor semantic navigator. Trained entirely in simulation, RING leverages large-scale randomization over robot embodiments to enable robust generalization to many real-world platforms. To support this, we augment the AI2-THOR simulator to instantiate robots with controllable configurations, varying in body size, rotation pivot point, and camera parameters. On the visual object-goal navigation task, RING achieves strong cross-embodiment (XE) generalization--72.1% average success rate across five simulated embodiments (a 16.7% absolute improvement on the Chores-S benchmark) and 78.9% across four real-world platforms, including Stretch RE-1, LoCoBot, and Unitree Go1--matching or even surpassing embodiment-specific policies. We further deploy RING on the RB-Y1 wheeled humanoid in a real-world kitchen environment, showcasing its out-of-the-box potential for mobile manipulation platforms.

Abstract: Recent advancements in omnimodal learning have significantly improved understanding and generation across images, text, and speech, yet these developments remain predominantly confined to proprietary models. The lack of high-quality omnimodal datasets and the challenges of real-time emotional speech synthesis have notably hindered progress in open-source research. To address these limitations, we introduce \name, a two-stage training framework that integrates omnimodal alignment and speech generation to develop a state-of-the-art omnimodal large language model. In the alignment phase, a pre-trained speech model undergoes further training on text-image tasks, enabling (near) zero-shot generalization from vision to speech, outperforming models trained on tri-modal datasets. In the speech generation phase, a lightweight decoder is trained on speech tasks with direct preference optimization, enabling real-time emotional speech synthesis with high fidelity. Experiments show that \name surpasses state-of-the-art models across omnimodal, vision-language, and speech-language benchmarks. It achieves a 4-point absolute improvement on OmniBench over the leading open-source model VITA, despite using 5x fewer training samples and a smaller model size (7B vs. 7x8B). Additionally, \name achieves real-time speech generation with <1s latency at non-autoregressive mode, reducing inference time by 5x compared to autoregressive methods, and improves emotion classification accuracy by 7.7\%

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer among men in the United States, accounting for nearly 300,000 cases, 29\% of all diagnoses and 35,000 total deaths in 2024. Traditional screening methods such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been pivotal in diagnosis, but have faced limitations in specificity and generalizability. In this paper, we explore the potential of enhancing PCa gland segmentation using a novel MRI modality called synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$). We employ several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including U-Net, SegResNet, Swin UNETR, Attention U-Net, and LightM-UNet, to segment prostate glands from a 200 CDI$^s$ patient cohort. We find that SegResNet achieved superior segmentation performance with a Dice-Sorensen coefficient (DSC) of $76.68 \pm 0.8$. Notably, the Attention U-Net, while slightly less accurate (DSC $74.82 \pm 2.0$), offered a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models in improving prostate gland segmentation using CDI$^s$ to enhance PCa management and clinical support.

Abstract: With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a promising technique for COVID-19 detection, due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and portability. In response, researchers have focused on developing AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support. However, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available ultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model. This paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for multi-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage self-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without label and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We show that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional fully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering classification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance enables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung pathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video classification tasks.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system. Multimodal MRI is widely used for the preliminary screening of gliomas and plays a crucial role in auxiliary diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy, and prognostic evaluation. Currently, the computer-aided diagnostic studies of gliomas using MRI have focused on independent analysis events such as tumor segmentation, grading, and radiogenomic classification, without studying inter-dependencies among these events. In this study, we propose a Glioma Multimodal MRI Analysis System (GMMAS) that utilizes a deep learning network for processing multiple events simultaneously, leveraging their inter-dependencies through an uncertainty-based multi-task learning architecture and synchronously outputting tumor region segmentation, glioma histological subtype, IDH mutation genotype, and 1p/19q chromosome disorder status. Compared with the reported single-task analysis models, GMMAS improves the precision across tumor layered diagnostic tasks. Additionally, we have employed a two-stage semi-supervised learning method, enhancing model performance by fully exploiting both labeled and unlabeled MRI samples. Further, by utilizing an adaptation module based on knowledge self-distillation and contrastive learning for cross-modal feature extraction, GMMAS exhibited robustness in situations of modality absence and revealed the differing significance of each MRI modal. Finally, based on the analysis outputs of the GMMAS, we created a visual and user-friendly platform for doctors and patients, introducing GMMAS-GPT to generate personalized prognosis evaluations and suggestions.

<title>Token Sampling Uncertainty Does Not Explain Homogeneity Bias in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Homogeneity bias is one form of stereotyping in AI models where certain groups are represented as more similar to each other than other groups. This bias is a major obstacle to creating equitable language technologies. We test whether the bias is driven by systematic differences in token-sampling uncertainty across six large language models. While we observe the presence of homogeneity bias using sentence similarity, we find very little difference in token sampling uncertainty across groups. This finding elucidates why temperature-based sampling adjustments fail to mitigate homogeneity bias. It suggests researchers should prioritize interventions targeting representation learning mechanisms and training corpus composition rather than inference-time output manipulations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of submissions to top-tier Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) conferences has prompted many venues to transition from closed to open review platforms. Some have fully embraced open peer reviews, allowing public visibility throughout the process, while others adopt hybrid approaches, such as releasing reviews only after final decisions or keeping reviews private despite using open peer review systems. In this work, we analyze the strengths and limitations of these models, highlighting the growing community interest in transparent peer review. To support this discussion, we examine insights from Paper Copilot, a website launched two years ago to aggregate and analyze AI / ML conference data while engaging a global audience. The site has attracted over 200,000 early-career researchers, particularly those aged 18-34 from 177 countries, many of whom are actively engaged in the peer review process. Drawing on our findings, this position paper advocates for a more transparent, open, and well-regulated peer review aiming to foster greater community involvement and propel advancements in the field.

Abstract: Which functions can be used as activations in deep neural networks? This article explores families of functions based on orthonormal bases, including the Hermite polynomial basis and the Fourier trigonometric basis, as well as a basis resulting from the tropicalization of a polynomial basis. Our study shows that, through simple variance-preserving initialization and without additional clamping mechanisms, these activations can successfully be used to train deep models, such as GPT-2 for next-token prediction on OpenWebText and ConvNeXt for image classification on ImageNet. Our work addresses the issue of exploding and vanishing activations and gradients, particularly prevalent with polynomial activations, and opens the door for improving the efficiency of large-scale learning tasks. Furthermore, our approach provides insight into the structure of neural networks, revealing that networks with polynomial activations can be interpreted as multivariate polynomial mappings. Finally, using Hermite interpolation, we show that our activations can closely approximate classical ones in pre-trained models by matching both the function and its derivative, making them especially useful for fine-tuning tasks. These activations are available in the torchortho library, which can be accessed via: https://github.com/K-H-Ismail/torchortho.

Abstract: Recent success in legged robot locomotion is attributed to the integration of reinforcement learning and physical simulators. However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.

DTM unifies a broad class of guidance methods and enables novel instantiations. We introduce a new method within this framework that achieves state-of-the-art results on several linear, non-linear, and blind inverse problems without requiring additional model training or specificity to pixel or latent space diffusion models.

Abstract: In image processing, solving inverse problems is the task of finding plausible reconstructions of an image that was corrupted by some (usually known) degradation operator. Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We name our method LD-SMC. We define a generative model for the data using additional auxiliary observations and perform posterior inference with SMC sampling based on a backward diffusion process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of LD-SMC over competing methods in various inverse problem tasks and especially in challenging inpainting tasks.

This paper introduces VISTA, a dataset specifically designed for video-to-text summarization in scientific domains. VISTA contains 18,599 recorded AI conference presentations paired with their corresponding paper abstracts. We benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art large models and apply a plan-based framework to better capture the structured nature of abstracts. Both human and automated evaluations confirm that explicit planning enhances summary quality and factual consistency. However, a considerable gap remains between models and human performance, highlighting the challenges of our dataset.

<title>Why Vision Language Models Struggle with Visual Arithmetic? Towards Enhanced Chart and Geometry Understanding</title>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, yet they often struggle with visual arithmetic, seemingly simple capabilities like object counting or length comparison, which are essential for relevant complex tasks like chart understanding and geometric reasoning. In this work, we first investigate the root causes of this deficiency through a suite of probing tasks focusing on basic visual arithmetic. Our analysis reveals that while pre-trained vision encoders typically capture sufficient information, the text decoder often fails to decode it correctly for arithmetic reasoning. To address this, we propose CogAlign, a novel post-training strategy inspired by Piaget's theory of cognitive development. CogAlign trains VLMs to recognize invariant properties under visual transformations. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of three diverse VLMs on our proposed probing tasks. Furthermore, CogAlign enhances performance by an average of 4.6% on CHOCOLATE and 2.9% on MATH-VISION, outperforming or matching supervised fine-tuning methods while requiring only 60% less training data. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of CogAlign in improving fundamental visual arithmetic capabilities and their transfer to downstream tasks.

<title>Natural Language Generation from Visual Events: Challenges and Future Directions</title>

Abstract: The ability to use natural language to talk about visual events is at the core of human intelligence and a crucial feature of any artificial intelligence system. In recent years, a substantial body of work in visually grounded NLP has focused on describing content depicted in single images. By contrast, comparatively less attention has been devoted to exhaustively modeling scenarios in which natural language is employed to interpret and talk about events presented through videos or sequences of images. In this position paper, we argue that any NLG task dealing with sequences of images or frames is an instance of the broader, more general problem of modeling the intricate relationships between visual events unfolding over time and the features of the language used to interpret, describe, or narrate them. Therefore, solving these tasks requires models to be capable of identifying and managing such intricacies. We consider five seemingly different tasks, which we argue are compelling instances of this broader multimodal problem. Consistently, we claim that these tasks pose a common set of challenges and share similarities in terms of modeling and evaluation approaches. Building on this perspective, we identify key open questions and propose several research directions for future investigation. We claim that improving language-and-vision models' understanding of visual events is both timely and essential, given their growing applications. Additionally, this challenge offers significant scientific insight, advancing model development through principles of human cognition and language use.

Abstract: Understanding domain-specific theorems often requires more than just text-based reasoning; effective communication through structured visual explanations is crucial for deeper comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in text-based theorem reasoning, their ability to generate coherent and pedagogically meaningful visual explanations remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce TheoremExplainAgent, an agentic approach for generating long-form theorem explanation videos (over 5 minutes) using Manim animations. To systematically evaluate multimodal theorem explanations, we propose TheoremExplainBench, a benchmark covering 240 theorems across multiple STEM disciplines, along with 5 automated evaluation metrics. Our results reveal that agentic planning is essential for generating detailed long-form videos, and the o3-mini agent achieves a success rate of 93.8% and an overall score of 0.77. However, our quantitative and qualitative studies show that most of the videos produced exhibit minor issues with visual element layout. Furthermore, multimodal explanations expose deeper reasoning flaws that text-based explanations fail to reveal, highlighting the importance of multimodal explanations.

Abstract: We present GenAnalysis, an implicit shape generation framework that allows joint analysis of man-made shapes, including shape matching and joint shape segmentation. The key idea is to enforce an as-affine-as-possible (AAAP) deformation between synthetic shapes of the implicit generator that are close to each other in the latent space, which we achieve by designing a regularization loss. It allows us to understand the shape variation of each shape in the context of neighboring shapes and also offers structure-preserving interpolations between the input shapes. We show how to extract these shape variations by recovering piecewise affine vector fields in the tangent space of each shape. These vector fields provide single-shape segmentation cues. We then derive shape correspondences by iteratively propagating AAAP deformations across a sequence of intermediate shapes. These correspondences are then used to aggregate single-shape segmentation cues into consistent segmentations. We conduct experiments on the ShapeNet dataset to show superior performance in shape matching and joint shape segmentation over previous methods.

Abstract: The DreamerV3 algorithm recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by learning an accurate world model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Following the success of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms and the rapid adoption of the Transformer architecture for its superior training efficiency and favorable scaling properties, recent works such as STORM have proposed replacing RNN-based world models with Transformer-based world models using masked self-attention. However, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their impact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm, struggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work, we show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches is insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of Transformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time horizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE Representations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive Coding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the agent performance. TWISTER achieves a human-normalized mean score of 162% on the Atari 100k benchmark, setting a new record among state-of-the-art methods that do not employ look-ahead search.

Abstract: The recent advancements in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices implementation allow us to study their application to real-life computational problems. However, hardware challenges are not the only ones that hinder our quantum computation capabilities. Software limitations are the other, less explored side of this medal. Using satellite image segmentation as a task example, we investigated how difficult it is to run a hybrid quantum-classical model on a real, publicly available quantum device. We also analyzed the costs of such endeavor and the change in quality of model.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) develop patch embedding and convolution backbone within vector space, especially Euclidean ones, at the very founding. When expanding VLMs to a galaxy scale for understanding astronomical phenomena, the integration of spherical space for planetary orbits and hyperbolic spaces for black holes raises two formidable challenges. a) The current pre-training model is confined to Euclidean space rather than a comprehensive geometric embedding. b) The predominant architecture lacks suitable backbones for anisotropic physical geometries. In this paper, we introduced Galaxy-Walker, a geometry-aware VLM, for the universe-level vision understanding tasks. We proposed the geometry prompt that generates geometry tokens by random walks across diverse spaces on a multi-scale physical graph, along with a geometry adapter that compresses and reshapes the space anisotropy in a mixture-of-experts manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with Galaxy-Walker achieving state-of-the-art performance in both galaxy property estimation ($R^2$ scores up to $0.91$) and morphology classification tasks (up to $+0.17$ F1 improvement in challenging features), significantly outperforming both domain-specific models and general-purpose VLMs.

Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize anatomical motion is becoming increasingly important when treating cancer patients with radiotherapy. Hybrid MRI-linear accelerator (MRI-linac) systems allow real-time motion management during irradiation. This paper presents a multi-institutional real-time MRI time series dataset from different MRI-linac vendors. The dataset is designed to support developing and evaluating real-time tumor localization (tracking) algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy within the TrackRAD2025 challenge (https://trackrad2025.grand-challenge.org/).
  Acquisition and validation methods: The dataset consists of sagittal 2D cine MRIs in 585 patients from six centers (3 Dutch, 1 German, 1 Australian, and 1 Chinese). Tumors in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis acquired on two commercially available MRI-linacs (0.35 T and 1.5 T) were included. For 108 cases, irradiation targets or tracking surrogates were manually segmented on each temporal frame. The dataset was randomly split into a public training set of 527 cases (477 unlabeled and 50 labeled) and a private testing set of 58 cases (all labeled).
  Data Format and Usage Notes: The data is publicly available under the TrackRAD2025 collection: https://doi.org/10.57967/hf/4539. Both the images and segmentations for each patient are available in metadata format.
  Potential Applications: This novel clinical dataset will enable the development and evaluation of real-time tumor localization algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy. By enabling more accurate motion management and adaptive treatment strategies, this dataset has the potential to advance the field of radiotherapy significantly.

Abstract: Face registration deforms a template mesh to closely fit a 3D face scan, the quality of which commonly degrades in non-skin regions (e.g., hair, beard, accessories), because the optimized template-to-scan distance pulls the template mesh towards the noisy scan surface. Improving registration quality requires a clean separation of skin and non-skin regions on the scan mesh. Existing image-based (2D) or scan-based (3D) segmentation methods however perform poorly. Image-based segmentation outputs multi-view inconsistent masks, and they cannot account for scan inaccuracies or scan-image misalignment, while scan-based methods suffer from lower spatial resolution compared to images. In this work, we introduce a novel method that accurately separates skin from non-skin geometry on 3D human head scans. For this, our method extracts features from multi-view images using a frozen image foundation model and aggregates these features in 3D. These lifted 2D features are then fused with 3D geometric features extracted from the scan mesh, to then predict a segmentation mask directly on the scan mesh. We show that our segmentations improve the registration accuracy over pure 2D or 3D segmentation methods by 8.89% and 14.3%, respectively. Although trained only on synthetic data, our model generalizes well to real data.

Abstract: Crucial in disease analysis and surgical planning, manual segmentation of volumetric medical scans (e.g. MRI, CT) is laborious, error-prone, and challenging to master, while fully automatic algorithms can benefit from user feedback. Therefore, with the complementary power of the latest radiological AI foundation models and virtual reality (VR)'s intuitive data interaction, we propose SAMIRA, a novel conversational AI agent for medical VR that assists users with localizing, segmenting, and visualizing 3D medical concepts. Through speech-based interaction, the agent helps users understand radiological features, locate clinical targets, and generate segmentation masks that can be refined with just a few point prompts. The system also supports true-to-scale 3D visualization of segmented pathology to enhance patient-specific anatomical understanding. Furthermore, to determine the optimal interaction paradigm under near-far attention-switching for refining segmentation masks in an immersive, human-in-the-loop workflow, we compare VR controller pointing, head pointing, and eye tracking as input modes. With a user study, evaluations demonstrated a high usability score (SUS=90.0 $\pm$ 9.0), low overall task load, as well as strong support for the proposed VR system's guidance, training potential, and integration of AI in radiological segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from basic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate human-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs; \textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs. Building on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a structured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers practitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure Computer-Using Agents.

Summary:<br /><br />
This study aims to explore the commonalities and distinctions among different data modalities by analyzing interpretable features extracted from multimodal models, with a focus on the CLIP model. The researchers introduce the Modality Dominance Score (MDS) to attribute features to specific modalities, categorizing them into vision, language, and visual-language classes. This categorization aligns with human intuitive understandings of modalities and can benefit various tasks, including reducing bias in gender detection and enabling modal-specific feature control in text-to-image generation. The study demonstrates that large-scale multimodal models, coupled with interpretability tools, provide valuable insights into the relationships between different data modalities. <div>

Abstract: Humans experience the world through multiple modalities, such as, vision, language, and speech, making it natural to explore the commonality and distinctions among them. In this work, we take a data-driven approach to address this question by analyzing interpretable, monosemantic features extracted from deep multimodal models. Specifically, we investigate CLIP, a prominent visual-language representation model trained on massive image-text pairs. Building on prior research in single-modal interpretability, we develop a set of multi-modal interpretability tools and measures designed to disentangle and analyze features learned from CLIP. Specifically, we introduce the Modality Dominance Score (MDS) to attribute each CLIP feature to a specific modality. We then map CLIP features into a more interpretable space, enabling us to categorize them into three distinct classes: vision features (single-modal), language features (single-modal), and visual-language features (cross-modal). Interestingly, this data-driven categorization closely aligns with human intuitive understandings of different modalities. We further show that this modality decomposition can benefit multiple downstream tasks, including reducing bias in gender detection, generating cross-modal adversarial examples, and enabling modal-specific feature control in text-to-image generation. These results indicate that large-scale multimodal models, when equipped with task-agnostic interpretability tools, can offer valuable insights into the relationships between different data modalities.

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras; (2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned TTI models.

Abstract: Unlike spoken languages where the use of prosodic features to convey emotion is well studied, indicators of emotion in sign language remain poorly understood, creating communication barriers in critical settings. Sign languages present unique challenges as facial expressions and hand movements simultaneously serve both grammatical and emotional functions. To address this gap, we introduce EmoSign, the first sign video dataset containing sentiment and emotion labels for 200 American Sign Language (ASL) videos. We also collect open-ended descriptions of emotion cues. Annotations were done by 3 Deaf ASL signers with professional interpretation experience. Alongside the annotations, we include baseline models for sentiment and emotion classification. This dataset not only addresses a critical gap in existing sign language research but also establishes a new benchmark for understanding model capabilities in multimodal emotion recognition for sign languages. The dataset is made available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/catfang/emosign.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) enables large vision-language models (LVLMs) to efficiently adapt to novel tasks, supporting a wide array of real-world applications. However, multimodal ICL remains unstable, and current research largely focuses on optimizing sequence configuration while overlooking the internal mechanisms of LVLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis of attentional dynamics in multimodal ICL and identify three core limitations of standard attention that ICL impair performance. To address these challenges, we propose Context-Aware Modulated Attention (CAMA), a simple yet effective plug-and-play method for directly calibrating LVLM attention logits. CAMA is training-free and can be seamlessly applied to various open-source LVLMs. We evaluate CAMA on four LVLMs across six benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and generality. CAMA opens new opportunities for deeper exploration and targeted utilization of LVLM attention dynamics to advance multimodal reasoning.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown success in tasks like visual question answering, but the reliance on memorized world knowledge versus visual information is uncertain. The Visual CounterFact dataset introduces visually-realistic counterfactuals that challenge world knowledge with visual input. Model predictions initially prioritize memorized priors but shift towards visual evidence in later layers, indicating a competition between the two modalities with visual input prevailing during evaluation. The Pixels Versus Priors (PvP) steering vectors offer a mechanism to control model outputs towards either world knowledge or visual input. PvP successfully shifts a high percentage of color and size predictions from priors to counterfactuals. These findings provide new insights and tools for interpreting and influencing the behavior of multimodal models.<br /><br />Summary: Multimodal Large Language Models balance memorized world knowledge and visual input in reasoning, with visual evidence dominating model predictions. The Visual CounterFact dataset and PvP steering vectors offer tools to understand and control the influence of world knowledge and visual information in these models. <div>
arXiv:2505.17127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on tasks such as visual question answering, but it remains unclear whether their reasoning relies more on memorized world knowledge or on the visual information present in the input image. To investigate this, we introduce Visual CounterFact, a new dataset of visually-realistic counterfactuals that put world knowledge priors (e.g, red strawberry) into direct conflict with visual input (e.g, blue strawberry). Using Visual CounterFact, we show that model predictions initially reflect memorized priors, but shift toward visual evidence in mid-to-late layers. This dynamic reveals a competition between the two modalities, with visual input ultimately overriding priors during evaluation. To control this behavior, we propose Pixels Versus Priors (PvP) steering vectors, a mechanism for controlling model outputs toward either world knowledge or visual input through activation-level interventions. On average, PvP successfully shifts 92.5% of color and 74.6% of size predictions from priors to counterfactuals. Together, these findings offer new tools for interpreting and controlling factual behavior in multimodal models.

<div> cache optimization, jailbreak attacks, multimodal models, defense mechanism, visual-textual interactions
Summary:
The paper introduces DTR, a defense mechanism for large vision-language models (VLMs) to protect against jailbreak attacks that exploit visual-textual interactions. DTR focuses on optimizing key-value caches at inference time rather than relying on specific safety data or image-to-text conversion. By dynamically adjusting visual token weights, DTR minimizes the impact of adversarial visual inputs while maintaining the model's general capabilities and efficiency. Extensive testing shows that DTR outperforms existing defenses in both attack robustness and task performance, making it the first successful application of cache optimization for enhancing safety in multimodal foundation models. The code for replicating DTR is available for further investigation. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit visual-textual interactions to bypass safety guardrails. In this paper, we present DTR, a novel inference-time defense that mitigates multimodal jailbreak attacks through optimizing the model's key-value (KV) caches. Rather than relying on curated safety-specific data or costly image-to-text conversion, we introduce a new formulation of the safety-relevant distributional shift induced by the visual modality. This formulation enables DTR to dynamically adjust visual token weights, minimizing the impact of adversarial visual inputs while preserving the model's general capabilities and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluation across diverse VLMs and attack benchmarks demonstrates that \sys outperforms existing defenses in both attack robustness and benign task performance, marking the first successful application of KV cache optimization for safety enhancement in multimodal foundation models. The code for replicating DTR is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DTR-2755 (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by VLMs.)

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in computer vision has made significant advancements, yet tracking small fish in underwater environments presents unique challenges due to complex 3D motions and data noise. Traditional single-view MOT models often fall short in these settings. This thesis addresses these challenges by adapting state-of-the-art single-view MOT models, FairMOT and YOLOv8, for underwater fish detecting and tracking in ecological studies. The core contribution of this research is the development of a multi-view framework that utilizes stereo video inputs to enhance tracking accuracy and fish behavior pattern recognition. By integrating and evaluating these models on underwater fish video datasets, the study aims to demonstrate significant improvements in precision and reliability compared to single-view approaches. The proposed framework detects fish entities with a relative accuracy of 47% and employs stereo-matching techniques to produce a novel 3D output, providing a more comprehensive understanding of fish movements and interactions

Abstract: In dyadic interactions, a broad spectrum of human facial reactions might be appropriate for responding to each human speaker behaviour. Following the successful organisation of the REACT 2023 and REACT 2024 challenges, we are proposing the REACT 2025 challenge encouraging the development and benchmarking of Machine Learning (ML) models that can be used to generate multiple appropriate, diverse, realistic and synchronised human-style facial reactions expressed by human listeners in response to an input stimulus (i.e., audio-visual behaviours expressed by their corresponding speakers). As a key of the challenge, we provide challenge participants with the first natural and large-scale multi-modal MAFRG dataset (called MARS) recording 137 human-human dyadic interactions containing a total of 2856 interaction sessions covering five different topics. In addition, this paper also presents the challenge guidelines and the performance of our baselines on the two proposed sub-challenges: Offline MAFRG and Online MAFRG, respectively.

Abstract: Charts play a critical role in data analysis and visualization, yet real-world applications often present charts with challenging or noisy features. However, "outlier charts" pose a substantial challenge even for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can struggle to interpret perturbed charts. In this work, we introduce CHAOS (CHart Analysis with Outlier Samples), a robustness benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs against chart perturbations. CHAOS encompasses five types of textual and ten types of visual perturbations, each presented at three levels of severity (easy, mid, hard) inspired by the study result of human evaluation. The benchmark includes 13 state-of-the-art MLLMs divided into three groups (i.e., general-, document-, and chart-specific models) according to the training scope and data. Comprehensive analysis involves two downstream tasks (ChartQA and Chart-to-Text). Extensive experiments and case studies highlight critical insights into robustness of models across chart perturbations, aiming to guide future research in chart understanding domain.

Dataset pruning for object detection is explored in this paper, aiming for efficient training data selection. Challenges in this extension include Object-Level Attribution, Scoring Strategy, and Image-Level Aggregation Problems. A novel scoring method, Variance-based Prediction Score (VPS), is introduced, utilizing IoU and confidence scores to identify informative training data for object detection tasks. Experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show improved mAP compared to existing pruning methods. The study highlights the impact of annotation count and class distribution shifts on detection performance, emphasizing the importance of selecting informative examples over dataset size or balance considerations. This work bridges the gap between dataset pruning and object detection, offering a promising approach for enhancing efficiency in complex vision tasks.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset pruning -- selecting a small yet informative subset of training data -- has emerged as a promising strategy for efficient machine learning, offering significant reductions in computational cost and storage compared to alternatives like dataset distillation. While pruning methods have shown strong performance in image classification, their extension to more complex computer vision tasks, particularly object detection, remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present the first principled extension of classification pruning techniques to the object detection domain, to the best of our knowledge. We identify and address three key challenges that hinder this transition: the Object-Level Attribution Problem, the Scoring Strategy Problem, and the Image-Level Aggregation Problem. To overcome these, we propose tailored solutions, including a novel scoring method called Variance-based Prediction Score (VPS). VPS leverages both Intersection over Union (IoU) and confidence scores to effectively identify informative training samples specific to detection tasks. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms prior dataset pruning methods in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP). We also show that annotation count and class distribution shift can influence detection performance, but selecting informative examples is a more critical factor than dataset size or balance. Our work bridges dataset pruning and object detection, paving the way for dataset pruning in complex vision tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-face generation, but achieving fine-grained control over facial features remains a challenge. Existing methods often require training additional modules to handle specific controls such as identity, attributes, or age, making them inflexible and resource-intensive. We propose ExpertGen, a training-free framework that leverages pre-trained expert models such as face recognition, facial attribute recognition, and age estimation networks to guide generation with fine control. Our approach uses a latent consistency model to ensure realistic and in-distribution predictions at each diffusion step, enabling accurate guidance signals to effectively steer the diffusion process. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that expert models can guide the generation process with high precision, and multiple experts can collaborate to enable simultaneous control over diverse facial aspects. By allowing direct integration of off-the-shelf expert models, our method transforms any such model into a plug-and-play component for controllable face generation.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on analyzing and quantifying bias interactions in text-to-image models, emphasizing the importance of understanding the interdependencies among different biases. The BiasConnect tool is introduced to reveal the underlying structure of bias interactions and estimate the effect of mitigating one bias axis on another. The InterMit algorithm is proposed for intersectional bias mitigation, achieving lower bias and superior image quality compared to traditional techniques. The algorithm allows users to define target distributions and priority weights, leading to more efficient bias mitigation with fewer steps. The study demonstrates strong correlation between the estimated effects of bias mitigation and observed outcomes, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach. The implementation is training-free, modular, and can be integrated with existing debiasing approaches, offering a flexible and extensible solution for addressing bias in text-to-image models. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biases exhibited by text-to-image (TTI) models are often treated as independent, though in reality, they may be deeply interrelated. Addressing bias along one dimension - such as ethnicity or age - can inadvertently affect another, like gender, either mitigating or exacerbating existing disparities. Understanding these interdependencies is crucial for designing fairer generative models, yet measuring such effects quantitatively remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce BiasConnect, a novel tool for analyzing and quantifying bias interactions in TTI models. BiasConnect uses counterfactual interventions along different bias axes to reveal the underlying structure of these interactions and estimates the effect of mitigating one bias axis on another. These estimates show strong correlation (+0.65) with observed post-mitigation outcomes. Building on BiasConnect, we propose InterMit, an intersectional bias mitigation algorithm guided by user-defined target distributions and priority weights. InterMit achieves lower bias (0.33 vs. 0.52) with fewer mitigation steps (2.38 vs. 3.15 average steps), and yields superior image quality compared to traditional techniques. Although our implementation is training-free, InterMit is modular and can be integrated with many existing debiasing approaches for TTI models, making it a flexible and extensible solution.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in medical imaging is crucial for identifying pathological abnormalities without requiring extensive labeled data. However, existing diffusion-based UAD models rely solely on imaging features, limiting their ability to distinguish between normal anatomical variations and pathological anomalies. To address this, we propose Diff3M, a multi-modal diffusion-based framework that integrates chest X-rays and structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for enhanced anomaly detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel image-EHR cross-attention module to incorporate structured clinical context into the image generation process, improving the model's ability to differentiate normal from abnormal features. Additionally, we develop a static masking strategy to enhance the reconstruction of normal-like images from anomalies. Extensive evaluations on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR/IV demonstrate that Diff3M achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing UAD methods in medical imaging.

<div> compressor, alignment, vision embeddings, large language models, multimodal models

Summary:
The study explores strategies to improve alignment between vision embeddings and Large Language Models (LLMs) in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). It investigates the role of projectors in compressing vision information and aligning it with word embeddings, demonstrating that projectors enhance compression while preserving key visual elements. The study introduces patch-level alignment and proposes a multi-semantic alignment hypothesis to enhance understanding between vision patches and semantic words. It finds that current projectors achieve limited patch-level alignment, leading to coarse alignment. To address this, the study introduces patch-aligned training, which significantly improves compression and patch-level alignment, leading to higher-quality captions. The proposed method shows a performance increase of 16% on referring expression grounding, 4% on question-answering, and 3% on instruction-following tasks under supervised fine-tuning settings. The approach is applicable to other multimodal models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving better alignment between vision embeddings and Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing the abilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly for recent models that rely on powerful pretrained vision encoders and LLMs. A common approach to connect the pretrained vision encoder and LLM is through a projector applied after the vision encoder. However, the projector is often trained to enable the LLM to generate captions, and hence the mechanism by which LLMs understand each vision token remains unclear. In this work, we first investigate the role of the projector in compressing vision embeddings and aligning them with word embeddings. We show that the projector significantly compresses visual information, removing redundant details while preserving essential elements necessary for the LLM to understand visual content. We then examine patch-level alignment -- the alignment between each vision patch and its corresponding semantic words -- and propose a *multi-semantic alignment hypothesis*. Our analysis indicates that the projector trained by caption loss improves patch-level alignment but only to a limited extent, resulting in weak and coarse alignment. To address this issue, we propose *patch-aligned training* to efficiently enhance patch-level alignment. Our experiments show that patch-aligned training (1) achieves stronger compression capability and improved patch-level alignment, enabling the MLLM to generate higher-quality captions, (2) improves the MLLM's performance by 16% on referring expression grounding tasks, 4% on question-answering tasks, and 3% on modern instruction-following benchmarks when using the same supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. The proposed method can be easily extended to other multimodal models.

Abstract: Biological collections house millions of specimens documenting Earth's biodiversity, with digital images increasingly available through open-access platforms. Most imaging protocols were developed for human visual interpretation without considering computational analysis requirements. This paper aims to bridge the gap between current imaging practices and the potential for automated analysis by presenting key considerations for creating biological specimen images optimized for computer vision applications. We provide conceptual computer vision topics for context, addressing fundamental concerns including model generalization, data leakage, and comprehensive metadata documentation, and outline practical guidance on specimen imagine, and data storage. These recommendations were synthesized through interdisciplinary collaboration between taxonomists, collection managers, ecologists, and computer scientists. Through this synthesis, we have identified ten interconnected considerations that form a framework for successfully integrating biological specimen images into computer vision pipelines. The key elements include: (1) comprehensive metadata documentation, (2) standardized specimen positioning, (3) consistent size and color calibration, (4) protocols for handling multiple specimens in one image, (5) uniform background selection, (6) controlled lighting, (7) appropriate resolution and magnification, (8) optimal file formats, (9) robust data archiving strategies, and (10) accessible data sharing practices. By implementing these recommendations, collection managers, taxonomists, and biodiversity informaticians can generate images that support automated trait extraction, species identification, and novel ecological and evolutionary analyses at unprecedented scales. Successful implementation lies in thorough documentation of methodological choices.

Summary:
The article introduces a method that combines contrastive learning and domain-adversarial training to learn game-invariant visual features, addressing the issue of overfitting to game-specific visual styles in foundational game-image encoders. By encouraging content to cluster while discouraging game-specific cues, the approach produces embeddings that generalize across diverse games. Experiments on the Bingsu game-image dataset show that the model's features no longer cluster by game after a few training epochs, indicating successful invariance and potential for improved cross-game transfer, such as glitch detection, with minimal fine-tuning. This advancement opens the door for more generalizable game vision models that require little or no retraining on new games.

Abstract: Foundational game-image encoders often overfit to game-specific visual styles, undermining performance on downstream tasks when applied to new games. We present a method that combines contrastive learning and domain-adversarial training to learn game-invariant visual features. By simultaneously encouraging similar content to cluster and discouraging game-specific cues via an adversarial domain classifier, our approach produces embeddings that generalize across diverse games. Experiments on the Bingsu game-image dataset (10,000 screenshots from 10 games) demonstrate that after only a few training epochs, our model's features no longer cluster by game, indicating successful invariance and potential for improved cross-game transfer (e.g., glitch detection) with minimal fine-tuning. This capability paves the way for more generalizable game vision models that require little to no retraining on new games.

<div> Keywords: temporal modeling, respiratory motion, image-to-video synthesis, temporal differential diffusion model, attention layer

Summary:
Temporal modeling on regular respiratory-induced motions is essential for image-guided clinical applications. Existing methods face challenges in simulating temporal motions due to dynamic backgrounds caused by slight patient movements. In this study, a novel approach utilizing image-to-video synthesis is introduced to forecast future frames based on the initial frame, enabling simulation of regular motion processes. To improve temporal consistency, a Temporal Differential Diffusion Model is proposed to generate temporal differential fields, measuring relative differential representations between frames. A prompt attention layer and field augmented layer further enhance the interaction of differential fields with the image-to-video framework, resulting in more accurate temporal variation in synthesized videos. Experimental results on ACDC cardiac and 4D Lung datasets demonstrate that the approach effectively simulates 4D videos along intrinsic motion trajectories, achieving competitive performance in perceptual similarity and temporal consistency. <div>

Abstract: Temporal modeling on regular respiration-induced motions is crucial to image-guided clinical applications. Existing methods cannot simulate temporal motions unless high-dose imaging scans including starting and ending frames exist simultaneously. However, in the preoperative data acquisition stage, the slight movement of patients may result in dynamic backgrounds between the first and last frames in a respiratory period. This additional deviation can hardly be removed by image registration, thus affecting the temporal modeling. To address that limitation, we pioneeringly simulate the regular motion process via the image-to-video (I2V) synthesis framework, which animates with the first frame to forecast future frames of a given length. Besides, to promote the temporal consistency of animated videos, we devise the Temporal Differential Diffusion Model to generate temporal differential fields, which measure the relative differential representations between adjacent frames. The prompt attention layer is devised for fine-grained differential fields, and the field augmented layer is adopted to better interact these fields with the I2V framework, promoting more accurate temporal variation of synthesized videos. Extensive results on ACDC cardiac and 4D Lung datasets reveal that our approach simulates 4D videos along the intrinsic motion trajectory, rivaling other competitive methods on perceptual similarity and temporal consistency. Codes will be available soon.

Render-FM employs an encoder-decoder architecture that directly regresses 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS) parameters from CT volumes, eliminating per-scan optimization through large-scale pre-training on diverse medical data. By integrating robust feature extraction with the expressive power of 6DGS, our approach efficiently generates high-quality, real-time interactive 3D visualizations across diverse clinical CT data. Experiments demonstrate that Render-FM achieves visual fidelity comparable or superior to specialized per-scan methods while drastically reducing preparation time from nearly an hour to seconds for a single inference step. This advancement enables seamless integration into real-time surgical planning and diagnostic workflows. The project page is: https://gaozhongpai.github.io/renderfm/.

Summary: 
This paper explores the fusion of eye movements and periocular images for authentication, creating a calibration-free system. The study evaluates a multimodal authentication approach using a large dataset of 9202 subjects with eye tracking signal quality similar to VR devices. Results demonstrate that the multimodal system consistently outperforms unimodal systems and exceeds the FIDO benchmark. Integration of a machine learning architecture enhances authentication performance by capturing representations and leveraging the distinct discriminative features of the combined modalities. The study highlights the potential of combining eye-centric modalities for robust and scalable user authentication. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of fusing two eye-centric authentication modalities-eye movements and periocular images-within a calibration-free authentication system. While each modality has independently shown promise for user authentication, their combination within a unified gaze-estimation pipeline has not been thoroughly explored at scale. In this report, we propose a multimodal authentication system and evaluate it using a large-scale in-house dataset comprising 9202 subjects with an eye tracking (ET) signal quality equivalent to a consumer-facing virtual reality (VR) device. Our results show that the multimodal approach consistently outperforms both unimodal systems across all scenarios, surpassing the FIDO benchmark. The integration of a state-of-the-art machine learning architecture contributed significantly to the overall authentication performance at scale, driven by the model's ability to capture authentication representations and the complementary discriminative characteristics of the fused modalities.

Summary:<br /><br />Diffusion models are powerful generative models for images, but aligning their outputs with human preferences and safety constraints remains a critical challenge. This thesis proposal investigates methods to align diffusion models using reinforcement learning and reward modeling. It surveys recent advances in fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models with human feedback, classifies methods based on feedback type and fine-tuning technique, and compares algorithms and frameworks for improved alignment with user intent and safety standards. Five promising research directions for the next two years are identified: multi-objective alignment, efficient human feedback usage, robust safety alignment, continual alignment of diffusion models, and interpretable reward modeling. Each direction is elaborated with its problem statement, challenges, related work, and a proposed research plan. This proposal aims to contribute new insights and techniques for safer and value-aligned generative AI based on diffusion models.

Summary: 
This article introduces a new approach for solving ill-posed inverse problems utilizing diffusion model priors. Traditional methods like MAP or posterior sampling often result in inaccurate samples due to computational approximations. The proposed dual ascent optimization framework offers improved image quality metrics, robustness against high noise levels, faster computation, and more faithful representation of observations. By addressing these challenges, the framework enhances image restoration tasks and outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Ill-posed inverse problems are fundamental in many domains, ranging from astrophysics to medical imaging. Emerging diffusion models provide a powerful prior for solving these problems. Existing maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) or posterior sampling approaches, however, rely on different computational approximations, leading to inaccurate or suboptimal samples. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach to solving MAP problems with diffusion model priors using a dual ascent optimization framework. Our framework achieves better image quality as measured by various metrics for image restoration problems, it is more robust to high levels of measurement noise, it is faster, and it estimates solutions that represent the observations more faithfully than the state of the art.

Summary: 
This study introduces a method to improve monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) models' performance on out-of-distribution datasets by incorporating defocus blur cues at inference time into a pre-trained diffusion model called Marigold. By capturing images with different aperture sizes and optimizing the model's parameters using a defocus-blur image formation model, the method effectively transforms Marigold into a metric depth predictor without additional training. Experimental results on a real dataset demonstrate quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing zero-shot MMDE methods, showcasing the efficacy of the proposed approach in enhancing depth estimation accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2505.17358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) methods have made notable progress towards zero-shot generalization. However, they still exhibit a significant performance drop on out-of-distribution datasets. We address this limitation by injecting defocus blur cues at inference time into Marigold, a \textit{pre-trained} diffusion model for zero-shot, scale-invariant monocular depth estimation (MDE). Our method effectively turns Marigold into a metric depth predictor in a training-free manner. To incorporate defocus cues, we capture two images with a small and a large aperture from the same viewpoint. To recover metric depth, we then optimize the metric depth scaling parameters and the noise latents of Marigold at inference time using gradients from a loss function based on the defocus-blur image formation model. We compare our method against existing state-of-the-art zero-shot MMDE methods on a self-collected real dataset, showing quantitative and qualitative improvements.

Summary:
Vision Transformers (ViTs) are utilized in this study to improve early wildfire detection, crucial due to the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in the US, particularly in California. Challenges in wildfire detection include limited real-time data availability, smoke and cloud cover interference, and computational expenses associated with training deep learning models. The study focuses on a dataset of high-resolution images categorized into 'fire' and 'nofire' classes, which are preprocessed for training the ViT model. The data preparation involves resizing images, converting them into tensors, and normalizing using ImageNet statistics. Effective detection and prevention strategies are urgently needed in light of devastating wildfires, such as the Los Angeles fires of January 2025 that led to significant property damage and loss of life. Integration of detection systems with real-time alert mechanisms remains a complex issue in enhancing early wildfire detection capabilities.

Abstract: The critical need for sophisticated detection techniques has been highlighted by the rising frequency and intensity of wildfires in the US, especially in California. In 2023, wildfires caused 130 deaths nationwide, the highest since 1990. In January 2025, Los Angeles wildfires which included the Palisades and Eaton fires burnt approximately 40,000 acres and 12,000 buildings, and caused loss of human lives. The devastation underscores the urgent need for effective detection and prevention strategies. Deep learning models, such as Vision Transformers (ViTs), can enhance early detection by processing complex image data with high accuracy. However, wildfire detection faces challenges, including the availability of high-quality, real-time data. Wildfires often occur in remote areas with limited sensor coverage, and environmental factors like smoke and cloud cover can hinder detection. Additionally, training deep learning models is computationally expensive, and issues like false positives/negatives and scaling remain concerns. Integrating detection systems with real-time alert mechanisms also poses difficulties. In this work, we used the wildfire dataset consisting of 10.74 GB high-resolution images categorized into 'fire' and 'nofire' classes is used for training the ViT model. To prepare the data, images are resized to 224 x 224 pixels, converted into tensor format, and normalized using ImageNet statistics.

Abstract: Generating high resolution 3D shapes using volumetric representations such as Signed Distance Functions presents substantial computational and memory challenges. We introduce Direct3D S2, a scalable 3D generation framework based on sparse volumes that achieves superior output quality with dramatically reduced training costs. Our key innovation is the Spatial Sparse Attention mechanism, which greatly enhances the efficiency of Diffusion Transformer computations on sparse volumetric data.

Our model is trained on public available datasets, and experiments demonstrate that Direct3D S2 not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generation quality and efficiency, but also enables training at 1024 resolution using only 8 GPUs, a task typically requiring at least 32 GPUs for volumetric representations at 256 resolution, thus making gigascale 3D generation both practical and accessible.

Summary: 
The article presents a new method called Video-to-text Information Bottleneck Evaluation (VIBE) to evaluate outputs of vision-language models for decision-making tasks that require human supervision. VIBE scores VLM summaries based on grounding (alignment with visual content) and utility (informativeness for the task). This annotation-free approach selects the most relevant VLM outputs to enhance task performance. Human studies on various datasets demonstrate that VIBE-selected summaries significantly improve accuracy by up to 61.23% and reduce response time by 75.77% compared to raw videos or naive VLM summaries. VIBE addresses the shortcomings of current video caption evaluation methods and provides a more efficient and effective solution for tasks where accuracy and cognitive load reduction are crucial.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24, SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.

Summary:
The article introduces the Locate-Then-Correct (LTC) framework to address spurious associations in multimodal models like CLIP. LTC identifies and mitigates spurious attention heads in Vision Transformers through targeted ablation, improving classification performance by integrating discriminative features. It also identifies salient attention heads for better task performance. When evaluated on biased benchmarks, LTC achieves significant gains in worst-group accuracy compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Multimodal models like CLIP have gained significant attention due to their remarkable zero-shot performance across various tasks. However, studies have revealed that CLIP can inadvertently learn spurious associations between target variables and confounding factors. To address this, we introduce \textsc{Locate-Then-Correct} (LTC), a contrastive framework that identifies spurious attention heads in Vision Transformers via mechanistic insights and mitigates them through targeted ablation. Furthermore, LTC identifies salient, task-relevant attention heads, enabling the integration of discriminative features through orthogonal projection to improve classification performance. We evaluate LTC on benchmarks with inherent background and gender biases, achieving over a $>50\%$ gain in worst-group accuracy compared to non-training post-hoc baselines. Additionally, we visualize the representation of selected heads and find that the presented interpretation corroborates our contrastive mechanism for identifying both spurious and salient attention heads.

OmniTraj integrates four modalities -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system, enabling accurate and flexible queries. Unlike traditional methods, OmniTraj uses dedicated encoders for each modality, creating a shared representation space.

Experimental results on real-world data highlight OmniTraj's effectiveness in handling large datasets, providing multi-modality queries, and supporting various applications. Overall, OmniTraj enhances trajectory retrieval performance in mobile data environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile devices and data collection technologies has led to an exponential increase in trajectory data, presenting significant challenges in spatio-temporal data mining, particularly for efficient and accurate trajectory retrieval. However, existing methods for trajectory retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of traditional similarity-based methods.

<div> Keywords: Large Vision-Language Models, adversarial attacks, Vision Encoder Attack, image tokens, performance degradation.<br />
<br />
Summary: The study introduces a Vision Encoder Attack (VEAttack) targeting the vision encoder in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. By minimizing the cosine similarity between clean and perturbed visual features, VEAttack significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining effectiveness across various tasks without the need for task-specific information or labels. Perturbing image tokens instead of classification tokens proves to be a successful strategy for generating adversarial examples in LVLMs. The attack demonstrates a performance degradation of 94.5% in image caption tasks and 75.7% in visual question answering tasks. Key observations include variations in hidden layers, token attention differentials, transfer attacks via M\"obius band, and low sensitivity to attack steps. The open-source code for VEAttack in LVLMs is available for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises significant robustness concerns. While existing effective attacks always focus on task-specific white-box settings, these approaches are limited in the context of LVLMs, which are designed for diverse downstream tasks and require expensive full-model gradient computations. Motivated by the pivotal role and wide adoption of the vision encoder in LVLMs, we propose a simple yet effective Vision Encoder Attack (VEAttack), which targets the vision encoder of LVLMs only. Specifically, we propose to generate adversarial examples by minimizing the cosine similarity between the clean and perturbed visual features, without accessing the following large language models, task information, and labels. It significantly reduces the computational overhead while eliminating the task and label dependence of traditional white-box attacks in LVLMs. To make this simple attack effective, we propose to perturb images by optimizing image tokens instead of the classification token. We provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that VEAttack can easily generalize to various tasks. VEAttack has achieved a performance degradation of 94.5% on image caption task and 75.7% on visual question answering task. We also reveal some key observations to provide insights into LVLM attack/defense: 1) hidden layer variations of LLM, 2) token attention differential, 3) M\"obius band in transfer attack, 4) low sensitivity to attack steps.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new framework for low-bitrate transmission in intelligent transportation systems, focusing on collaborative perception among vehicles with limited bandwidth. The proposed framework, called Reflectance Prediction-based Knowledge Distillation (RPKD), addresses issues related to existing compression transmission systems by compressing point coordinates without reflectance during transmission. A 3D object detection framework with a RBKD module reconstructs the discarded reflectance for precise detection. The framework includes teacher and student detectors for reflectance and detection knowledge distillation, improving detection accuracy for compressed point clouds at different code rates. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset and Waymo Open Dataset show that the RPKD framework achieves the highest mAP of 73.6 at a low code rate of 2.146 Bpp on the KITTI dataset, outperforming existing detection methods. <div>

Abstract: Regarding intelligent transportation systems for vehicle networking, low-bitrate transmission via lossy point cloud compression is vital for facilitating real-time collaborative perception among vehicles with restricted bandwidth. In existing compression transmission systems, the sender lossily compresses point coordinates and reflectance to generate a transmission code stream, which faces transmission burdens from reflectance encoding and limited detection robustness due to information loss. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 3D object detection framework with reflectance prediction-based knowledge distillation (RPKD). We compress point coordinates while discarding reflectance during low-bitrate transmission, and feed the decoded non-reflectance compressed point clouds into a student detector. The discarded reflectance is then reconstructed by a geometry-based reflectance prediction (RP) module within the student detector for precise detection. A teacher detector with the same structure as student detector is designed for performing reflectance knowledge distillation (RKD) and detection knowledge distillation (DKD) from raw to compressed point clouds. Our RPKD framework jointly trains detectors on both raw and compressed point clouds to improve the student detector's robustness. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method can boost detection accuracy for compressed point clouds across multiple code rates. Notably, at a low code rate of 2.146 Bpp on the KITTI dataset, our RPKD-PV achieves the highest mAP of 73.6, outperforming existing detection methods with the PV-RCNN baseline.

Summary:
The article discusses the increasing trend of pet ownership in the United States and the challenges related to pet identification and monitoring. Traditional methods like GPS tags or ID photos have limitations, leading to the introduction of PawPrint and PawPrint+ datasets focusing on individual-level footprint identification for dogs and cats. The study compares modern deep neural networks and classical local features for this purpose, highlighting varying advantages and drawbacks based on substrate complexity and data availability. The findings suggest potential directions for combining global representations with local descriptors to improve reliability in real-world conditions. This non-invasive alternative to traditional ID tags could have promising applications in ethical pet management and wildlife conservation efforts. <div>

Abstract: In the United States, as of 2023, pet ownership has reached 66% of households and continues to rise annually. This trend underscores the critical need for effective pet identification and monitoring methods, particularly as nearly 10 million cats and dogs are reported stolen or lost each year. However, traditional methods for finding lost animals like GPS tags or ID photos have limitations-they can be removed, face signal issues, and depend on someone finding and reporting the pet. To address these limitations, we introduce PawPrint and PawPrint+, the first publicly available datasets focused on individual-level footprint identification for dogs and cats. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both modern deep neural networks (e.g., CNN, Transformers) and classical local features, we observe varying advantages and drawbacks depending on substrate complexity and data availability. These insights suggest future directions for combining learned global representations with local descriptors to enhance reliability across diverse, real-world conditions. As this approach provides a non-invasive alternative to traditional ID tags, we anticipate promising applications in ethical pet management and wildlife conservation efforts.

Summary:
This paper introduces a lightweight framework, RARE, for real-time anticipation of traffic accidents in autonomous driving. RARE utilizes intermediate features from a single pre-trained object detector to reduce computational complexity and latency. The framework incorporates a novel Attention Score Ranking Loss, which enhances accuracy by prioritizing accident-related objects. RARE achieves a significant speedup compared to existing methods on benchmark datasets, with a latency of 13.6ms per frame on an RTX 6000 GPU. Despite its simplified design, RARE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of Average Precision and effectively anticipates impending collisions in real time. The results demonstrate RARE's potential for use in safety-critical applications where timely and interpretable accident anticipation is crucial.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of anticipating traffic accidents, which aims to forecast potential accidents before they happen. Real-time anticipation is crucial for safe autonomous driving, yet most methods rely on computationally heavy modules like optical flow and intermediate feature extractors, making real-world deployment challenging. In this paper, we thus introduce RARE (Real-time Accident anticipation with Reused Embeddings), a lightweight framework that capitalizes on intermediate features from a single pre-trained object detector. By eliminating additional feature-extraction pipelines, RARE significantly reduces latency. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Attention Score Ranking Loss, which prioritizes higher attention on accident-related objects over non-relevant ones. This loss enhances both accuracy and interpretability. RARE demonstrates a 4-8 times speedup over existing approaches on the DAD and CCD benchmarks, achieving a latency of 13.6ms per frame (73.3 FPS) on an RTX 6000. Moreover, despite its reduced complexity, it attains state-of-the-art Average Precision and reliably anticipates imminent collisions in real time. These results highlight RARE's potential for safety-critical applications where timely and explainable anticipation is essential.

Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology present a significant challenge for large-scale medical image analysis due to their high resolution, large size, and complex tile relationships. Existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based models, face limitations in scalability and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose the WSI-GMamba framework, which synergistically combines the relational modeling strengths of GNNs with the efficiency of Mamba, the State Space Model designed for sequence learning. The proposed GMamba block integrates Message Passing, Graph Scanning & Flattening, and feature aggregation via a Bidirectional State Space Model (Bi-SSM), achieving Transformer-level performance with 7* fewer FLOPs. By leveraging the complementary strengths of lightweight GNNs and Mamba, the WSI-GMamba framework delivers a scalable solution for large-scale WSI analysis, offering both high accuracy and computational efficiency for slide-level classification.

Summary:
Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are being used in various multimodal applications requiring complex visual and linguistic reasoning. This study examines LVLMs' capability to handle individual variations in color perception, specifically related to Color Vision Deficiencies (CVDs). Results show that LVLMs can explain CVDs in natural language but struggle to simulate how individuals with CVDs perceive color in image-based tasks. This highlights the importance of developing multimodal systems that can accommodate color perceptual diversity. Addressing perceptual inclusiveness and fairness in multimodal AI is crucial for ensuring equitable use of these technologies. <div>

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly being applied to a wide range of real-world multimodal applications, involving complex visual and linguistic reasoning. As these models become more integrated into practical use, they are expected to handle complex aspects of human interaction. Among these, color perception is a fundamental yet highly variable aspect of visual understanding. It differs across individuals due to biological factors such as Color Vision Deficiencies (CVDs), as well as differences in culture and language. Despite its importance, perceptual diversity has received limited attention. In our study, we evaluate LVLMs' ability to account for individual level perceptual variation using the Ishihara Test, a widely used method for detecting CVDs. Our results show that LVLMs can explain CVDs in natural language, but they cannot simulate how people with CVDs perceive color in image based tasks. These findings highlight the need for multimodal systems that can account for color perceptual diversity and support broader discussions on perceptual inclusiveness and fairness in multimodal AI.

Abstract: Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements, including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce OrionBench, a benchmark designed to support the development of accurate object detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 26,250 real and 78,750 synthetic infographics, with over 6.9 million bounding box annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of OrionBench through three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI element detection.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on multi-dataset training (MDT) for pose estimation, addressing the challenge of skeletal heterogeneity. A new framework called PoseBH is introduced, which utilizes nonparametric keypoint prototypes to learn within a unified embedding space for seamless integration across skeleton types. It also incorporates a cross-type self-supervision mechanism aligning keypoint predictions with prototypes for enhanced supervision without teacher-student models. PoseBH significantly improves generalization across various pose datasets, including whole-body and animal poses, while maintaining performance on standard human pose benchmarks. Moreover, the learned keypoint embeddings show effective transferability to hand shape and human body shape estimation tasks. The code for PoseBH is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2505.17475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multi-dataset training (MDT) for pose estimation, where skeletal heterogeneity presents a unique challenge that existing methods have yet to address. In traditional domains, \eg regression and classification, MDT typically relies on dataset merging or multi-head supervision. However, the diversity of skeleton types and limited cross-dataset supervision complicate integration in pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce PoseBH, a new MDT framework that tackles keypoint heterogeneity and limited supervision through two key techniques. First, we propose nonparametric keypoint prototypes that learn within a unified embedding space, enabling seamless integration across skeleton types. Second, we develop a cross-type self-supervision mechanism that aligns keypoint predictions with keypoint embedding prototypes, providing supervision without relying on teacher-student models or additional augmentations. PoseBH substantially improves generalization across whole-body and animal pose datasets, including COCO-WholeBody, AP-10K, and APT-36K, while preserving performance on standard human pose benchmarks (COCO, MPII, and AIC). Furthermore, our learned keypoint embeddings transfer effectively to hand shape estimation (InterHand2.6M) and human body shape estimation (3DPW). The code for PoseBH is available at: https://github.com/uyoung-jeong/PoseBH.

Summary: 
This study addresses the challenges in detecting and grounding multimedia manipulation, particularly focusing on the limitations in current approaches. The research identifies the underestimation of deception risk posed by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can generate sophisticated and contextually plausible misinformation. Additionally, existing methods often rely on unrealistic misalignment artifacts that make the manipulation easily detectable. To overcome these limitations, the proposed adversarial pipeline leverages MLLMs to generate high-risk disinformation. The approach involves constructing a Synthetic Multimodal dataset where images are altered and paired with MLLM-generated deceptive texts. The framework, called AMD, features innovative strategies to detect MLLM-powered multimodal deceptions, enhancing generalization capabilities for manipulation diagnosis. <div>

Abstract: The detection and grounding of multimedia manipulation has emerged as a critical challenge in combating AI-generated disinformation. While existing methods have made progress in recent years, we identify two fundamental limitations in current approaches: (1) Underestimation of MLLM-driven deception risk: prevailing techniques primarily address rule-based text manipulations, yet fail to account for sophisticated misinformation synthesized by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can dynamically generate semantically coherent, contextually plausible yet deceptive narratives conditioned on manipulated images; (2) Unrealistic misalignment artifacts: currently focused scenarios rely on artificially misaligned content that lacks semantic coherence, rendering them easily detectable. To address these gaps holistically, we propose a new adversarial pipeline that leverages MLLMs to generate high-risk disinformation. Our approach begins with constructing the MLLM-Driven Synthetic Multimodal (MDSM) dataset, where images are first altered using state-of-the-art editing techniques and then paired with MLLM-generated deceptive texts that maintain semantic consistency with the visual manipulations. Building upon this foundation, we present the Artifact-aware Manipulation Diagnosis via MLLM (AMD) framework featuring two key innovations: Artifact Pre-perception Encoding strategy and Manipulation-Oriented Reasoning, to tame MLLMs for the MDSM problem. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's superior generalization capabilities as a unified architecture for detecting MLLM-powered multimodal deceptions.

Abstract: The motor control board has various defects such as inconsistent color differences, incorrect plug-in positions, solder short circuits, and more. These defects directly affect the performance and stability of the motor control board, thereby having a negative impact on product quality. Therefore, studying the defect detection technology of the motor control board is an important means to improve the quality control level of the motor control board.

Thirdly, the search algorithm for defective images was optimized. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted on the typical motor control board, and the experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of the motor control board defect detection model-based on image processing established in this paper reached over 99%. It is suitable for timely image processing of large quantities of motor control boards on the production line, and achieved efficient defect detection. The defect detection method can not only be used for online detection of the motor control board defects, but also provide solutions for the integrated circuit board defect processing for the industry.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel framework called Robust Hybrid Diffusion Recovery (RoHyDR) to address the challenges of Incomplete Multimodal Emotion Recognition (IMER) caused by missing or corrupted data. RoHyDR performs missing-modality recovery at various levels including unimodal, multimodal, feature, and semantic levels. It uses a diffusion-based generator for unimodal representation recovery and adversarial learning for multimodal fusion recovery, enabling realistic fused multimodal representation and semantic content recovery. The framework also includes a multi-stage optimization strategy to enhance training stability and efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on two multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks, RoHyDR outperforms existing IMER methods by effectively recovering missing information at different levels and achieving robust recognition performance under various missing-modality scenarios. The code for RoHyDR will be publicly available upon acceptance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition analyzes emotions by combining data from multiple sources. However, real-world noise or sensor failures often cause missing or corrupted data, creating the Incomplete Multimodal Emotion Recognition (IMER) challenge. In this paper, we propose Robust Hybrid Diffusion Recovery (RoHyDR), a novel framework that performs missing-modality recovery at unimodal, multimodal, feature, and semantic levels. For unimodal representation recovery of missing modalities, RoHyDR exploits a diffusion-based generator to generate distribution-consistent and semantically aligned representations from Gaussian noise, using available modalities as conditioning. For multimodal fusion recovery, we introduce adversarial learning to produce a realistic fused multimodal representation and recover missing semantic content. We further propose a multi-stage optimization strategy that enhances training stability and efficiency. In contrast to previous work, the hybrid diffusion and adversarial learning-based recovery mechanism in RoHyDR allows recovery of missing information in both unimodal representation and multimodal fusion, at both feature and semantic levels, effectively mitigating performance degradation caused by suboptimal optimization. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two widely used multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art IMER methods, achieving robust recognition performance under various missing-modality scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) have excellent generalization capabilities but are highly susceptible to adversarial examples, presenting potential security risks. To improve the robustness of VLMs against adversarial examples, adversarial prompt tuning methods are proposed to align the text feature with the adversarial image feature without changing model parameters. However, when facing various adversarial attacks, a single learnable text prompt has insufficient generalization to align well with all adversarial image features, which finally leads to the overfitting phenomenon. To address the above challenge, in this paper, we empirically find that increasing the number of learned prompts can bring more robustness improvement than a longer prompt. Then we propose an adversarial tuning method named Adversarial Mixture Prompt Tuning (AMPT) to enhance the generalization towards various adversarial attacks for VLMs. AMPT aims to learn mixture text prompts to obtain more robust text features. To further enhance the adaptability, we propose a conditional weight router based on the input adversarial image to predict the mixture weights of multiple learned prompts, which helps obtain sample-specific aggregated text features aligning with different adversarial image features. A series of experiments show that our method can achieve better adversarial robustness than state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets under different experimental settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly expanded their utility in tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. However, they still struggle with object hallucination, where models generate descriptions that inaccurately reflect the visual content by including nonexistent objects or misrepresenting existing ones. While previous methods, such as data augmentation and training-free approaches, strive to tackle this issue, they still encounter scalability challenges and often depend on additional external modules. In this work, we propose Ensemble Decoding (ED), a novel strategy that splits the input image into sub-images and combines logit distributions by assigning weights through the attention map. Furthermore, we introduce ED adaptive plausibility constraint to calibrate logit distribution and FastED, a variant designed for speed-critical applications. Extensive experiments across hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: This paper presents a pioneering exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) via group relative policy optimization for unified multimodal large language models (ULMs), aimed at simultaneously reinforcing generation and understanding capabilities. Through systematic pilot studies, we uncover the significant potential of ULMs to enable the synergistic co-evolution of dual capabilities within a shared policy optimization framework. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{CoRL}, a co-reinforcement learning framework comprising a unified RL stage for joint optimization and a refined RL stage for task-specific enhancement. With the proposed CoRL, our resulting model, \textbf{ULM-R1}, achieves average improvements of \textbf{7%} on three text-to-image generation datasets and \textbf{23%} on nine multimodal understanding benchmarks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRL and highlight the substantial benefit of reinforcement learning in facilitating cross-task synergy and optimization for ULMs.

<div> Keywords: text-to-image generation, prompt enhancement, reinforcement learning, structured prompts, compositional generalization

Summary:
RePrompt introduces a novel framework for improving text-to-image (T2I) generation by incorporating explicit reasoning into prompt enhancement using reinforcement learning. Unlike previous methods that often generate stylistic or unrealistic content, RePrompt trains a language model to generate structured prompts that optimize for image-level outcomes. The method utilizes tailored reward models to assess generated images based on human preference, semantic alignment, and visual composition, allowing for end-to-end training without human-annotated data. Experimental results on GenEval and T2I-Compbench datasets demonstrate that RePrompt significantly improves spatial layout fidelity and compositional generalization across various T2I models, achieving state-of-the-art results. <div>

Abstract: Despite recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation, existing models often struggle to faithfully capture user intentions from short and under-specified prompts. While prior work has attempted to enhance prompts using large language models (LLMs), these methods frequently generate stylistic or unrealistic content due to insufficient grounding in visual semantics and real-world composition. Inspired by recent advances in reasoning for language model, we propose RePrompt, a novel reprompting framework that introduces explicit reasoning into the prompt enhancement process via reinforcement learning. Instead of relying on handcrafted rules or stylistic rewrites, our method trains a language model to generate structured, self-reflective prompts by optimizing for image-level outcomes. The tailored reward models assesse the generated images in terms of human preference, semantic alignment, and visual composition, providing indirect supervision to refine prompt generation. Our approach enables end-to-end training without human-annotated data. Experiments on GenEval and T2I-Compbench show that RePrompt significantly boosts spatial layout fidelity and compositional generalization across diverse T2I backbones, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

Summary:<br />
Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have improved video quality but raised concerns about potential misuse. To address this, the study introduces an unlearning method for text-to-video models inspired by successful techniques in text-to-image models. By incorporating negatively-guided velocity prediction fine-tuning and prompt augmentation, the proposed method ensures robustness against refined prompts. Localization and preservation regularization are utilized for precise unlearning to erase specific concepts while maintaining the model's ability to generate other concepts.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have significantly enhanced the quality of generated videos. However, their ability to produce explicit or harmful content raises concerns about misuse and potential rights violations. Inspired by the success of unlearning techniques in erasing undesirable concepts from text-to-image (T2I) models, we extend unlearning to T2V models and propose a robust and precise unlearning method. Specifically, we adopt negatively-guided velocity prediction fine-tuning and enhance it with prompt augmentation to ensure robustness against LLM-refined prompts. To achieve precise unlearning, we incorporate a localization and a preservation regularization to preserve the model's ability to generate non-target concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively erases a specific concept while preserving the model's generation capability for all other concepts, outperforming existing methods. We provide the unlearned models in \href{https://github.com/VDIGPKU/T2VUnlearning.git}{https://github.com/VDIGPKU/T2VUnlearning.git}.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel Center-aware Residual Anomaly Synthesis (CRAS) method for multi-class anomaly detection in industrial images. The existing methods for anomaly detection often require separate models for each category, resulting in increased deployment costs. The CRAS method addresses this challenge by utilizing center-aware residual learning to combine samples from different categories into a unified center, reducing inter-class interference. Additionally, CRAS introduces distance-guided anomaly synthesis to adjust noise variance based on the distribution of normal data, thereby reducing intra-class overlap. Experimental results show that CRAS achieves superior detection accuracy and competitive inference speed on various datasets and real-world industrial applications. The source code and dataset are publicly available for further research and development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in the inspection of industrial images. Most existing methods require separate models for each category, resulting in multiplied deployment costs. This highlights the challenge of developing a unified model for multi-class anomaly detection. However, the significant increase in inter-class interference leads to severe missed detections. Furthermore, the intra-class overlap between normal and abnormal samples, particularly in synthesis-based methods, cannot be ignored and may lead to over-detection. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Center-aware Residual Anomaly Synthesis (CRAS) method for multi-class anomaly detection. CRAS leverages center-aware residual learning to couple samples from different categories into a unified center, mitigating the effects of inter-class interference. To further reduce intra-class overlap, CRAS introduces distance-guided anomaly synthesis that adaptively adjusts noise variance based on normal data distribution. Experimental results on diverse datasets and real-world industrial applications demonstrate the superior detection accuracy and competitive inference speed of CRAS. The source code and the newly constructed dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CRAS.

<div> bias-variance tradeoff, diffusion models, generative models, training data, privacy

Summary:
- The paper examines the bias-variance tradeoff in diffusion models, noting that they can amplify bias in training data and compromise privacy.
- It establishes a systematic foundation for understanding how diffusion models operate, focusing on the balance between bias and variance.
- The exploration of generative models aligns with the memorization-generalization framework, uncovering the potential for bias amplification in deeper models.
- The paper introduces a training-free method to enhance output quality in text-to-image and image-to-image generation by encouraging temporary high variance in the generation process.
- This method involves bypassing the mid-block's contribution in the denoising process of diffusion models, resulting in consistent improvements in generative image quality without additional training. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of generative Diffusion Models (DMs), their internal working is still not well understood, which is potentially problematic. This paper focuses on exploring the important notion of bias-variance tradeoff in diffusion models. Providing a systematic foundation for this exploration, it establishes that at one extreme the diffusion models may amplify the inherent bias in the training data and, on the other, they may compromise the presumed privacy of the training samples. Our exploration aligns with the memorization-generalization understanding of the generative models, but it also expands further along this spectrum beyond ``generalization'', revealing the risk of bias amplification in deeper models. Building on the insights, we also introduce a training-free method to improve output quality in text-to-image and image-to-image generation. By progressively encouraging temporary high variance in the generation process with partial bypassing of the mid-block's contribution in the denoising process of DMs, our method consistently improves generative image quality with zero training cost. Our claims are validated both theoretically and empirically.

<div> Keywords: video diffusion models, noise selection, uncertainty quantification, attention-based, Bayesian framework

Summary:
ANSE (Active Noise Selection for Generation) is a framework that enhances video diffusion models by selecting optimal noise seeds based on internal model signals. It utilizes BANSA (Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention), an acquisition function that measures entropy disagreement to estimate model confidence and consistency. A Bernoulli-masked approximation of BANSA allows for efficient inference-time deployment, leading to improved video quality and temporal coherence with minimal increase in inference time. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B and 5B datasets show that ANSE significantly enhances the generation quality of video diffusion models. This approach provides a principled and generalizable method for noise selection in video diffusion. The framework is accessible through the project page for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of initial noise significantly affects the quality and prompt alignment of video diffusion models, where different noise seeds for the same prompt can lead to drastically different generations. While recent methods rely on externally designed priors such as frequency filters or inter-frame smoothing, they often overlook internal model signals that indicate which noise seeds are inherently preferable. To address this, we propose ANSE (Active Noise Selection for Generation), a model-aware framework that selects high-quality noise seeds by quantifying attention-based uncertainty. At its core is BANSA (Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention), an acquisition function that measures entropy disagreement across multiple stochastic attention samples to estimate model confidence and consistency. For efficient inference-time deployment, we introduce a Bernoulli-masked approximation of BANSA that enables score estimation using a single diffusion step and a subset of attention layers. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B and 5B demonstrate that ANSE improves video quality and temporal coherence with only an 8% and 13% increase in inference time, respectively, providing a principled and generalizable approach to noise selection in video diffusion.

<title>Enhancing Fourier-based Doppler Resolution with Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In radar systems, high resolution in the Doppler dimension is important for detecting slow-moving targets as it allows for more distinct separation between these targets and clutter, or stationary objects. However, achieving sufficient resolution is constrained by hardware capabilities and physical factors, leading to the development of processing techniques to enhance the resolution after acquisition. In this work, we leverage artificial intelligence to increase the Doppler resolution in range-Doppler maps. Based on a zero-padded FFT, a refinement via the generative neural networks of diffusion models is achieved. We demonstrate that our method overcomes the limitations of traditional FFT, generating data where closely spaced targets are effectively separated.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation, particularly with autoregressive models, have enabled the synthesis of high-quality videos depicting individual scenes. However, extending these models to generate long, cross-scene videos remains a significant challenge. As the context length grows during autoregressive decoding, computational costs rise sharply, and the model's ability to maintain consistency and adhere to evolving textual prompts deteriorates. We introduce InfLVG, an inference-time framework that enables coherent long video generation without requiring additional long-form video data. InfLVG leverages a learnable context selection policy, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to dynamically identify and retain the most semantically relevant context throughout the generation process. Instead of accumulating the entire generation history, the policy ranks and selects the top-$K$ most contextually relevant tokens, allowing the model to maintain a fixed computational budget while preserving content consistency and prompt alignment. To optimize the policy, we design a hybrid reward function that jointly captures semantic alignment, cross-scene consistency, and artifact reduction. To benchmark performance, we introduce the Cross-scene Video Benchmark (CsVBench) along with an Event Prompt Set (EPS) that simulates complex multi-scene transitions involving shared subjects and varied actions/backgrounds. Experimental results show that InfLVG can extend video length by up to 9$\times$, achieving strong consistency and semantic fidelity across scenes. Our code is available at https://github.com/MAPLE-AIGC/InfLVG.

<title>MODEM: A Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism for Adverse Weather Image Recovery</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17581</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restoring images degraded by adverse weather remains a significant challenge due to the highly non-uniform and spatially heterogeneous nature of weather-induced artifacts, e.g., fine-grained rain streaks versus widespread haze. Accurately estimating the underlying degradation can intuitively provide restoration models with more targeted and effective guidance, enabling adaptive processing strategies. To this end, we propose a Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism (MODEM) for adverse weather image restoration. Central to MODEM is the Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module (MOS2D), which integrates Morton-coded spatial ordering with selective state-space models to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local structural coherence. Complementing MOS2D, we introduce a Dual Degradation Estimation Module (DDEM) that disentangles and estimates both global and local degradation priors. These priors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and context-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex degradation dynamics. Our code will be released at https://github.com/hainuo-wang/MODEM.git.

<title>CGS-GAN: 3D Consistent Gaussian Splatting GANs for High Resolution Human Head Synthesis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17590</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, 3D GANs based on 3D Gaussian splatting have been proposed for high quality synthesis of human heads. However, existing methods stabilize training and enhance rendering quality from steep viewpoints by conditioning the random latent vector on the current camera position. This compromises 3D consistency, as we observe significant identity changes when re-synthesizing the 3D head with each camera shift. Conversely, fixing the camera to a single viewpoint yields high-quality renderings for that perspective but results in poor performance for novel views. Removing view-conditioning typically destabilizes GAN training, often causing the training to collapse. In response to these challenges, we introduce CGS-GAN, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting GAN framework that enables stable training and high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis of human heads without relying on view-conditioning. To ensure training stability, we introduce a multi-view regularization technique that enhances generator convergence with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we adapt the conditional loss used in existing 3D Gaussian splatting GANs and propose a generator architecture designed to not only stabilize training but also facilitate efficient rendering and straightforward scaling, enabling output resolutions up to $2048^2$. To evaluate the capabilities of CGS-GAN, we curate a new dataset derived from FFHQ. This dataset enables very high resolutions, focuses on larger portions of the human head, reduces view-dependent artifacts for improved 3D consistency, and excludes images where subjects are obscured by hands or other objects. As a result, our approach achieves very high rendering quality, supported by competitive FID scores, while ensuring consistent 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Unsupervised pathology detection trains models on non-pathological data to flag deviations as pathologies, offering strong generalizability for identifying novel diseases and avoiding costly annotations. However, building reliable normality models requires vast healthy datasets, as hospitals' data is inherently biased toward symptomatic populations, while privacy regulations hinder the assembly of representative healthy cohorts. To address this limitation, we propose PathoSCOPE, a few-shot unsupervised pathology detection framework that requires only a small set of non-pathological samples (minimum 2 shots), significantly improving data efficiency. We introduce Global-Local Contrastive Loss (GLCL), comprised of a Local Contrastive Loss to reduce the variability of non-pathological embeddings and a Global Contrastive Loss to enhance the discrimination of pathological regions. We also propose a Pathology-informed Embedding Generation (PiEG) module that synthesizes pathological embeddings guided by the global loss, better exploiting the limited non-pathological samples. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 and ChestXray8 datasets, PathoSCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods while maintaining computational efficiency (2.48 GFLOPs, 166 FPS).

Abstract: As the marginal cost of scaling computation (data and parameters) during model pre-training continues to increase substantially, test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising direction for improving generative model performance by allocating additional computation at inference time. While TTS has demonstrated significant success across multiple language tasks, there remains a notable gap in understanding the test-time scaling behaviors of image and video generative models (diffusion-based or flow-based models). Although recent works have initiated exploration into inference-time strategies for vision tasks, these approaches face critical limitations: being constrained to task-specific domains, exhibiting poor scalability, or falling into reward over-optimization that sacrifices sample diversity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Evo}lutionary \textbf{Search} (EvoSearch), a novel, generalist, and efficient TTS method that effectively enhances the scalability of both image and video generation across diffusion and flow models, without requiring additional training or model expansion. EvoSearch reformulates test-time scaling for diffusion and flow models as an evolutionary search problem, leveraging principles from biological evolution to efficiently explore and refine the denoising trajectory. By incorporating carefully designed selection and mutation mechanisms tailored to the stochastic differential equation denoising process, EvoSearch iteratively generates higher-quality offspring while preserving population diversity. Through extensive evaluation across both diffusion and flow architectures for image and video generation tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieves higher diversity, and shows strong generalizability to unseen evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Synthetic X-ray angiographies generated by modern generative models hold great potential to reduce the use of contrast agents in vascular interventional procedures. However, low-quality synthetic angiographies can significantly increase procedural risk, underscoring the need for reliable image quality assessment (IQA) methods. Existing IQA models, however, fail to leverage auxiliary images as references during evaluation and lack fine-grained, task-specific metrics necessary for clinical relevance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CAS-IQA, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework that predicts fine-grained quality scores by effectively incorporating auxiliary information from related images. In the absence of angiography datasets, CAS-3K is constructed, comprising 3,565 synthetic angiographies along with score annotations. To ensure clinically meaningful assessment, three task-specific evaluation metrics are defined. Furthermore, a Multi-path featUre fuSion and rouTing (MUST) module is designed to enhance image representations by adaptively fusing and routing visual tokens to metric-specific branches. Extensive experiments on the CAS-3K dataset demonstrate that CAS-IQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA methods by a considerable margin.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in smart homes must understand human behavior through diverse sensory inputs and communicate via natural language. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled impressive language-grounded perception, their reliance on visual data limits robustness in real-world scenarios with occlusions, poor lighting, or privacy constraints. In this paper, we introduce HoloLLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates uncommon but powerful sensing modalities, such as LiDAR, infrared, mmWave radar, and WiFi, to enable seamless human perception and reasoning across heterogeneous environments. We address two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of aligned modality-text data for rare sensors, and (2) the heterogeneity of their physical signal representations. To overcome these, we design a Universal Modality-Injection Projector (UMIP) that enhances pre-aligned modality embeddings with fine-grained, text-aligned features from tailored encoders via coarse-to-fine cross-attention without introducing significant alignment overhead. We further introduce a human-VLM collaborative data curation pipeline to generate paired textual annotations for sensing datasets. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmarks show that HoloLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, improving language-grounded human sensing accuracy by up to 30%. This work establishes a new foundation for real-world, language-informed multisensory embodied intelligence.

arXiv:2505.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images are often obstructed by various obstacles due to capture limitations, hindering the observation of objects of interest. Most existing methods address occlusions from specific elements like fences or raindrops, but are constrained by the wide range of real-world obstructions, making comprehensive data collection impractical. To overcome these challenges, we propose Instruct2See, a novel zero-shot framework capable of handling both seen and unseen obstacles. The core idea of our approach is to unify obstruction removal by treating it as a soft-hard mask restoration problem, where any obstruction can be represented using multi-modal prompts, such as visual semantics and textual instructions, processed through a cross-attention unit to enhance contextual understanding and improve mode control. Additionally, a tunable mask adapter allows for dynamic soft masking, enabling real-time adjustment of inaccurate masks. Extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution obstacles show that Instruct2See consistently achieves strong performance and generalization in obstruction removal, regardless of whether the obstacles were present during the training phase. Code and dataset are available at https://jhscut.github.io/Instruct2See.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) image segmentation is challenging due to complex spatial layouts and diverse object appearances. While CNNs excel at capturing local features, they struggle with long-range dependencies, whereas Transformers can model global context but often neglect local details and are computationally expensive.We propose a novel approach, Region-Aware Proxy Network (RAPNet), which consists of two components: Contextual Region Attention (CRA) and Global Class Refinement (GCR). Unlike traditional methods that rely on grid-based layouts, RAPNet operates at the region level for more flexible segmentation. The CRA module uses a Transformer to capture region-level contextual dependencies, generating a Semantic Region Mask (SRM). The GCR module learns a global class attention map to refine multi-class information, combining the SRM and attention map for accurate segmentation.Experiments on three public datasets show that RAPNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior multi-class segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning-based multi-view coarse-grained 3D shape classification has achieved remarkable success over the past decade, leveraging the powerful feature learning capabilities of CNN-based and ViT-based backbones. However, as a challenging research area critical for detailed shape understanding, fine-grained 3D classification remains understudied due to the limited discriminative information captured during multi-view feature aggregation, particularly for subtle inter-class variations, class imbalance, and inherent interpretability limitations of parametric model. To address these problems, we propose the first prototype-based framework named Proto-FG3D for fine-grained 3D shape classification, achieving a paradigm shift from parametric softmax to non-parametric prototype learning. Firstly, Proto-FG3D establishes joint multi-view and multi-category representation learning via Prototype Association. Secondly, prototypes are refined via Online Clustering, improving both the robustness of multi-view feature allocation and inter-subclass balance. Finally, prototype-guided supervised learning is established to enhance fine-grained discrimination via prototype-view correlation analysis and enables ad-hoc interpretability through transparent case-based reasoning. Experiments on FG3D and ModelNet40 show Proto-FG3D surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, transparent predictions, and ad-hoc interpretability with visualizations, challenging conventional fine-grained 3D recognition approaches.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D spatio-temporal features. However, existing SNNs still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to inadequate pre-training strategies. These limitations manifest as restricted generalization ability, task specificity, and a lack of multimodal understanding, particularly in challenging tasks such as multimodal question answering and zero-shot 3D classification. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Spike-based Vision-Language (SVL) pretraining framework that empowers SNNs with open-world 3D understanding while maintaining spike-driven efficiency. SVL introduces two key components: (i) Multi-scale Triple Alignment (MTA) for label-free triplet-based contrastive learning across 3D, image, and text modalities, and (ii) Re-parameterizable Vision-Language Integration (Rep-VLI) to enable lightweight inference without relying on large text encoders. Extensive experiments show that SVL achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.4% in zero-shot 3D classification, surpassing advanced ANN models, and consistently outperforms prior SNNs on downstream tasks, including 3D classification (+6.1%), DVS action recognition (+2.1%), 3D detection (+1.1%), and 3D segmentation (+2.1%) with remarkable efficiency. Moreover, SVL enables SNNs to perform open-world 3D question answering, sometimes outperforming ANNs. To the best of our knowledge, SVL represents the first scalable, generalizable, and hardware-friendly paradigm for 3D open-world understanding, effectively bridging the gap between SNNs and ANNs in complex open-world understanding tasks.

<title>Towards Dynamic 3D Reconstruction of Hand-Instrument Interaction in Ophthalmic Surgery</title>

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of hands and instruments is critical for vision-based analysis of ophthalmic microsurgery, yet progress has been hampered by the lack of realistic, large-scale datasets and reliable annotation tools. In this work, we introduce OphNet-3D, the first extensive RGB-D dynamic 3D reconstruction dataset for ophthalmic surgery, comprising 41 sequences from 40 surgeons and totaling 7.1 million frames, with fine-grained annotations of 12 surgical phases, 10 instrument categories, dense MANO hand meshes, and full 6-DoF instrument poses. To scalably produce high-fidelity labels, we design a multi-stage automatic annotation pipeline that integrates multi-view data observation, data-driven motion prior with cross-view geometric consistency and biomechanical constraints, along with a combination of collision-aware interaction constraints for instrument interactions. Building upon OphNet-3D, we establish two challenging benchmarks-bimanual hand pose estimation and hand-instrument interaction reconstruction-and propose two dedicated architectures: H-Net for dual-hand mesh recovery and OH-Net for joint reconstruction of two-hand-two-instrument interactions. These models leverage a novel spatial reasoning module with weak-perspective camera modeling and collision-aware center-based representation. Both architectures outperform existing methods by substantial margins, achieving improvements of over 2mm in Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and up to 23% in ADD-S metrics for hand and instrument reconstruction, respectively.

<title>5G-DIL: Domain Incremental Learning with Similarity-Aware Sampling for Dynamic 5G Indoor Localization</title>

Abstract: Indoor positioning based on 5G data has achieved high accuracy through the adoption of recent machine learning (ML) techniques. However, the performance of learning-based methods degrades significantly when environmental conditions change, thereby hindering their applicability to new scenarios. Acquiring new training data for each environmental change and fine-tuning ML models is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. This paper introduces a domain incremental learning (DIL) approach for dynamic 5G indoor localization, called 5G-DIL, enabling rapid adaptation to environmental changes. We present a novel similarity-aware sampling technique based on the Chebyshev distance, designed to efficiently select specific exemplars from the previous environment while training only on the modified regions of the new environment. This avoids the need to train on the entire region, significantly reducing the time and resources required for adaptation without compromising localization accuracy. This approach requires as few as 50 exemplars from adaptation domains, significantly reducing training time while maintaining high positioning accuracy in previous environments. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art DIL techniques on a challenging real-world indoor dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sample selection method. Our approach is adaptable to real-world non-line-of-sight propagation scenarios and achieves an MAE positioning error of 0.261 meters, even under dynamic environmental conditions.

<title>FutureSightDrive: Thinking Visually with Spatio-Temporal CoT for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Visual language models (VLMs) have attracted increasing interest in autonomous driving due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.

Abstract: Traditional supervised medical image segmentation models require large amounts of labeled data for training; however, obtaining such large-scale labeled datasets in the real world is extremely challenging. Recent semi-supervised segmentation models also suffer from noisy pseudo-label issue and limited supervision in feature space. To solve these challenges, we propose an innovative semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation method to reduce the dependency on large, expert-labeled datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-network architecture to address the limitations of existing methods in using contextual information and generating reliable pseudo-labels. In addition, a self-supervised contrastive learning strategy is used to enhance the representation of the network and reduce prediction uncertainty by distinguishing between reliable and unreliable predictions. Experiments on clinical magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIPMLab/Semi-supervised-Segmentation.

<title>ViP$^2$-CLIP: Visual-Perception Prompting with Unified Alignment for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17692</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to detect anomalies without any target domain training samples, relying solely on external auxiliary data. Existing CLIP-based methods attempt to activate the model's ZSAD potential via handcrafted or static learnable prompts. The former incur high engineering costs and limited semantic coverage, whereas the latter apply identical descriptions across diverse anomaly types, thus fail to adapt to complex variations. Furthermore, since CLIP is originally pretrained on large-scale classification tasks, its anomaly segmentation quality is highly sensitive to the exact wording of class names, severely constraining prompting strategies that depend on class labels. To address these challenges, we introduce ViP$^{2}$-CLIP. The key insight of ViP$^{2}$-CLIP is a Visual-Perception Prompting (ViP-Prompt) mechanism, which fuses global and multi-scale local visual context to adaptively generate fine-grained textual prompts, eliminating manual templates and class-name priors. This design enables our model to focus on precise abnormal regions, making it particularly valuable when category labels are ambiguous or privacy-constrained. Extensive experiments on 15 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that ViP$^{2}$-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust cross-domain generalization.

<title>Seek-CAD: A Self-refined Generative Modeling for 3D Parametric CAD Using Local Inference via DeepSeek</title>

Abstract: The advent of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling will significantly transform the design of industrial products. The recent research endeavor has extended into the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). In contrast to fine-tuning methods, training-free approaches typically utilize the advanced closed-source LLMs, thereby offering enhanced flexibility and efficiency in the development of AI agents for generating CAD parametric models. However, the substantial cost and limitations of local deployment of the top-tier closed-source LLMs pose challenges in practical applications. The Seek-CAD is the pioneer exploration of locally deployed open-source inference LLM DeepSeek-R1 for CAD parametric model generation with a training-free methodology. This study is the first investigation to incorporate both visual and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) feedback within the self-refinement mechanism for generating CAD models. Specifically, the initial generated parametric CAD model is rendered into a sequence of step-wise perspective images, which are subsequently processed by a Vision Language Model (VLM) alongside the corresponding CoTs derived from DeepSeek-R1 to assess the CAD model generation. Then, the feedback is utilized by DeepSeek-R1 to refine the initial generated model for the next round of generation. Moreover, we present an innovative 3D CAD model dataset structured around the SSR (Sketch, Sketch-based feature, and Refinements) triple design paradigm. This dataset encompasses a wide range of CAD commands, thereby aligning effectively with industrial application requirements and proving suitable for the generation of LLMs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Seek-CAD under various metrics.

<title>SeaLion: Semantic Part-Aware Latent Point Diffusion Models for 3D Generation</title>

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have achieved significant success in point cloud generation, enabling numerous downstream applications, such as generative data augmentation and 3D model editing. However, little attention has been given to generating point clouds with point-wise segmentation labels, as well as to developing evaluation metrics for this task. Therefore, in this paper, we present SeaLion, a novel diffusion model designed to generate high-quality and diverse point clouds with fine-grained segmentation labels. Specifically, we introduce the semantic part-aware latent point diffusion technique, which leverages the intermediate features of the generative models to jointly predict the noise for perturbed latent points and associated part segmentation labels during the denoising process, and subsequently decodes the latent points to point clouds conditioned on part segmentation labels. To effectively evaluate the quality of generated point clouds, we introduce a novel point cloud pairwise distance calculation method named part-aware Chamfer distance (p-CD). This method enables existing metrics, such as 1-NNA, to measure both the local structural quality and inter-part coherence of generated point clouds. Experiments on the large-scale synthetic dataset ShapeNet and real-world medical dataset IntrA demonstrate that SeaLion achieves remarkable performance in generation quality and diversity, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art model, DiffFacto, by 13.33% and 6.52% on 1-NNA (p-CD) across the two datasets. Experimental analysis shows that SeaLion can be trained semi-supervised, thereby reducing the demand for labeling efforts. Lastly, we validate the applicability of SeaLion in generative data augmentation for training segmentation models and the capability of SeaLion to serve as a tool for part-aware 3D shape editing.

<title>Slot-MLLM: Object-Centric Visual Tokenization for Multimodal LLM</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a key approach in achieving artificial general intelligence. In particular, vision-language MLLMs have been developed to generate not only text but also visual outputs from multimodal inputs. This advancement requires efficient image tokens that LLMs can process effectively both in input and output. However, existing image tokenization methods for MLLMs typically capture only global abstract concepts or uniformly segmented image patches, restricting MLLMs' capability to effectively understand or generate detailed visual content, particularly at the object level. To address this limitation, we propose an object-centric visual tokenizer based on Slot Attention specifically for MLLMs. In particular, based on the Q-Former encoder, diffusion decoder, and residual vector quantization, our proposed discretized slot tokens can encode local visual details while maintaining high-level semantics, and also align with textual data to be integrated seamlessly within a unified next-token prediction framework of LLMs. The resulting Slot-MLLM demonstrates significant performance improvements over baselines with previous visual tokenizers across various vision-language tasks that entail local detailed comprehension and generation. Notably, this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility of object-centric slot attention performed with MLLMs and in-the-wild natural images.

Abstract: Safety-critical scenarios are rare yet pivotal for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of autonomous driving systems. While existing methods generate safety-critical driving trajectories, simulations, or single-view videos, they fall short of meeting the demands of advanced end-to-end autonomous systems (E2E AD), which require real-world, multi-view video data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SafeMVDrive, the first framework designed to generate high-quality, safety-critical, multi-view driving videos grounded in real-world domains. SafeMVDrive strategically integrates a safety-critical trajectory generator with an advanced multi-view video generator. To tackle the challenges inherent in this integration, we first enhance scene understanding ability of the trajectory generator by incorporating visual context -- which is previously unavailable to such generator -- and leveraging a GRPO-finetuned vision-language model to achieve more realistic and context-aware trajectory generation. Second, recognizing that existing multi-view video generators struggle to render realistic collision events, we introduce a two-stage, controllable trajectory generation mechanism that produces collision-evasion trajectories, ensuring both video quality and safety-critical fidelity. Finally, we employ a diffusion-based multi-view video generator to synthesize high-quality safety-critical driving videos from the generated trajectories. Experiments conducted on an E2E AD planner demonstrate a significant increase in collision rate when tested with our generated data, validating the effectiveness of SafeMVDrive in stress-testing planning modules. Our code, examples, and datasets are publicly available at: https://zhoujiawei3.github.io/SafeMVDrive/.

<title>RQR3D: Reparametrizing the regression targets for BEV-based 3D object detection</title>

arXiv:2505.17732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, fast, and reliable 3D perception is essential for autonomous driving. Recently, bird's-eye view (BEV)-based perception approaches have emerged as superior alternatives to perspective-based solutions, offering enhanced spatial understanding and more natural outputs for planning. Existing BEV-based 3D object detection methods, typically adhering to angle-based representation, directly estimate the size and orientation of rotated bounding boxes. We observe that BEV-based 3D object detection is analogous to aerial oriented object detection, where angle-based methods are recognized for being affected by discontinuities in their loss functions. Drawing inspiration from this domain, we propose Restricted Quadrilateral Representation to define 3D regression targets. RQR3D regresses the smallest horizontal bounding box encapsulating the oriented box, along with the offsets between the corners of these two boxes, thereby transforming the oriented object detection problem into a keypoint regression task. RQR3D is compatible with any 3D object detection approach. We employ RQR3D within an anchor-free single-stage object detection method and introduce an objectness head to address class imbalance problem. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified radar fusion backbone that eliminates the need for voxel grouping and processes the BEV-mapped point cloud with standard 2D convolutions, rather than sparse convolutions. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that RQR3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera-radar 3D object detection, outperforming the previous best method by +4% in NDS and +2.4% in mAP, and significantly reducing the translation and orientation errors, which are crucial for safe autonomous driving. These consistent gains highlight the robustness, precision, and real-world readiness of our approach.

Abstract: While recent advances in image editing have enabled impressive visual synthesis capabilities, current methods remain constrained by explicit textual instructions and limited editing operations, lacking deep comprehension of implicit user intentions and contextual reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new image editing paradigm: reasoning-guided generative editing, which synthesizes images based on complex, multi-faceted textual queries accepting world knowledge and intention inference. To facilitate this task, we first construct a comprehensive dataset featuring over 1,000 image-instruction-edit triples that incorporate rich reasoning contexts and real-world knowledge. We then propose R-Genie: a reasoning-guided generative image editor, which synergizes the generation power of diffusion models with advanced reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models. R-Genie incorporates a reasoning-attention mechanism to bridge linguistic understanding with visual synthesis, enabling it to handle intricate editing requests involving abstract user intentions and contextual reasoning relations. Extensive experimental results validate that R-Genie can equip diffusion models with advanced reasoning-based editing capabilities, unlocking new potentials for intelligent image synthesis.

Abstract: Topology reasoning, which unifies perception and structured reasoning, plays a vital role in understanding intersections for autonomous driving. However, its performance heavily relies on the accuracy of lane detection, particularly at connected lane endpoints. Existing methods often suffer from lane endpoints deviation, leading to incorrect topology construction. To address this issue, we propose TopoPoint, a novel framework that explicitly detects lane endpoints and jointly reasons over endpoints and lanes for robust topology reasoning. During training, we independently initialize point and lane query, and proposed Point-Lane Merge Self-Attention to enhance global context sharing through incorporating geometric distances between points and lanes as an attention mask . We further design Point-Lane Graph Convolutional Network to enable mutual feature aggregation between point and lane query. During inference, we introduce Point-Lane Geometry Matching algorithm that computes distances between detected points and lanes to refine lane endpoints, effectively mitigating endpoint deviation. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that TopoPoint achieves state-of-the-art performance in topology reasoning (48.8 on OLS). Additionally, we propose DET$_p$ to evaluate endpoint detection, under which our method significantly outperforms existing approaches (52.6 v.s. 45.2 on DET$_p$). The code is released at https://github.com/Franpin/TopoPoint.

Abstract: Diffusion-based scene text synthesis has progressed rapidly, yet existing methods commonly rely on additional visual conditioning modules and require large-scale annotated data to support multilingual generation. In this work, we revisit the necessity of complex auxiliary modules and further explore an approach that simultaneously ensures glyph accuracy and achieves high-fidelity scene integration, by leveraging diffusion models' inherent capabilities for contextual reasoning. To this end, we introduce TextFlux, a DiT-based framework that enables multilingual scene text synthesis. The advantages of TextFlux can be summarized as follows: (1) OCR-free model architecture. TextFlux eliminates the need for OCR encoders (additional visual conditioning modules) that are specifically used to extract visual text-related features. (2) Strong multilingual scalability. TextFlux is effective in low-resource multilingual settings, and achieves strong performance in newly added languages with fewer than 1,000 samples. (3) Streamlined training setup. TextFlux is trained with only 1% of the training data required by competing methods. (4) Controllable multi-line text generation. TextFlux offers flexible multi-line synthesis with precise line-level control, outperforming methods restricted to single-line or rigid layouts. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that TextFlux outperforms previous methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Ultrasound is a widely-used imaging modality critical to global healthcare, yet its interpretation remains challenging due to its varying image quality on operators, noises, and anatomical structures. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities across natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection, regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning 15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation, and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of medical ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Ground deformation is regarded in volcanology as a key precursor signal preceding volcanic eruptions. Satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) enables consistent, global-scale deformation tracking; however, deep learning methods remain largely unexplored in this domain, mainly due to the lack of a curated machine learning dataset. In this work, we build on the existing Hephaestus dataset, and introduce Hephaestus Minicubes, a global collection of 38 spatiotemporal datacubes offering high resolution, multi-source and multi-temporal information, covering 44 of the world's most active volcanoes over a 7-year period. Each spatiotemporal datacube integrates InSAR products, topographic data, as well as atmospheric variables which are known to introduce signal delays that can mimic ground deformation in InSAR imagery. Furthermore, we provide expert annotations detailing the type, intensity and spatial extent of deformation events, along with rich text descriptions of the observed scenes. Finally, we present a comprehensive benchmark, demonstrating Hephaestus Minicubes' ability to support volcanic unrest monitoring as a multi-modal, multi-temporal classification and semantic segmentation task, establishing strong baselines with state-of-the-art architectures. This work aims to advance machine learning research in volcanic monitoring, contributing to the growing integration of data-driven methods within Earth science applications.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used to train deep learning models to address data scarcity. However, traditional data augmentation (TDA) typically relies on simple geometric transformation, such as random rotation and rescaling, resulting in minimal data diversity enrichment and limited model performance improvement. State-of-the-art generative models for 3D shape generation rely on the denoising diffusion probabilistic models and manage to generate realistic novel point clouds for 3D content creation and manipulation. Nevertheless, the generated 3D shapes lack associated point-wise semantic labels, restricting their usage in enlarging the training data for point cloud segmentation tasks. To bridge the gap between data augmentation techniques and the advanced diffusion models, we extend the state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, Lion, to a part-aware generative model that can generate high-quality point clouds conditioned on given segmentation masks. Leveraging the novel generative model, we introduce a 3-step generative data augmentation (GDA) pipeline for point cloud segmentation training. Our GDA approach requires only a small amount of labeled samples but enriches the training data with generated variants and pseudo-labeled samples, which are validated by a novel diffusion-based pseudo-label filtering method. Extensive experiments on two large-scale synthetic datasets and a real-world medical dataset demonstrate that our GDA method outperforms TDA approach and related semi-supervised and self-supervised methods.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images from a gallery based on a reference image and modification text as a combined query. Recent approaches focus on balancing global information from two modalities and encode the query into a unified feature for retrieval. However, due to insufficient attention to fine-grained details, these coarse fusion methods often struggle with handling subtle visual alterations or intricate textual instructions. In this work, we propose DetailFusion, a novel dual-branch framework that effectively coordinates information across global and detailed granularities, thereby enabling detail-enhanced CIR. Our approach leverages atomic detail variation priors derived from an image editing dataset, supplemented by a detail-oriented optimization strategy to develop a Detail-oriented Inference Branch. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Feature Compositor that dynamically fuses global and detailed features based on fine-grained information of each unique multimodal query. Extensive experiments and ablation analyses not only demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CIRR and FashionIQ datasets but also validate the effectiveness and cross-domain adaptability of detail enhancement for CIR.

<title>Temporal Consistency Constrained Transferable Adversarial Attacks with Background Mixup for Action Recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17807</link>

Abstract: Action recognition models using deep learning are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are transferable across other models trained on the same data modality. Existing transferable attack methods face two major challenges: 1) they heavily rely on the assumption that the decision boundaries of the surrogate (a.k.a., source) model and the target model are similar, which limits the adversarial transferability; and 2) their decision boundary difference makes the attack direction uncertain, which may result in the gradient oscillation, weakening the adversarial attack. This motivates us to propose a Background Mixup-induced Temporal Consistency (BMTC) attack method for action recognition. From the input transformation perspective, we design a model-agnostic background adversarial mixup module to reduce the surrogate-target model dependency. In particular, we randomly sample one video from each category and make its background frame, while selecting the background frame with the top attack ability for mixup with the clean frame by reinforcement learning. Moreover, to ensure an explicit attack direction, we leverage the background category as guidance for updating the gradient of adversarial example, and design a temporal gradient consistency loss, which strengthens the stability of the attack direction on subsequent frames. Empirical studies on two video datasets, i.e., UCF101 and Kinetics-400, and one image dataset, i.e., ImageNet, demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the transferability of adversarial examples across several action/image recognition models. Our code is available at https://github.com/mlvccn/BMTC_TransferAttackVid.

<title>Seeing It or Not? Interpretable Vision-aware Latent Steering to Mitigate Object Hallucinations</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success but continue to struggle with object hallucination (OH), generating outputs inconsistent with visual inputs. While previous work has proposed methods to reduce OH, the visual decision-making mechanisms that lead to hallucinations remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose VaLSe, a Vision-aware Latent Steering framework that adopts an interpretation-then-mitigation strategy to address OH in LVLMs. By tackling dual challenges of modeling complex vision-language interactions and eliminating spurious activation artifacts, VaLSe can generate visual contribution maps that trace how specific visual inputs influence individual output tokens. These maps reveal the model's vision-aware focus regions, which are then used to perform latent space steering, realigning internal representations toward semantically relevant content and reducing hallucinated outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaLSe is a powerful interpretability tool and an effective method for enhancing model robustness against OH across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers limitations in existing OH evaluation metrics, underscoring the need for more nuanced, interpretable, and visually grounded OH benchmarks in future work. Code is available at: https://github.com/Ziwei-Zheng/VaLSe.

<title>ICPL-ReID: Identity-Conditional Prompt Learning for Multi-Spectral Object Re-Identification</title>

Abstract: Multi-spectral object re-identification (ReID) brings a new perception perspective for smart city and intelligent transportation applications, effectively addressing challenges from complex illumination and adverse weather. However, complex modal differences between heterogeneous spectra pose challenges to efficiently utilizing complementary and discrepancy of spectra information. Most existing methods fuse spectral data through intricate modal interaction modules, lacking fine-grained semantic understanding of spectral information (\textit{e.g.}, text descriptions, part masks, and object keypoints). To solve this challenge, we propose a novel Identity-Conditional text Prompt Learning framework (ICPL), which exploits the powerful cross-modal alignment capability of CLIP, to unify different spectral visual features from text semantics. Specifically, we first propose the online prompt learning using learnable text prompt as the identity-level semantic center to bridge the identity semantics of different spectra in online manner. Then, in lack of concrete text descriptions, we propose the multi-spectral identity-condition module to use identity prototype as spectral identity condition to constraint prompt learning. Meanwhile, we construct the alignment loop mutually optimizing the learnable text prompt and spectral visual encoder to avoid online prompt learning disrupting the pre-trained text-image alignment distribution. In addition, to adapt to small-scale multi-spectral data and mitigate style differences between spectra, we propose multi-spectral adapter that employs a low-rank adaption method to learn spectra-specific features. Comprehensive experiments on 5 benchmarks, including RGBNT201, Market-MM, MSVR310, RGBN300, and RGBNT100, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The task of grading atopic dermatitis (or AD, a form of eczema) from patient images is difficult even for trained dermatologists. Research on automating this task has progressed in recent years with the development of deep learning solutions; however, the rapid evolution of multimodal models and more specifically vision-language models (VLMs) opens the door to new possibilities in terms of explainable assessment of medical images, including dermatology. This report describes experiments carried out to evaluate the ability of seven VLMs to assess the severity of AD on a set of test images.

<title>Locality-Sensitive Hashing for Efficient Hard Negative Sampling in Contrastive Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17844</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning is a representational learning paradigm in which a neural network maps data elements to feature vectors. It improves the feature space by forming lots with an anchor and examples that are either positive or negative based on class similarity. Hard negative examples, which are close to the anchor in the feature space but from a different class, improve learning performance. Finding such examples of high quality efficiently in large, high-dimensional datasets is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose a GPU-friendly Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) scheme that quantizes real-valued feature vectors into binary representations for approximate nearest neighbor search. We investigate its theoretical properties and evaluate it on several datasets from textual and visual domain. Our approach achieves comparable or better performance while requiring significantly less computation than existing hard negative mining strategies.

<title>Multi-task Learning For Joint Action and Gesture Recognition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical applications, computer vision tasks often need to be addressed simultaneously. Multitask learning typically achieves this by jointly training a single deep neural network to learn shared representations, providing efficiency and improving generalization. Although action and gesture recognition are closely related tasks, since they focus on body and hand movements, current state-of-the-art methods handle them separately. In this paper, we show that employing a multi-task learning paradigm for action and gesture recognition results in more efficient, robust and generalizable visual representations, by leveraging the synergies between these tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple action and gesture datasets demonstrate that handling actions and gestures in a single architecture can achieve better performance for both tasks in comparison to their single-task learning variants.

<title>Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Fused Unified Nonconvex Tensor Ring Factors Regularization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17881</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, tensor decomposition-based approaches for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) have gained significant attention in the field of remote sensing. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the global correlations and local smoothness of the background components in hyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial domains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To mitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named HAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR) factors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first decomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then employed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background component. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex regularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to simultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR factors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables the interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and smoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we design a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group sparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex model, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of detection accuracy.

arXiv:2505.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate the impact of harmonization and multi-region CT image feature integration on survival prediction in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, using handcrafted radiomics, pretrained foundation model (FM) features, and clinical data from a multicenter dataset.
  Methods: We analyzed CT scans and clinical data from 876 NSCLC patients (604 training, 272 test) across five centers. Features were extracted from the whole lung, tumor, mediastinal nodes, coronary arteries, and coronary artery calcium (CAC). Handcrafted radiomics and FM deep features were harmonized using ComBat, reconstruction kernel normalization (RKN), and RKN+ComBat. Regularized Cox models predicted overall survival; performance was assessed using the concordance index (C-index), 5-year time-dependent area under the curve (t-AUC), and hazard ratio (HR). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values explained feature contributions. A consensus model used agreement across top region of interest (ROI) models to stratify patient risk.
  Results: TNM staging showed prognostic utility (C-index = 0.67; HR = 2.70; t-AUC = 0.85). The clinical + tumor radiomics model with ComBat achieved a C-index of 0.7552 and t-AUC of 0.8820. FM features (50-voxel cubes) combined with clinical data yielded the highest performance (C-index = 0.7616; t-AUC = 0.8866). An ensemble of all ROIs and FM features reached a C-index of 0.7142 and t-AUC of 0.7885. The consensus model, covering 78% of valid test cases, achieved a t-AUC of 0.92, sensitivity of 97.6%, and specificity of 66.7%.
  Conclusion: Harmonization and multi-region feature integration improve survival prediction in multicenter NSCLC data. Combining interpretable radiomics, FM features, and consensus modeling enables robust risk stratification across imaging centers.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, pixel-level labeling is not always available. Sometimes, we need a semantic segmentation network, and even a visual encoder can have a high compatibility, and can be trained using various types of feedback beyond traditional labels, such as feedback that indicates the quality of the parsing results. To tackle this issue, we proposed RSS (Reward in Semantic Segmentation), the first practical application of reward-based reinforcement learning on pure semantic segmentation offered in two granular levels (pixel-level and image-level). RSS incorporates various novel technologies, such as progressive scale rewards (PSR) and pair-wise spatial difference (PSD), to ensure that the reward facilitates the convergence of the semantic segmentation network, especially under image-level rewards. Experiments and visualizations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed RSS can successfully ensure the convergence of the semantic segmentation network on two levels of rewards. Additionally, the RSS, which utilizes an image-level reward, outperforms existing weakly supervised methods that also rely solely on image-level signals during training.

<title>DiffusionReward: Enhancing Blind Face Restoration through Reward Feedback Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL) has recently shown great potential in aligning model outputs with human preferences across various generative tasks. In this work, we introduce a ReFL framework, named DiffusionReward, to the Blind Face Restoration task for the first time. DiffusionReward effectively overcomes the limitations of diffusion-based methods, which often fail to generate realistic facial details and exhibit poor identity consistency. The core of our framework is the Face Reward Model (FRM), which is trained using carefully annotated data. It provides feedback signals that play a pivotal role in steering the optimization process of the restoration network. In particular, our ReFL framework incorporates a gradient flow into the denoising process of off-the-shelf face restoration methods to guide the update of model parameters. The guiding gradient is collaboratively determined by three aspects: (i) the FRM to ensure the perceptual quality of the restored faces; (ii) a regularization term that functions as a safeguard to preserve generative diversity; and (iii) a structural consistency constraint to maintain facial fidelity. Furthermore, the FRM undergoes dynamic optimization throughout the process. It not only ensures that the restoration network stays precisely aligned with the real face manifold, but also effectively prevents reward hacking. Experiments on synthetic and wild datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving identity consistency and facial details. The source codes, data, and models are available at: https://github.com/01NeuralNinja/DiffusionReward.

<title>Object-level Cross-view Geo-localization with Location Enhancement and Multi-Head Cross Attention</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17911</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization determines the location of a query image, captured by a drone or ground-based camera, by matching it to a geo-referenced satellite image. While traditional approaches focus on image-level localization, many applications, such as search-and-rescue, infrastructure inspection, and precision delivery, demand object-level accuracy. This enables users to prompt a specific object with a single click on a drone image to retrieve precise geo-tagged information of the object. However, variations in viewpoints, timing, and imaging conditions pose significant challenges, especially when identifying visually similar objects in extensive satellite imagery. To address these challenges, we propose an Object-level Cross-view Geo-localization Network (OCGNet). It integrates user-specified click locations using Gaussian Kernel Transfer (GKT) to preserve location information throughout the network. This cue is dually embedded into the feature encoder and feature matching blocks, ensuring robust object-specific localization. Additionally, OCGNet incorporates a Location Enhancement (LE) module and a Multi-Head Cross Attention (MHCA) module to adaptively emphasize object-specific features or expand focus to relevant contextual regions when necessary. OCGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset, CVOGL. It also demonstrates few-shot learning capabilities, effectively generalizing from limited examples, making it suitable for diverse applications (https://github.com/ZheyangH/OCGNet).

Abstract: Determining the type of kidney stones is crucial for prescribing appropriate treatments to prevent recurrence. Currently, various approaches exist to identify the type of kidney stones. However, obtaining results through the reference ex vivo identification procedure can take several weeks, while in vivo visual recognition requires highly trained specialists. For this reason, deep learning models have been developed to provide urologists with an automated classification of kidney stones during ureteroscopies. Nevertheless, a common issue with these models is the lack of training data. This contribution presents a deep learning method based on few-shot learning, aimed at producing sufficiently discriminative features for identifying kidney stone types in endoscopic images, even with a very limited number of samples. This approach was specifically designed for scenarios where endoscopic images are scarce or where uncommon classes are present, enabling classification even with a limited training dataset. The results demonstrate that Prototypical Networks, using up to 25% of the training data, can achieve performance equal to or better than traditional deep learning models trained with the complete dataset.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization, guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline performs competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SplatCo, a structure-view collaborative Gaussian splatting framework for high-fidelity rendering of complex outdoor environments. SplatCo builds upon two novel components: (1) a cross-structure collaboration module that combines global tri-plane representations, which capture coarse scene layouts, with local context grid features that represent fine surface details. This fusion is achieved through a novel hierarchical compensation strategy, ensuring both global consistency and local detail preservation; and (2) a cross-view assisted training strategy that enhances multi-view consistency by synchronizing gradient updates across viewpoints, applying visibility-aware densification, and pruning overfitted or inaccurate Gaussians based on structural consistency. Through joint optimization of structural representation and multi-view coherence, SplatCo effectively reconstructs fine-grained geometric structures and complex textures in large-scale scenes. Comprehensive evaluations on 13 diverse large-scale scenes, including Mill19, MatrixCity, Tanks & Temples, WHU, and custom aerial captures, demonstrate that SplatCo consistently achieves higher reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art methods, with PSNR improvements of 1-2 dB and SSIM gains of 0.1 to 0.2. These results establish a new benchmark for high-fidelity rendering of large-scale unbounded scenes. Code and additional information are available at https://github.com/SCUT-BIP-Lab/SplatCo.

Abstract: Understanding visual scenes is fundamental to human intelligence. While discriminative models have significantly advanced computer vision, they often struggle with compositional understanding. In contrast, recent generative text-to-image diffusion models excel at synthesizing complex scenes, suggesting inherent compositional capabilities. Building on this, zero-shot diffusion classifiers have been proposed to repurpose diffusion models for discriminative tasks. While prior work offered promising results in discriminative compositional scenarios, these results remain preliminary due to a small number of benchmarks and a relatively shallow analysis of conditions under which the models succeed. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of the discriminative capabilities of diffusion classifiers on a wide range of compositional tasks. Specifically, our study covers three diffusion models (SD 1.5, 2.0, and, for the first time, 3-m) spanning 10 datasets and over 30 tasks. Further, we shed light on the role that target dataset domains play in respective performance; to isolate the domain effects, we introduce a new diagnostic benchmark Self-Bench comprised of images created by diffusion models themselves. Finally, we explore the importance of timestep weighting and uncover a relationship between domain gap and timestep sensitivity, particularly for SD3-m. To sum up, diffusion classifiers understand compositionality, but conditions apply! Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/eugene6923/Diffusion-Classifiers-Compositionality.

Abstract: Owing to the typical long-tail data distribution issues, simulating domain-gap-free synthetic data is crucial in robotics, photogrammetry, and computer vision research. The fundamental challenge pertains to credibly measuring the difference between real and simulated data. Such a measure is vital for safety-critical applications, such as automated driving, where out-of-domain samples may impact a car's perception and cause fatal accidents. Previous work has commonly focused on simulating data on one scene and analyzing performance on a different, real-world scene, hampering the disjoint analysis of domain gap coming from networks' deficiencies, class definitions, and object representation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to measuring the domain gap between the real world sensor observations and simulated data representing the same location, enabling comprehensive domain gap analysis. To measure such a domain gap, we introduce a novel metric DoGSS-PCL and evaluation assessing the geometric and semantic quality of the simulated point cloud. Our experiments corroborate that the introduced approach can be used to measure the domain gap. The tests also reveal that synthetic semantic point clouds may be used for training deep neural networks, maintaining the performance at the 50/50 real-to-synthetic ratio. We strongly believe that this work will facilitate research on credible data simulation and allow for at-scale deployment in automated driving testing and digital twinning.

Abstract: Feature engineering for generalized seizure detection models remains a significant challenge. Recently proposed models show variable performance depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end model, ''Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet),'' which efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram (EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution. The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly score-based post-classification processing technique was introduced to reduce the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results were reported and analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177 to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9% and 20.62%, respectively.

Abstract: Feature matching is a necessary step for many computer vision and photogrammetry applications such as image registration, structure-from-motion, and visual localization. Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature detection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC outlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With recent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and proven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions. Despite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical and learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D building camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission systematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching techniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use standard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets consisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and drone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute pose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric ground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data. The results indicate that the learnable feature matching methods vastly outperform traditional approaches regarding accuracy and robustness on our challenging custom datasets with zero to 12 RANSAC-inliers and zero to 0.16 area under the curve. We believe that this work will foster the development of model-based visual localization methods. Link to the code: https://github.com/simBauer/To\_Glue\_or\_not\_to\_Glue

<title>Few-Shot Learning from Gigapixel Images via Hierarchical Vision-Language Alignment and Modeling</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

<title>Canonical Pose Reconstruction from Single Depth Image for 3D Non-rigid Pose Recovery on Limited Datasets</title>

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from 2D inputs, especially for non-rigid objects like humans, presents unique challenges due to the significant range of possible deformations. Traditional methods often struggle with non-rigid shapes, which require extensive training data to cover the entire deformation space. This study addresses these limitations by proposing a canonical pose reconstruction model that transforms single-view depth images of deformable shapes into a canonical form. This alignment facilitates shape reconstruction by enabling the application of rigid object reconstruction techniques, and supports recovering the input pose in voxel representation as part of the reconstruction task, utilizing both the original and deformed depth images. Notably, our model achieves effective results with only a small dataset of approximately 300 samples. Experimental results on animal and human datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Segment Anyword: Mask Prompt Inversion for Open-Set Grounded Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17994</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-set image segmentation poses a significant challenge because existing methods often demand extensive training or fine-tuning and generally struggle to segment unified objects consistently across diverse text reference expressions. Motivated by this, we propose Segment Anyword, a novel training-free visual concept prompt learning approach for open-set language grounded segmentation that relies on token-level cross-attention maps from a frozen diffusion model to produce segmentation surrogates or mask prompts, which are then refined into targeted object masks. Initial prompts typically lack coherence and consistency as the complexity of the image-text increases, resulting in suboptimal mask fragments. To tackle this issue, we further introduce a novel linguistic-guided visual prompt regularization that binds and clusters visual prompts based on sentence dependency and syntactic structural information, enabling the extraction of robust, noise-tolerant mask prompts, and significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. The proposed approach is effective, generalizes across different open-set segmentation tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art results of 52.5 (+6.8 relative) mIoU on Pascal Context 59, 67.73 (+25.73 relative) cIoU on gRefCOCO, and 67.4 (+1.1 relative to fine-tuned methods) mIoU on GranDf, which is the most complex open-set grounded segmentation task in the field.

<title>Clinical Validation of Deep Learning for Real-Time Tissue Oxygenation Estimation Using Spectral Imaging</title>

Abstract: Accurate, real-time monitoring of tissue ischemia is crucial to understand tissue health and guide surgery. Spectral imaging shows great potential for contactless and intraoperative monitoring of tissue oxygenation. Due to the difficulty of obtaining direct reference oxygenation values, conventional methods are based on linear unmixing techniques. These are prone to assumptions and these linear relations may not always hold in practice. In this work, we present deep learning approaches for real-time tissue oxygenation estimation using Monte-Carlo simulated spectra. We train a fully connected neural network (FCN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this task and propose a domain-adversarial training approach to bridge the gap between simulated and real clinical spectral data. Results demonstrate that these deep learning models achieve a higher correlation with capillary lactate measurements, a well-known marker of hypoxia, obtained during spectral imaging in surgery, compared to traditional linear unmixing. Notably, domain-adversarial training effectively reduces the domain gap, optimizing performance in real clinical settings.

Abstract: Reliability and generalization in deep learning are predominantly studied in the context of image classification. Yet, real-world applications in safety-critical domains involve a broader set of semantic tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, which come with a diverse set of dedicated model architectures. To facilitate research towards robust model design in segmentation and detection, our primary objective is to provide benchmarking tools regarding robustness to distribution shifts and adversarial manipulations. We propose the benchmarking tools SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH, along with the most extensive evaluation to date on the reliability and generalization of semantic segmentation and object detection models. In particular, we benchmark 76 segmentation models across four datasets and 61 object detectors across two datasets, evaluating their performance under diverse adversarial attacks and common corruptions. Our findings reveal systematic weaknesses in state-of-the-art models and uncover key trends based on architecture, backbone, and model capacity. SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH are open-sourced in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/benchmarking_reliability_generalization) along with our complete set of total 6139 evaluations. We anticipate the collected data to foster and encourage future research towards improved model reliability beyond classification.

Abstract: Accurate information on the number of building floors, or above-ground storeys, is essential for household estimation, utility provision, risk assessment, evacuation planning, and energy modeling. Yet large-scale floor-count data are rarely available in cadastral and 3D city databases. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that infers floor numbers directly from unrestricted, crowdsourced street-level imagery, avoiding hand-crafted features and generalizing across diverse facade styles. To enable benchmarking, we release the Munich Building Floor Dataset, a public set of over 6800 geo-tagged images collected from Mapillary and targeted field photography, each paired with a verified storey label. On this dataset, the proposed classification-regression network attains 81.2% exact accuracy and predicts 97.9% of buildings within +/-1 floor. The method and dataset together offer a scalable route to enrich 3D city models with vertical information and lay a foundation for future work in urban informatics, remote sensing, and geographic information science. Source code and data will be released under an open license at https://github.com/ya0-sun/Munich-SVI-Floor-Benchmark.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to develop a robust yet flexible visual foundation model for Earth observation. It should possess strong capabilities in recognizing and localizing diverse visual targets while providing compatibility with various input-output interfaces required across different task scenarios. Current systems cannot meet these requirements, as they typically utilize task-specific architecture trained on narrow data domains with limited semantic coverage. Our study addresses these limitations from two aspects: data and modeling. We first introduce an automatic data engine that enjoys significantly better scalability compared to previous human annotation or rule-based approaches. It has enabled us to create the largest dataset of its kind to date, comprising 270K image-text-mask triplets covering an unprecedented range of diverse semantic categories and attribute specifications. Based on this data foundation, we further propose a task unification paradigm that centers around referring expression segmentation. It effectively handles a wide range of vision-centric perception tasks, including classification, detection, segmentation, grounding, etc, using a single model without any task-specific heads. Combining these innovations on data and modeling, we present RemoteSAM, a foundation model that establishes new SoTA on several earth observation perception benchmarks, outperforming other foundation models such as Falcon, GeoChat, and LHRS-Bot with significantly higher efficiency. Models and data are publicly available at https://github.com/1e12Leon/RemoteSAM.

<title>A Wavelet-based Stereo Matching Framework for Solving Frequency Convergence Inconsistency</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18024</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that the EPE evaluation metrics of RAFT-stereo converge inconsistently in the low and high frequency regions, resulting high frequency degradation (e.g., edges and thin objects) during the iterative process. The underlying reason for the limited performance of current iterative methods is that it optimizes all frequency components together without distinguishing between high and low frequencies. We propose a wavelet-based stereo matching framework (Wavelet-Stereo) for solving frequency convergence inconsistency. Specifically, we first explicitly decompose an image into high and low frequency components using discrete wavelet transform. Then, the high-frequency and low-frequency components are fed into two different multi-scale frequency feature extractors. Finally, we propose a novel LSTM-based high-frequency preservation update operator containing an iterative frequency adapter to provide adaptive refined high-frequency features at different iteration steps by fine-tuning the initial high-frequency features. By processing high and low frequency components separately, our framework can simultaneously refine high-frequency information in edges and low-frequency information in smooth regions, which is especially suitable for challenging scenes with fine details and textures in the distance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Wavelet-Stereo outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and ranks 1st on both the KITTI 2015 and KITTI 2012 leaderboards for almost all metrics. We will provide code and pre-trained models to encourage further exploration, application, and development of our innovative framework (https://github.com/SIA-IDE/Wavelet-Stereo).

<title>3D Face Reconstruction Error Decomposed: A Modular Benchmark for Fair and Fast Method Evaluation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18025</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18025</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the standard benchmark metric for 3D face reconstruction, namely geometric error, requires a number of steps, such as mesh cropping, rigid alignment, or point correspondence. Current benchmark tools are monolithic (they implement a specific combination of these steps), even though there is no consensus on the best way to measure error. We present a toolkit for a Modularized 3D Face reconstruction Benchmark (M3DFB), where the fundamental components of error computation are segregated and interchangeable, allowing one to quantify the effect of each. Furthermore, we propose a new component, namely correction, and present a computationally efficient approach that penalizes for mesh topology inconsistency. Using this toolkit, we test 16 error estimators with 10 reconstruction methods on two real and two synthetic datasets. Critically, the widely used ICP-based estimator provides the worst benchmarking performance, as it significantly alters the true ranking of the top-5 reconstruction methods. Notably, the correlation of ICP with the true error can be as low as 0.41. Moreover, non-rigid alignment leads to significant improvement (correlation larger than 0.90), highlighting the importance of annotating 3D landmarks on datasets. Finally, the proposed correction scheme, together with non-rigid warping, leads to an accuracy on a par with the best non-rigid ICP-based estimators, but runs an order of magnitude faster. Our open-source codebase is designed for researchers to easily compare alternatives for each component, thus helping accelerating progress in benchmarking for 3D face reconstruction and, furthermore, supporting the improvement of learned reconstruction methods, which depend on accurate error estimation for effective training.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated AI-generated deepfakes poses critical challenges for digital media authentication and societal security. While existing detection methods perform well within specific generative domains, they exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to manipulations produced by unseen architectures--a fundamental limitation as generative technologies rapidly evolve. We propose CAMME (Cross-Attention Multi-Modal Embeddings), a framework that dynamically integrates visual, textual, and frequency-domain features through a multi-head cross-attention mechanism to establish robust cross-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate CAMME's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, yielding improvements of 12.56% on natural scenes and 13.25% on facial deepfakes. The framework demonstrates exceptional resilience, maintaining (over 91%) accuracy under natural image perturbations and achieving 89.01% and 96.14% accuracy against PGD and FGSM adversarial attacks, respectively. Our findings validate that integrating complementary modalities through cross-attention enables more effective decision boundary realignment for reliable deepfake detection across heterogeneous generative architectures.

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) have revolutionized vision-language tasks by enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning through cross-modal alignment. However, their computational complexity and large memory footprint make them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, such as in-car cameras used for image collection and real-time processing. To address this challenge, we propose Clip4Retrofit, an efficient model distillation framework that enables real-time image labeling on edge devices. The framework is deployed on the Retrofit camera, a cost-effective edge device retrofitted into thousands of vehicles, despite strict limitations on compute performance and memory. Our approach distills the knowledge of the CLIP model into a lightweight student model, combining EfficientNet-B3 with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) projection heads to preserve cross-modal alignment while significantly reducing computational requirements. We demonstrate that our distilled model achieves a balance between efficiency and performance, making it ideal for deployment in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that Clip4Retrofit can perform real-time image labeling and object identification on edge devices with limited resources, offering a practical solution for applications such as autonomous driving and retrofitting existing systems. This work bridges the gap between state-of-the-art vision-language models and their deployment in resource-constrained environments, paving the way for broader adoption of foundation models in edge computing.

Abstract: The use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) such as Stable Diffusion has significantly improved the perceptual quality of All-in-One image Restoration (AiOR) methods, while also enhancing their generalization capabilities. However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Computer vision (CV) models for detection, prediction or classification tasks operate on video data-streams that are often degraded in the real world, due to deployment in real-time or on resource-constrained hardware. It is therefore critical that these models are robust to degraded data, but state of the art (SoTA) models are often insufficiently assessed with these real-world constraints in mind. This is exemplified by Skeletal Human Action Recognition (SHAR), which is critical in many CV pipelines operating in real-time and at the edge, but robustness to degraded data has previously only been shallowly and inconsistently assessed. Here we address this issue for SHAR by providing an important first data degradation benchmark on the most detailed and largest 3D open dataset, NTU-RGB+D-120, and assess the robustness of five leading SHAR models to three forms of degradation that represent real-world issues. We demonstrate the need for this benchmark by showing that the form of degradation, which has not previously been considered, has a large impact on model accuracy; at the same effective frame rate, model accuracy can vary by >40% depending on degradation type. We also identify that temporal regularity of frames in degraded SHAR data is likely a major driver of differences in model performance, and harness this to improve performance of existing models by up to >40%, through employing a simple mitigation approach based on interpolation. Finally, we highlight how our benchmark has helped identify an important degradation-resistant SHAR model based in Rough Path Theory; the LogSigRNN SHAR model outperforms the SoTA DeGCN model in five out of six cases at low frame rates by an average accuracy of 6%, despite trailing the SoTA model by 11-12% on un-degraded data at high frame rates (30 FPS).

Abstract: Neuromorphic Visual Systems, such as spike cameras, have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to capture clear textures under dynamic conditions. This capability effectively mitigates issues related to motion and aperture blur. However, in contrast to conventional RGB modalities that provide dense spatial information, these systems generate binary, spatially sparse frames as a trade-off for temporally rich visual streams. In this context, generative models emerge as a promising solution to address the inherent limitations of sparse data. These models not only facilitate the conditional fusion of existing information from both spike and RGB modalities but also enable the conditional generation based on latent priors. In this study, we introduce a robust generative processing framework named SpikeGen, designed for visual spike streams captured by spike cameras. We evaluate this framework across multiple tasks involving mixed spike-RGB modalities, including conditional image/video deblurring, dense frame reconstruction from spike streams, and high-speed scene novel-view synthesis. Supported by comprehensive experimental results, we demonstrate that leveraging the latent space operation abilities of generative models allows us to effectively address the sparsity of spatial information while fully exploiting the temporal richness of spike streams, thereby promoting a synergistic enhancement of different visual modalities.

Abstract: Vision transformers are ever larger, more accurate, and more expensive to compute. The expense is even more extreme at high resolution as the number of tokens grows quadratically with the image size. We turn to adaptive computation to cope with this cost by learning to predict where to compute. Our LookWhere method divides the computation between a low-resolution selector and a high-resolution extractor without ever processing the full high-resolution input. We jointly pretrain the selector and extractor without task supervision by distillation from a self-supervised teacher, in effect, learning where and what to compute simultaneously. Unlike prior token reduction methods, which pay to save by pruning already-computed tokens, and prior token selection methods, which require complex and expensive per-task optimization, LookWhere economically and accurately selects and extracts transferrable representations of images. We show that LookWhere excels at sparse recognition on high-resolution inputs (Traffic Signs), maintaining accuracy while reducing FLOPs by up to 34x and time by 6x. It also excels at standard recognition tasks that are global (ImageNet classification) or local (ADE20K segmentation), improving accuracy while reducing time by 1.36x.

Abstract: Existed echocardiography segmentation methods often suffer from anatomical inconsistency challenge caused by shape variation, partial observation and region ambiguity with similar intensity across 2D echocardiographic sequences, resulting in false positive segmentation with anatomical defeated structures in challenging low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To provide a strong anatomical guarantee across different echocardiographic frames, we propose a novel segmentation framework named BOTM (Bi-directional Optimal Token Matching) that performs echocardiography segmentation and optimal anatomy transportation simultaneously. Given paired echocardiographic images, BOTM learns to match two sets of discrete image tokens by finding optimal correspondences from a novel anatomical transportation perspective. We further extend the token matching into a bi-directional cross-transport attention proxy to regulate the preserved anatomical consistency within the cardiac cyclic deformation in temporal domain. Extensive experimental results show that BOTM can generate stable and accurate segmentation outcomes (e.g. -1.917 HD on CAMUS2H LV, +1.9% Dice on TED), and provide a better matching interpretation with anatomical consistency guarantee.

Abstract: Prompt learning as a parameter-efficient method that has been widely adopted to adapt Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. While hard-prompt design requires domain expertise and iterative optimization, soft-prompt methods rely heavily on task-specific hard labels, limiting their generalization to unseen categories. Recent popular distillation-based prompt learning methods improve generalization by exploiting larger teacher VLMs and unsupervised knowledge transfer, yet their repetitive teacher model online inference sacrifices the inherent training efficiency advantage of prompt learning. In this paper, we propose {{\large {\textbf{F}}}}aster {{\large {\textbf{D}}}}istillation-{{\large {\textbf{B}}}}ased {{\large {\textbf{P}}}}rompt {{\large {\textbf{L}}}}earning (\textbf{FDBPL}), which addresses these issues by sharing soft supervision contexts across multiple training stages and implementing accelerated I/O. Furthermore, FDBPL introduces a region-aware prompt learning paradigm with dual positive-negative prompt spaces to fully exploit randomly cropped regions that containing multi-level information. We propose a positive-negative space mutual learning mechanism based on similarity-difference learning, enabling student CLIP models to recognize correct semantics while learning to reject weakly related concepts, thereby improving zero-shot performance. Unlike existing distillation-based prompt learning methods that sacrifice parameter efficiency for generalization, FDBPL maintains dual advantages of parameter efficiency and strong downstream generalization. Comprehensive evaluations across 11 datasets demonstrate superior performance in base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset transfer, and robustness tests, achieving $2.2\times$ faster training speed.

Benefiting from the rapid development of deep learning, remarkable progress has been made over the past decade. However, a comprehensive review and analysis of this task remains absent. In this paper, we present the first extensive survey of semantic correspondence methods. We first propose a taxonomy to classify existing methods based on the type of their method designs. These methods are then categorized accordingly, and we provide a detailed analysis of each approach. Furthermore, we aggregate and summarize the results of methods in literature across various benchmarks into a unified comparative table, with detailed configurations to highlight performance variations. Additionally, to provide a detailed understanding on existing methods for semantic matching, we thoroughly conduct controlled experiments to analyse the effectiveness of the components of different methods. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective baseline that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, providing a solid foundation for future research in this field. We hope this survey serves as a comprehensive reference and consolidated baseline for future development. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Visual-AI/Semantic-Correspondence.

Abstract: Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital production, simulation, and embodied intelligence. Our video demos and code are available at https://DanceTog.github.io/.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code will be released later.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enabled promising applications in medical tasks, such as report generation and visual question answering. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench, a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements, computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance, enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases, each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 10 evaluated LVLMs struggle with structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation.

Abstract: In face-to-face conversations, individuals need to switch between speaking and listening roles seamlessly. Existing 3D talking head generation models focus solely on speaking or listening, neglecting the natural dynamics of interactive conversation, which leads to unnatural interactions and awkward transitions. To address this issue, we propose a new task -- multi-round dual-speaker interaction for 3D talking head generation -- which requires models to handle and generate both speaking and listening behaviors in continuous conversation. To solve this task, we introduce DualTalk, a novel unified framework that integrates the dynamic behaviors of speakers and listeners to simulate realistic and coherent dialogue interactions. This framework not only synthesizes lifelike talking heads when speaking but also generates continuous and vivid non-verbal feedback when listening, effectively capturing the interplay between the roles. We also create a new dataset featuring 50 hours of multi-round conversations with over 1,000 characters, where participants continuously switch between speaking and listening roles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the naturalness and expressiveness of 3D talking heads in dual-speaker conversations. We recommend watching the supplementary video: https://ziqiaopeng.github.io/dualtalk.

Abstract: Nanomaterial research is becoming a vital area for energy, medicine, and materials science, and accurate analysis of the nanoparticle topology is essential to determine their properties. Unfortunately, the lack of high-quality annotated datasets drastically hinders the creation of strong segmentation models for nanoscale imaging. To alleviate this problem, we introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative adversarial system that can be trained using a limited number of data samples and generates realistic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from segmentation maps. Our model uses a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net segmentation network equipped with self-attention to capture structural relationships and applies augmentation methods to increase the variety of the dataset. The architecture reached a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_2$ dataset generation, with a further reduction in FID score to nearly 10.39 by using efficient post-processing techniques. By facilitating scalable high-fidelity synthetic dataset generation, our approach can improve the effectiveness of downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues in nanoparticle analysis, thus extending its applications to resource-limited fields.

Abstract: Visual Instruction Tuning (VisIT) data, commonly available as human-assistant conversations with images interleaved in the human turns, are currently the most widespread vehicle for aligning strong LLMs to understand visual inputs, converting them to strong LMMs. While many VisIT datasets are available, most are constructed using ad-hoc techniques developed independently by different groups. They are often poorly documented, lack reproducible code, and rely on paid, closed-source model APIs such as GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude to convert image metadata (labels) into VisIT instructions. This leads to high costs and makes it challenging to scale, enhance quality, or generate VisIT data for new datasets. In this work, we address these challenges and propose an open and unified recipe and approach,~\textbf{\method}, for converting available metadata to VisIT instructions using open LLMs. Our multi-stage \method features an efficient framework for metadata grouping, quality control, data and prompt organization, and conversation sampling. We show that our approach can reproduce or enhance the data quality of available VisIT datasets when applied to the same image data and metadata sources, improving GPT-4 generated VisIT instructions by ~3\% on average and up to 12\% on individual benchmarks using open models, such as Gemma 2 27B and LLaMa 3.1 70B. Additionally, our approach enables effective performance scaling - both in quantity and quality - by enhancing the resulting LMM performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We also analyze the impact of various factors, including conversation format, base model selection, and resampling strategies. Our code, which supports the reproduction of equal or higher-quality VisIT datasets and facilities future metadata-to-VisIT data conversion for niche domains, is released at https://github.com/jacob-hansen/Instructify.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the use of RL beyond reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored, especially for perceptionintensive tasks like object detection and grounding. We propose V-Triune, a Visual Triple Unified Reinforcement Learning system that enables VLMs to jointly learn visual reasoning and perception tasks within a single training pipeline. V-Triune comprises triple complementary components: Sample-Level Data Formatting (to unify diverse task inputs), Verifier-Level Reward Computation (to deliver custom rewards via specialized verifiers) , and Source-Level Metric Monitoring (to diagnose problems at the data-source level). We further introduce a novel Dynamic IoU reward, which provides adaptive, progressive, and definite feedback for perception tasks handled by V-Triune. Our approach is instantiated within off-the-shelf RL training framework using open-source 7B and 32B backbone models. The resulting model, dubbed Orsta (One RL to See Them All), demonstrates consistent improvements across both reasoning and perception tasks. This broad capability is significantly shaped by its training on a diverse dataset, constructed around four representative visual reasoning tasks (Math, Puzzle, Chart, and Science) and four visual perception tasks (Grounding, Detection, Counting, and OCR). Subsequently, Orsta achieves substantial gains on MEGA-Bench Core, with improvements ranging from +2.1 to an impressive +14.1 across its various 7B and 32B model variants, with performance benefits extending to a wide range of downstream tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our unified RL approach for VLMs. The V-Triune system, along with the Orsta models, is publicly available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI.

Abstract: Large vision models (LVM) based gait recognition has achieved impressive performance. However, existing LVM-based approaches may overemphasize gait priors while neglecting the intrinsic value of LVM itself, particularly the rich, distinct representations across its multi-layers. To adequately unlock LVM's potential, this work investigates the impact of layer-wise representations on downstream recognition tasks. Our analysis reveals that LVM's intermediate layers offer complementary properties across tasks, integrating them yields an impressive improvement even without rich well-designed gait priors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple and universal baseline for LVM-based gait recognition, termed BiggerGait. Comprehensive evaluations on CCPG, CAISA-B*, SUSTech1K, and CCGR\_MINI validate the superiority of BiggerGait across both within- and cross-domain tasks, establishing it as a simple yet practical baseline for gait representation learning. All the models and code will be publicly available.

<title>Boosting Open Set Recognition Performance through Modulated Representation Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open set recognition (OSR) problem aims to identify test samples from novel semantic classes that are not part of the training classes, a task that is crucial in many practical scenarios. However, existing OSR methods use a constant scaling factor (the temperature) to the logits before applying a loss function, which hinders the model from exploring both ends of the spectrum in representation learning -- from instance-level to semantic-level features. In this paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated representation learning using our novel negative cosine scheduling scheme. Our scheduling lets the model form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of training by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more neighbors to smooth out rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a richer and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods benefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with mix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our scheme can be folded into any existing OSR method with no overhead. We implement the proposed scheme on top of a number of baselines, using both cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions as well as a few other OSR methods, and find that our scheme boosts both the OSR performance and the closed set performance in most cases, especially on the tougher semantic shift benchmarks.

<title>TokBench: Evaluating Your Visual Tokenizer before Visual Generation</title>

arXiv:2505.18142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we reveal the limitations of visual tokenizers and VAEs in preserving fine-grained features, and propose a benchmark to evaluate reconstruction performance for two challenging visual contents: text and face. Image tokenization has significantly advanced visual generation and multimodal modeling, particularly with autoregressive models due to the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. Autoregressive models typically rely on image tokenizers to compress images into discrete tokens for sequential prediction, whereas diffusion models often operate on continuous latent space to reduce computational costs. However, both visual compression approaches inevitably lose visual information, thereby limiting the upper bound of visual generation quality. To evaluate how these compression losses affect text and faces, the most human-sensitive visual elements, we first collect and curate a collection of text and faces images from existing datasets, ensuring clarity and diversity. For text reconstruction, we employ OCR models to assess the recognition accuracy of the reconstructed text, and then we measure feature similarity between original and reconstructed faces thereby quantifying faces reconstruction fidelity. Our method is highly lightweight, requiring just 2GB memory and 4 minutes to complete evaluations. With our benchmark, we analyze the reconstruction quality of text and faces at various scales across different image tokenizers and VAEs. Our results demonstrate that modern visual tokenizers still struggle to preserve fine-grained features, particularly at smaller scales. Furthermore, we extend this evaluation framework to the video, conducting a comprehensive analysis of video tokenizers. Additionally, we find that traditional metrics fail to accurately reflect the reconstruction performance for faces and text, while our proposed metrics serve as an effective complement.

<title>REN: Fast and Efficient Region Encodings from Patch-Based Image Encoders</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Region Encoder Network (REN), a fast and effective model for generating region-based image representations using point prompts. Recent methods combine class-agnostic segmenters (e.g., SAM) with patch-based image encoders (e.g., DINO) to produce compact and effective region representations, but they suffer from high computational cost due to the segmentation step. REN bypasses this bottleneck using a lightweight module that directly generates region tokens, enabling 60x faster token generation with 35x less memory, while also improving token quality. It uses a few cross-attention blocks that take point prompts as queries and features from a patch-based image encoder as keys and values to produce region tokens that correspond to the prompted objects. We train REN with three popular encoders-DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP-and show that it can be extended to other encoders without dedicated training. We evaluate REN on semantic segmentation and retrieval tasks, where it consistently outperforms the original encoders in both performance and compactness, and matches or exceeds SAM-based region methods while being significantly faster. Notably, REN achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging Ego4D VQ2D benchmark and outperforms proprietary LMMs on Visual Haystacks' single-needle challenge. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/savya08/REN.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language generation, excelling at instruction following and structured output generation. Knowledge graphs play a crucial role in radiology, serving as valuable sources of factual information and enhancing various downstream tasks. However, generating radiology-specific knowledge graphs presents significant challenges due to the specialized language of radiology reports and the limited availability of domain-specific data. Existing solutions are predominantly unimodal, meaning they generate knowledge graphs only from radiology reports while excluding radiographic images. Additionally, they struggle with long-form radiology data due to limited context length. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal VLM-based framework for knowledge graph generation in radiology. Our approach outperforms previous methods and introduces the first multimodal solution for radiology knowledge graph generation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across various visual tasks, yet they remain hindered by the persistent challenge of hallucinations. To address this critical issue, we propose Mixture of Decoding (MoD), a novel approach for hallucination mitigation that dynamically adapts decoding strategies by evaluating the correctness of the model's attention on image tokens. Specifically, MoD measures the consistency between outputs generated from the original image tokens and those derived from the model's attended image tokens, to distinguish the correctness aforementioned. If the outputs are consistent, indicating correct attention, MoD employs a complementary strategy to amplify critical information. Conversely, if the outputs are inconsistent, suggesting erroneous attention, MoD utilizes a contrastive strategy to suppress misleading information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoD significantly outperforms existing decoding methods across multiple mainstream benchmarks, effectively mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/xlchen0205/MoD.

Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP and SAM have recently shown great promise in image segmentation tasks, yet their adaptation to 3D medical imaging-particularly for pathology detection and segmentation-remains underexplored. A critical challenge arises from the domain gap between natural images and medical volumes: existing FMs, pre-trained on 2D data, struggle to capture 3D anatomical context, limiting their utility in clinical applications like tumor segmentation. To address this, we propose an adaptation framework called TAGS: Tumor Adaptive Guidance for SAM, which unlocks 2D FMs for 3D medical tasks through multi-prompt fusion. By preserving most of the pre-trained weights, our approach enhances SAM's spatial feature extraction using CLIP's semantic insights and anatomy-specific prompts. Extensive experiments on three open-source tumor segmentation datasets prove that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models (+46.88% over nnUNet), interactive segmentation frameworks, and other established medical FMs, including SAM-Med2D, SAM-Med3D, SegVol, Universal, 3D-Adapter, and SAM-B (at least +13% over them). This highlights the robustness and adaptability of our proposed framework across diverse medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for harnessing the capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input in-context sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures in-context sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a valuable perspective for interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.

Abstract: Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video, audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a distinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality, cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized Audio--Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including egocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\% and 8.0\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4\% boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming SOTA baselines by 50.23\%. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BASHLab/RAVEN.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal slow-thinking systems have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse visual reasoning tasks. However, their capabilities in text-rich image reasoning tasks remain understudied due to the lack of a systematic benchmark. To address this gap, we propose OCR-Reasoning, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess Multimodal Large Language Models on text-rich image reasoning tasks. The benchmark comprises 1,069 human-annotated examples spanning 6 core reasoning abilities and 18 practical reasoning tasks in text-rich visual scenarios. Furthermore, unlike other text-rich image understanding benchmarks that only annotate the final answers, OCR-Reasoning also annotates the reasoning process simultaneously. With the annotated reasoning process and the final answers, OCR-Reasoning evaluates not only the final answers generated by models but also their reasoning processes, enabling a holistic analysis of their problem-solving abilities. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our results demonstrate the limitations of existing methodologies. Notably, even state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit substantial difficulties, with none achieving accuracy surpassing 50\% across OCR-Reasoning, indicating that the challenges of text-rich image reasoning are an urgent issue to be addressed. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/OCR-Reasoning.

Abstract: Evaluating long-context radiology report generation is challenging. NLG metrics fail to capture clinical correctness, while LLM-based metrics often lack generalizability. Clinical accuracy metrics are more relevant but are sensitive to class imbalance, frequently favoring trivial predictions. We propose the CRG Score, a distribution-aware and adaptable metric that evaluates only clinically relevant abnormalities explicitly described in reference reports. CRG supports both binary and structured labels (e.g., type, location) and can be paired with any LLM for feature extraction. By balancing penalties based on label distribution, it enables fairer, more robust evaluation and serves as a clinically aligned reward function.

Abstract: Data visualizations are powerful tools for communicating patterns in quantitative data. Yet understanding any data visualization is no small feat -- succeeding requires jointly making sense of visual, numerical, and linguistic inputs arranged in a conventionalized format one has previously learned to parse. Recently developed vision-language models are, in principle, promising candidates for developing computational models of these cognitive operations. However, it is currently unclear to what degree these models emulate human behavior on tasks that involve reasoning about data visualizations. This gap reflects limitations in prior work that has evaluated data visualization understanding in artificial systems using measures that differ from those typically used to assess these abilities in humans. Here we evaluated eight vision-language models on six data visualization literacy assessments designed for humans and compared model responses to those of human participants. We found that these models performed worse than human participants on average, and this performance gap persisted even when using relatively lenient criteria to assess model performance. Moreover, while relative performance across items was somewhat correlated between models and humans, all models produced patterns of errors that were reliably distinct from those produced by human participants. Taken together, these findings suggest significant opportunities for further development of artificial systems that might serve as useful models of how humans reason about data visualizations. All code and data needed to reproduce these results are available at: https://osf.io/e25mu/?view_only=399daff5a14d4b16b09473cf19043f18.

Abstract: The segmentation of kidney stones is regarded as a critical preliminary step to enable the identification of urinary stone types through machine- or deep-learning-based approaches. In urology, manual segmentation is considered tedious and impractical due to the typically large scale of image databases and the continuous generation of new data. In this study, the potential of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- a state-of-the-art deep learning framework -- is investigated for the automation of kidney stone segmentation. The performance of SAM is evaluated in comparison to traditional models, including U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net, which, despite their efficiency, frequently exhibit limitations in generalizing to unseen datasets. The findings highlight SAM's superior adaptability and efficiency. While SAM achieves comparable performance to U-Net on in-distribution data (Accuracy: 97.68 + 3.04; Dice: 97.78 + 2.47; IoU: 95.76 + 4.18), it demonstrates significantly enhanced generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, surpassing all U-Net variants by margins of up to 23 percent.

Abstract: With the rise of IoT-based botnet attacks, researchers have explored various learning models for detection, including traditional machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid approaches. A key advancement involves deploying attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies among features, significantly improving detection accuracy. However, most models treat attack instances independently, overlooking inter-instance relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) address this limitation by learning an embedding space via iterative message passing where similar instances are placed closer based on node features and relationships, enhancing classification performance. To further improve detection, attention mechanisms have been embedded within GNNs, leveraging both long-range dependencies and inter-instance connections. However, transforming the high dimensional IoT attack datasets into a graph structured dataset poses challenges, such as large graph structures leading computational overhead. To mitigate this, this paper proposes a framework that first reduces dimensionality of the NetFlow-based IoT attack dataset before transforming it into a graph dataset. We evaluate three dimension reduction techniques--Variational Autoencoder (VAE-encoder), classical autoencoder (AE-encoder), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--and compare their effects on a Graph Attention neural network (GAT) model for botnet attack detection

<title>Variational Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion with Enhanced Dimensional Correlations Modeling</title>

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently shown great promise for modeling complex discrete data, with masked diffusion models (MDMs) offering a compelling trade-off between quality and generation speed. MDMs denoise by progressively unmasking multiple dimensions from an all-masked input, but their performance can degrade when using few denoising steps due to limited modeling of inter-dimensional dependencies. In this paper, we propose Variational Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion (VADD), a novel framework that enhances discrete diffusion with latent variable modeling to implicitly capture correlations among dimensions. By introducing an auxiliary recognition model, VADD enables stable training via variational lower bounds maximization and amortized inference over the training set. Our approach retains the efficiency of traditional MDMs while significantly improving sample quality, especially when the number of denoising steps is small. Empirical results on 2D toy data, pixel-level image generation, and text generation demonstrate that VADD consistently outperforms MDM baselines.

<title>From Flight to Insight: Semantic 3D Reconstruction for Aerial Inspection via Gaussian Splatting and Language-Guided Segmentation</title>

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D reconstruction is critical for aerial inspection tasks such as infrastructure monitoring, structural assessment, and environmental surveying. While traditional photogrammetry techniques enable geometric modeling, they lack semantic interpretability, limiting their effectiveness for automated inspection workflows. Recent advances in neural rendering and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer efficient, photorealistic reconstructions but similarly lack scene-level understanding.
  In this work, we present a UAV-based pipeline that extends Feature-3DGS for language-guided 3D segmentation. We leverage LSeg-based feature fields with CLIP embeddings to generate heatmaps in response to language prompts. These are thresholded to produce rough segmentations, and the highest-scoring point is then used as a prompt to SAM or SAM2 for refined 2D segmentation on novel view renderings. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of various feature field backbones (CLIP-LSeg, SAM, SAM2) in capturing meaningful structure in large-scale outdoor environments. We demonstrate that this hybrid approach enables flexible, language-driven interaction with photorealistic 3D reconstructions, opening new possibilities for semantic aerial inspection and scene understanding.

Abstract: Following the rising popularity of YouTube, there is an emerging problem on this platform called clickbait, which provokes users to click on videos using attractive titles and thumbnails. As a result, users ended up watching a video that does not have the content as publicized in the title. This issue is addressed in this study by proposing an algorithm called BaitRadar, which uses a deep learning technique where six inference models are jointly consulted to make the final classification decision. These models focus on different attributes of the video, including title, comments, thumbnail, tags, video statistics and audio transcript. The final classification is attained by computing the average of multiple models to provide a robust and accurate output even in situation where there is missing data. The proposed method is tested on 1,400 YouTube videos. On average, a test accuracy of 98% is achieved with an inference time of less than 2s.

<title>SUFFICIENT: A scan-specific unsupervised deep learning framework for high-resolution 3D isotropic fetal brain MRI reconstruction</title>

Abstract: High-quality 3D fetal brain MRI reconstruction from motion-corrupted 2D slices is crucial for clinical diagnosis. Reliable slice-to-volume registration (SVR)-based motion correction and super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods are essential. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing SVR and SRR when compared to conventional methods. However, it requires large-scale external training datasets, which are difficult to obtain for clinical fetal MRI. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised iterative SVR-SRR framework for isotropic HR volume reconstruction. Specifically, SVR is formulated as a function mapping a 2D slice and a 3D target volume to a rigid transformation matrix, which aligns the slice to the underlying location in the target volume. The function is parameterized by a convolutional neural network, which is trained by minimizing the difference between the volume slicing at the predicted position and the input slice. In SRR, a decoding network embedded within a deep image prior framework is incorporated with a comprehensive image degradation model to produce the high-resolution (HR) volume. The deep image prior framework offers a local consistency prior to guide the reconstruction of HR volumes. By performing a forward degradation model, the HR volume is optimized by minimizing loss between predicted slices and the observed slices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on large-magnitude motion-corrupted simulation data and clinical data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art fetal brain reconstruction frameworks.

Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorders (PAS) pose significant risks during pregnancy, frequently leading to postpartum hemorrhage during cesarean deliveries and other severe clinical complications, with bleeding severity correlating to the degree of placental invasion. Consequently, accurate prenatal diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes-placenta accreta (PA), placenta increta (PI), and placenta percreta (PP)-is crucial. However, existing guidelines and methodologies predominantly focus on the presence of PAS, with limited research addressing subtype recognition. Additionally, previous multi-class diagnostic efforts have primarily relied on inefficient two-stage cascaded binary classification tasks. In this study, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for efficient one-stage multiclass diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes, based on 4,140 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slices. Our model features two branches: the main classification branch utilizes a residual block architecture comprising multiple residual blocks, while the second branch integrates anatomical features of the uteroplacental area and the adjacent uterine serous layer to enhance the model's attention during classification. Furthermore, we implement a multitask learning strategy to leverage both branches effectively. Experiments conducted on a real clinical dataset demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Background: Accurate assessment of metastatic burden in axillary lymph nodes is crucial for guiding breast cancer treatment decisions, yet conventional imaging modalities struggle to differentiate metastatic burden levels and capture comprehensive lymph node characteristics. This study leverages dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to exploit spectral-spatial information for improved multi-class classification. Purpose: To develop a noninvasive DECT-based model classifying sentinel lymph nodes into three categories: no metastasis ($N_0$), low metastatic burden ($N_{+(1-2)}$), and heavy metastatic burden ($N_{+(\geq3)}$), thereby aiding therapeutic planning. Methods: We propose a novel space-squeeze method combining two innovations: (1) a channel-wise attention mechanism to compress and recalibrate spectral-spatial features across 11 energy levels, and (2) virtual class injection to sharpen inter-class boundaries and compact intra-class variations in the representation space. Results: Evaluated on 227 biopsy-confirmed cases, our method achieved an average test AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91) across three cross-validation folds, outperforming established CNNs (VGG, ResNet, etc). The channel-wise attention and virtual class components individually improved AUC by 5.01% and 5.87%, respectively, demonstrating complementary benefits. Conclusions: The proposed framework enhances diagnostic AUC by effectively integrating DECT's spectral-spatial data and mitigating class ambiguity, offering a promising tool for noninvasive metastatic burden assessment in clinical practice.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces persistent challenges due to severe class imbalance and the frequency-specific distribution of anatomical structures. Most conventional CNN-based methods operate in the spatial domain and struggle to capture minority class signals, often affected by frequency aliasing and limited spectral selectivity. Transformer-based models, while powerful in modeling global dependencies, tend to overlook critical local details necessary for fine-grained segmentation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FreqU-FNet, a novel U-shaped segmentation architecture operating in the frequency domain. Our framework incorporates a Frequency Encoder that leverages Low-Pass Frequency Convolution and Daubechies wavelet-based downsampling to extract multi-scale spectral features. To reconstruct fine spatial details, we introduce a Spatial Learnable Decoder (SLD) equipped with an adaptive multi-branch upsampling strategy. Furthermore, we design a frequency-aware loss (FAL) function to enhance minority class learning. Extensive experiments on multiple medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that FreqU-FNet consistently outperforms both CNN and Transformer baselines, particularly in handling under-represented classes, by effectively exploiting discriminative frequency bands.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) aims to detect the start and end timestamps of actions in a video. However, the training of TAL models requires a substantial amount of manually annotated data. Data programming is an efficient method to create training labels with a series of human-defined labeling functions. However, its application in TAL faces difficulties of defining complex actions in the context of temporal video frames. In this paper, we propose ProTAL, a drag-and-link video programming framework for TAL. ProTAL enables users to define \textbf{key events} by dragging nodes representing body parts and objects and linking them to constrain the relations (direction, distance, etc.). These definitions are used to generate action labels for large-scale unlabelled videos. A semi-supervised method is then employed to train TAL models with such labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProTAL through a usage scenario and a user study, providing insights into designing video programming framework.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of wildfire spread is crucial for effective risk management, emergency response, and strategic resource allocation. In this study, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework for forecasting the final extent of burned areas, using data available at the time of ignition. We leverage a spatio-temporal dataset that covers the Mediterranean region from 2006 to 2022, incorporating remote sensing data, meteorological observations, vegetation maps, land cover classifications, anthropogenic factors, topography data, and thermal anomalies. To evaluate the influence of temporal context, we conduct an ablation study examining how the inclusion of pre- and post-ignition data affects model performance, benchmarking the temporal-aware DL models against a baseline trained exclusively on ignition-day inputs. Our results indicate that multi-day observational data substantially improve predictive accuracy. Particularly, the best-performing model, incorporating a temporal window of four days before to five days after ignition, improves both the F1 score and the Intersection over Union by almost 5% in comparison to the baseline on the test dataset. We publicly release our dataset and models to enhance research into data-driven approaches for wildfire modeling and response.

<title>Distance Estimation in Outdoor Driving Environments Using Phase-only Correlation Method with Event Cameras</title>

Abstract: With the growing adoption of autonomous driving, the advancement of sensor technology is crucial for ensuring safety and reliable operation. Sensor fusion techniques that combine multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and cameras have proven effective, but the integration of multiple devices increases both hardware complexity and cost. Therefore, developing a single sensor capable of performing multiple roles is highly desirable for cost-efficient and scalable autonomous driving systems.
  Event cameras have emerged as a promising solution due to their unique characteristics, including high dynamic range, low latency, and high temporal resolution. These features enable them to perform well in challenging lighting conditions, such as low-light or backlit environments. Moreover, their ability to detect fine-grained motion events makes them suitable for applications like pedestrian detection and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication via visible light.
  In this study, we present a method for distance estimation using a monocular event camera and a roadside LED bar. By applying a phase-only correlation technique to the event data, we achieve sub-pixel precision in detecting the spatial shift between two light sources. This enables accurate triangulation-based distance estimation without requiring stereo vision. Field experiments conducted in outdoor driving scenarios demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves over 90% success rate with less than 0.5-meter error for distances ranging from 20 to 60 meters.
  Future work includes extending this method to full position estimation by leveraging infrastructure such as smart poles equipped with LEDs, enabling event-camera-based vehicles to determine their own position in real time. This advancement could significantly enhance navigation accuracy, route optimization, and integration into intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: In autonomous navigation systems, the solution of the place recognition problem is crucial for their safe functioning. But this is not a trivial solution, since it must be accurate regardless of any changes in the scene, such as seasonal changes and different weather conditions, and it must be generalizable to other environments. This paper presents our method, MinkUNeXt-SI, which, starting from a LiDAR point cloud, preprocesses the input data to obtain its spherical coordinates and intensity values normalized within a range of 0 to 1 for each point, and it produces a robust place recognition descriptor. To that end, a deep learning approach that combines Minkowski convolutions and a U-net architecture with skip connections is used. The results of MinkUNeXt-SI demonstrate that this method reaches and surpasses state-of-the-art performance while it also generalizes satisfactorily to other datasets. Additionally, we showcase the capture of a custom dataset and its use in evaluating our solution, which also achieves outstanding results. Both the code of our solution and the runs of our dataset are publicly available for reproducibility purposes.

Abstract: Automatically evaluating multimodal generation presents a significant challenge, as automated metrics often struggle to align reliably with human evaluation, especially for complex tasks that involve multiple modalities. To address this, we present MMMG, a comprehensive and human-aligned benchmark for multimodal generation across 4 modality combinations (image, audio, interleaved text and image, interleaved text and audio), with a focus on tasks that present significant challenges for generation models, while still enabling reliable automatic evaluation through a combination of models and programs. MMMG encompasses 49 tasks (including 29 newly developed ones), each with a carefully designed evaluation pipeline, and 937 instructions to systematically assess reasoning, controllability, and other key capabilities of multimodal generation models. Extensive validation demonstrates that MMMG is highly aligned with human evaluation, achieving an average agreement of 94.3%. Benchmarking results on 24 multimodal generation models reveal that even though the state-of-the-art model, GPT Image, achieves 78.3% accuracy for image generation, it falls short on multimodal reasoning and interleaved generation. Furthermore, results suggest considerable headroom for improvement in audio generation, highlighting an important direction for future research.

Abstract: With recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and growing interest in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the ability to understand table structures has become increasingly important. This is especially critical in financial domains such as securities reports, where highly accurate question answering (QA) over tables is required. However, tables exist in various formats-including HTML, images, and plain text-making it difficult to preserve and extract structural information. Therefore, multimodal LLMs are essential for robust and general-purpose table understanding. Despite their promise, current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are major representatives of multimodal LLMs, still face challenges in accurately understanding characters and their spatial relationships within documents. In this study, we propose a method to enhance LVLM-based table understanding by incorporating in-table textual content and layout features. Experimental results demonstrate that these auxiliary modalities significantly improve performance, enabling robust interpretation of complex document layouts without relying on explicitly structured input formats.

<title>Towards Prospective Medical Image Reconstruction via Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport</title>

Abstract: Medical image reconstruction from measurement data is a vital but challenging inverse problem. Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However, training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT), a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence. Extensive experiments on MRI and CT reconstruction demonstrate KIDOT's superior performance.

Abstract: Safe and feasible trajectory planning is essential for real-world autonomous driving systems. However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe neurological complication among premature infants, necessitating early and accurate detection from brain ultrasound (US) images to improve clinical outcomes. While recent deep learning methods offer promise for computer-aided diagnosis, challenges remain in capturing both local spatial details and global contextual dependencies critical for segmenting brain anatomies. In this work, we propose an enhanced Residual U-Net architecture incorporating two complementary attention mechanisms: the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Sparse Attention Layer (SAL). The CBAM improves the model's ability to refine spatial and channel-wise features, while the SAL introduces a dual-branch design, sparse attention filters out low-confidence query-key pairs to suppress noise, and dense attention ensures comprehensive information propagation. Extensive experiments on the Brain US dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with a Dice score of 89.04% and IoU of 81.84% for ventricle region segmentation. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating spatial refinement and attention sparsity for robust brain anatomy detection.

Abstract: Despite the advances in Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) benchmarks, their evaluation protocols remain constrained, primarily focusing on either single targets with short queries (containing minimal attributes) or multiple targets from distinctly different queries on a single domain. This limitation significantly hinders the assessment of more complex reasoning capabilities in RES models. We introduce WildRES, a novel benchmark that incorporates long queries with diverse attributes and non-distinctive queries for multiple targets. This benchmark spans diverse application domains, including autonomous driving environments and robotic manipulation scenarios, thus enabling more rigorous evaluation of complex reasoning capabilities in real-world settings. Our analysis reveals that current RES models demonstrate substantial performance deterioration when evaluated on WildRES. To address this challenge, we introduce SynRES, an automated pipeline generating densely paired compositional synthetic training data through three innovations: (1) a dense caption-driven synthesis for attribute-rich image-mask-expression triplets, (2) reliable semantic alignment mechanisms rectifying caption-pseudo mask inconsistencies via Image-Text Aligned Grouping, and (3) domain-aware augmentations incorporating mosaic composition and superclass replacement to emphasize generalization ability and distinguishing attributes over object categories. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SynRES achieve state-of-the-art performance, improving gIoU by 2.0% on WildRES-ID and 3.8% on WildRES-DS. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/UTLLab/SynRES.

<title>Soft-CAM: Making black box models self-explainable for high-stakes decisions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for high-stakes applications like medicine, often surpassing human performance. However, most explanation methods rely on post-hoc attribution, approximating the decision-making process of already trained black-box models. These methods are often sensitive, unreliable, and fail to reflect true model reasoning, limiting their trustworthiness in critical applications. In this work, we introduce SoftCAM, a straightforward yet effective approach that makes standard CNN architectures inherently interpretable. By removing the global average pooling layer and replacing the fully connected classification layer with a convolution-based class evidence layer, SoftCAM preserves spatial information and produces explicit class activation maps that form the basis of the model's predictions. Evaluated on three medical datasets, SoftCAM maintains classification performance while significantly improving both the qualitative and quantitative explanation compared to existing post-hoc methods. Our results demonstrate that CNNs can be inherently interpretable without compromising performance, advancing the development of self-explainable deep learning for high-stakes decision-making.

Abstract: Coreset selection targets the challenge of finding a small, representative subset of a large dataset that preserves essential patterns for effective machine learning. Although several surveys have examined data reduction strategies before, most focus narrowly on either classical geometry-based methods or active learning techniques. In contrast, this survey presents a more comprehensive view by unifying three major lines of coreset research, namely, training-free, training-oriented, and label-free approaches, into a single taxonomy. We present subfields often overlooked by existing work, including submodular formulations, bilevel optimization, and recent progress in pseudo-labeling for unlabeled datasets. Additionally, we examine how pruning strategies influence generalization and neural scaling laws, offering new insights that are absent from prior reviews. Finally, we compare these methods under varying computational, robustness, and performance demands and highlight open challenges, such as robustness, outlier filtering, and adapting coreset selection to foundation models, for future research.

<title>Multi-Person Interaction Generation from Two-Person Motion Priors</title>

Abstract: Generating realistic human motion with high-level controls is a crucial task for social understanding, robotics, and animation. With high-quality MOCAP data becoming more available recently, a wide range of data-driven approaches have been presented. However, modelling multi-person interactions still remains a less explored area. In this paper, we present Graph-driven Interaction Sampling, a method that can generate realistic and diverse multi-person interactions by leveraging existing two-person motion diffusion models as motion priors. Instead of training a new model specific to multi-person interaction synthesis, our key insight is to spatially and temporally separate complex multi-person interactions into a graph structure of two-person interactions, which we name the Pairwise Interaction Graph. We thus decompose the generation task into simultaneous single-person motion generation conditioned on one other's motion. In addition, to reduce artifacts such as interpenetrations of body parts in generated multi-person interactions, we introduce two graph-dependent guidance terms into the diffusion sampling scheme. Unlike previous work, our method can produce various high-quality multi-person interactions without having repetitive individual motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in reducing artifacts when generating a wide range of two-person and multi-person interactions.

Abstract: Concepts such as objects, patterns, and shapes are how humans understand the world. Building on this intuition, concept-based explainability methods aim to study representations learned by deep neural networks in relation to human-understandable concepts. Here, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are an important tool and can identify whether a model learned a concept or not. However, the computational cost and time requirements of existing CAV computation pose a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale, high-dimensional architectures. To address this limitation, we introduce FastCAV, a novel approach that accelerates the extraction of CAVs by up to 63.6x (on average 46.4x). We provide a theoretical foundation for our approach and give concrete assumptions under which it is equivalent to established SVM-based methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that CAVs calculated with FastCAV maintain similar performance while being more efficient and stable. In downstream applications, i.e., concept-based explanation methods, we show that FastCAV can act as a replacement leading to equivalent insights. Hence, our approach enables previously infeasible investigations of deep models, which we demonstrate by tracking the evolution of concepts during model training.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, general-purpose generation has gained increasing attention as a promising approach to unify diverse tasks across modalities within a single system. Despite this progress, existing open-source frameworks often remain fragile and struggle to support complex real-world applications due to the lack of structured workflow planning and execution-level feedback. To address these limitations, we present ComfyMind, a collaborative AI system designed to enable robust and scalable general-purpose generation, built on the ComfyUI platform. ComfyMind introduces two core innovations: Semantic Workflow Interface (SWI) that abstracts low-level node graphs into callable functional modules described in natural language, enabling high-level composition and reducing structural errors; Search Tree Planning mechanism with localized feedback execution, which models generation as a hierarchical decision process and allows adaptive correction at each stage. Together, these components improve the stability and flexibility of complex generative workflows. We evaluate ComfyMind on three public benchmarks: ComfyBench, GenEval, and Reason-Edit, which span generation, editing, and reasoning tasks. Results show that ComfyMind consistently outperforms existing open-source baselines and achieves performance comparable to GPT-Image-1. ComfyMind paves a promising path for the development of open-source general-purpose generative AI systems. Project page: https://github.com/LitaoGuo/ComfyMind

<title>UltraBoneUDF: Self-supervised Bone Surface Reconstruction from Ultrasound Based on Neural Unsigned Distance Functions</title>

Abstract: Background: Bone surface reconstruction plays a critical role in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. Compared to traditional imaging modalities such as CT and MRI, ultrasound offers a radiation-free, cost-effective, and portable alternative. Continuous bone surface reconstruction can be employed for many clinical applications. However, due to the inherent limitations of ultrasound imaging, B-mode ultrasound typically capture only partial bone surfaces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle with such incomplete data, leading to artifacts and increased reconstruction errors. Effective techniques for accurately reconstructing thin and open bone surfaces from real-world 3D ultrasound volumes remain lacking. Methods: We propose UltraBoneUDF, a self-supervised framework designed for reconstructing open bone surfaces from ultrasound using neural Unsigned Distance Functions. To enhance reconstruction quality, we introduce a novel global feature extractor that effectively fuses ultrasound-specific image characteristics. Additionally, we present a novel loss function based on local tangent plane optimization that substantially improves surface reconstruction quality. UltraBoneUDF and baseline models are extensively evaluated on four open-source datasets. Results: Qualitative results highlight the limitations of the state-of-the-art methods for open bone surface reconstruction and demonstrate the effectiveness of UltraBoneUDF. Quantitatively, UltraBoneUDF significantly outperforms competing methods across all evaluated datasets for both open and closed bone surface reconstruction in terms of mean Chamfer distance error: 1.10 mm on the UltraBones100k dataset (39.6\% improvement compared to the SOTA), 0.23 mm on the OpenBoneCT dataset (69.3\% improvement), 0.18 mm on the ClosedBoneCT dataset (70.2\% improvement), and 0.05 mm on the Prostate dataset (55.3\% improvement).

Abstract: Automated segmentation of cancer on medical images can aid targeted diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, its adoption is limited by the high cost of expert annotations required for training and inter-observer variability in datasets. While weakly-supervised methods mitigate some challenges, using binary histology labels for training as opposed to requiring full segmentation, they require large paired datasets of histology and images, which are difficult to curate. Similarly, promptable segmentation aims to allow segmentation with no re-training for new tasks at inference, however, existing models perform poorly on pathological regions, again necessitating large datasets for training. In this work we propose a novel approach for promptable segmentation requiring only 24 fully-segmented images, supplemented by 8 weakly-labelled images, for training. Curating this minimal data to a high standard is relatively feasible and thus issues with the cost and variability of obtaining labels can be mitigated. By leveraging two classifiers, one weakly-supervised and one fully-supervised, our method refines segmentation through a guided search process initiated by a single-point prompt. Our approach outperforms existing promptable segmentation methods, and performs comparably with fully-supervised methods, for the task of prostate cancer segmentation, while using substantially less annotated data (up to 100X less). This enables promptable segmentation with very minimal labelled data, such that the labels can be curated to a very high standard.

Abstract: This paper evaluates single-view mesh reconstruction models for creating digital twin environments in robot manipulation. Recent advances in computer vision for 3D reconstruction from single viewpoints present a potential breakthrough for efficiently creating virtual replicas of physical environments for robotics contexts. However, their suitability for physics simulations and robotics applications remains unexplored. We establish benchmarking criteria for 3D reconstruction in robotics contexts, including handling typical inputs, producing collision-free and stable reconstructions, managing occlusions, and meeting computational constraints. Our empirical evaluation using realistic robotics datasets shows that despite success on computer vision benchmarks, existing approaches fail to meet robotics-specific requirements. We quantitively examine limitations of single-view reconstruction for practical robotics implementation, in contrast to prior work that focuses on multi-view approaches. Our findings highlight critical gaps between computer vision advances and robotics needs, guiding future research at this intersection.

Abstract: We present a fully automated, anatomically guided deep learning pipeline for prostate cancer (PCa) risk stratification using routine MRI. The pipeline integrates three key components: an nnU-Net module for segmenting the prostate gland and its zones on axial T2-weighted MRI; a classification module based on the UMedPT Swin Transformer foundation model, fine-tuned on 3D patches with optional anatomical priors and clinical data; and a VAE-GAN framework for generating counterfactual heatmaps that localize decision-driving image regions. The system was developed using 1,500 PI-CAI cases for segmentation and 617 biparametric MRIs with metadata from the CHAIMELEON challenge for classification (split into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing). Segmentation achieved mean Dice scores of 0.95 (gland), 0.94 (peripheral zone), and 0.92 (transition zone). Incorporating gland priors improved AUC from 0.69 to 0.72, with a three-scale ensemble achieving top performance (AUC = 0.79, composite score = 0.76), outperforming the 2024 CHAIMELEON challenge winners. Counterfactual heatmaps reliably highlighted lesions within segmented regions, enhancing model interpretability. In a prospective multi-center in-silico trial with 20 clinicians, AI assistance increased diagnostic accuracy from 0.72 to 0.77 and Cohen's kappa from 0.43 to 0.53, while reducing review time per case by 40%. These results demonstrate that anatomy-aware foundation models with counterfactual explainability can enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient PCa risk assessment, supporting their potential use as virtual biopsies in clinical practice.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) examples is an important task for deploying reliable machine learning models in safety-critial applications. While post-hoc methods based on the Mahalanobis distance applied to pre-logit features are among the most effective for ImageNet-scale OOD detection, their performance varies significantly across models. We connect this inconsistency to strong variations in feature norms, indicating severe violations of the Gaussian assumption underlying the Mahalanobis distance estimation. We show that simple $\ell_2$-normalization of the features mitigates this problem effectively, aligning better with the premise of normally distributed data with shared covariance matrix. Extensive experiments on 44 models across diverse architectures and pretraining schemes show that $\ell_2$-normalization improves the conventional Mahalanobis distance-based approaches significantly and consistently, and outperforms other recently proposed OOD detection methods.

Abstract: Background: Accurate MRI-based identification of extramural vascular invasion (EVI) and mesorectal fascia invasion (MFI) is pivotal for risk-stratified management of rectal cancer, yet visual assessment is subjective and vulnerable to inter-institutional variability. Purpose: To develop and externally evaluate a multicenter, foundation-model-driven framework that automatically classifies EVI and MFI on axial and sagittal T2-weighted MRI. Methods: This retrospective study used 331 pre-treatment rectal cancer MRI examinations from three European hospitals. After TotalSegmentator-guided rectal patch extraction, a self-supervised frequency-domain harmonization pipeline was trained to minimize scanner-related contrast shifts. Four classifiers were compared: ResNet50, SeResNet, the universal biomedical pretrained transformer (UMedPT) with a lightweight MLP head, and a logistic-regression variant using frozen UMedPT features (UMedPT_LR). Results: UMedPT_LR achieved the best EVI detection when axial and sagittal features were fused (AUC = 0.82; sensitivity = 0.75; F1 score = 0.73), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.74). The highest MFI performance was attained by UMedPT on axial harmonized images (AUC = 0.77), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.75). Frequency-domain harmonization improved MFI classification but variably affected EVI performance. Conventional CNNs (ResNet50, SeResNet) underperformed, especially in F1 score and balanced accuracy. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that combining foundation model features, harmonization, and multi-view fusion significantly enhances diagnostic performance in rectal MRI.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have become a well-explored domain, frequently serving as evaluation baselines for model robustness. Among these, black-box attacks based on transferability have received significant attention due to their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. Traditional black-box methods have generally focused on improving the optimization framework (e.g., utilizing momentum in MI-FGSM) to enhance transferability, rather than examining the dependency on surrogate white-box model architectures. Recent state-of-the-art approach DiffPGD has demonstrated enhanced transferability by employing diffusion-based adversarial purification models for adaptive attacks. The inductive bias of diffusion-based adversarial purification aligns naturally with the adversarial attack process, where both involving noise addition, reducing dependency on surrogate white-box model selection. However, the denoising process of diffusion models incurs substantial computational costs through chain rule derivation, manifested in excessive VRAM consumption and extended runtime. This progression prompts us to question whether introducing diffusion models is necessary. We hypothesize that a model sharing similar inductive bias to diffusion-based adversarial purification, combined with an appropriate loss function, could achieve comparable or superior transferability while dramatically reducing computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function coupled with a unique surrogate model to validate our hypothesis. Our approach leverages the score of the time-dependent classifier from classifier-guided diffusion models, effectively incorporating natural data distribution knowledge into the adversarial optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate significantly improved transferability across diverse model architectures while maintaining robustness against diffusion-based defenses.

Abstract: As learned image compression (LIC) methods become increasingly computationally demanding, enhancing their training efficiency is crucial. This paper takes a step forward in accelerating the training of LIC methods by modeling the neural training dynamics. We first propose a Sensitivity-aware True and Dummy Embedding Training mechanism (STDET) that clusters LIC model parameters into few separate modes where parameters are expressed as affine transformations of reference parameters within the same mode. By further utilizing the stable intra-mode correlations throughout training and parameter sensitivities, we gradually embed non-reference parameters, reducing the number of trainable parameters. Additionally, we incorporate a Sampling-then-Moving Average (SMA) technique, interpolating sampled weights from stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training to obtain the moving average weights, ensuring smooth temporal behavior and minimizing training state variances. Overall, our method significantly reduces training space dimensions and the number of trainable parameters without sacrificing model performance, thus accelerating model convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the Noisy quadratic model, showing that the proposed method achieves a lower training variance than standard SGD. Our approach offers valuable insights for further developing efficient training methods for LICs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved strong results on coding and math benchmarks that are challenging for humans, yet their ability to perform tasks that come naturally to humans--such as perception, spatial navigation, and memory management--remains understudied. Real video games are crafted to be intuitive for humans to learn and master by leveraging innate inductive biases, making them an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities in VLMs. To this end, we introduce VideoGameBench, a benchmark consisting of 10 popular video games from the 1990s that VLMs directly interact with in real-time. VideoGameBench challenges models to complete entire games with access to only raw visual inputs and a high-level description of objectives and controls, a significant departure from existing setups that rely on game-specific scaffolding and auxiliary information. We keep three of the games secret to encourage solutions that generalize to unseen environments. Our experiments show that frontier vision-language models struggle to progress beyond the beginning of each game. We find inference latency to be a major limitation of frontier models in the real-time setting; therefore, we introduce VideoGameBench Lite, a setting where the game pauses while waiting for the LM's next action. The best performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, completes only 0.48% of VideoGameBench and 1.6% of VideoGameBench Lite. We hope that the formalization of the human skills mentioned above into this benchmark motivates progress in these research directions.

Abstract: WonderPlay is a novel framework integrating physics simulation with video generation for generating action-conditioned dynamic 3D scenes from a single image. While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic dynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a wide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics solver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video generator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated video is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop between the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables intuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of physics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video generators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to interact with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow, liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input. Code will be made public. Project website: https://kyleleey.github.io/WonderPlay/

However, most existing DUNs solely rely on the image-domain unfolding, which restricts the information transmission capacity and reconstruction flexibility, leading to their loss of image details and unsatisfactory performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a dual-domain optimization framework that combines the priors of (1) image- and (2) convolutional-coding-domains and offers generality to CS and other inverse imaging tasks. By converting this optimization framework into deep NN structures, we present a Dual-Domain Deep Convolutional Coding Network (D3C2-Net), which enjoys the ability to efficiently transmit high-capacity self-adaptive convolutional features across all its unfolded stages. Our theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data, covering 2D and 3D natural, medical, and scientific signals, demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality, superior performance, and generalization ability of our method over other competing approaches and its significant potential in achieving a balance among accuracy, complexity, and interpretability.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation is useful for gaming, the film industry, and AR/VR applications. However, existing methods cannot faithfully capture the room layout, nor do they allow flexible editing of individual objects in the room. To address these problems, we present Ctrl-Room, which can generate convincing 3D rooms with designer-style layouts and high-fidelity textures from just a text prompt. Moreover, Ctrl-Room enables versatile interactive editing operations such as resizing or moving individual furniture items. Our key insight is to separate the modeling of layouts and appearance. Our proposed method consists of two stages: a Layout Generation Stage and an Appearance Generation Stage. The Layout Generation Stage trains a text-conditional diffusion model to learn the layout distribution with our holistic scene code parameterization. Next, the Appearance Generation Stage employs a fine-tuned ControlNet to produce a vivid panoramic image of the room guided by the 3D scene layout and text prompt. We thus achieve a high-quality 3D room generation with convincing layouts and lively textures. Benefiting from the scene code parameterization, we can easily edit the generated room model through our mask-guided editing module, without expensive edit-specific training. Extensive experiments on the Structured3D dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in producing more reasonable, view-consistent, and editable 3D rooms from natural language prompts.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to help reduce the cost of the manual labelling process by leveraging a substantial pool of unlabelled data alongside a limited set of labelled data during the training phase. Since pixel-level manual labelling in large-scale remote sensing imagery is expensive and time-consuming, semi-supervised learning has become a widely used solution to deal with this. However, the majority of existing SSL frameworks, especially various teacher-student frameworks, are too bulky to run efficiently on a GPU with limited memory. There is still a lack of lightweight SSL frameworks and efficient perturbation methods to promote the diversity of training samples and enhance the precision of pseudo labels during training. In order to fill this gap, we proposed a simple, lightweight, and efficient SSL architecture named \textit{DiverseHead}, which promotes the utilisation of multiple decision heads instead of multiple whole networks. Another limitation of most existing SSL frameworks is the insufficient diversity of pseudo labels, as they rely on the same network architecture and fail to explore different structures for generating pseudo labels. To solve this issue, we propose \textit{DiverseModel} to explore and analyse different networks in parallel for SSL to increase the diversity of pseudo labels. The two proposed methods, namely \textit{DiverseHead} and \textit{DiverseModel}, both achieve competitive semantic segmentation performance in four widely used remote sensing imagery datasets compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. Meanwhile, the proposed lightweight DiverseHead architecture can be easily applied to various state-of-the-art SSL methods while further improving their performance. The code is available at https://github.com/WANLIMA-CARDIFF/DiverseNet.

Abstract: Neural fields encode continuous multidimensional signals as neural networks, enabling diverse applications in computer vision, robotics, and geometry. While Adam is effective for stochastic optimization, it often requires long training times. To address this, we explore alternative optimization techniques to accelerate training without sacrificing accuracy. Traditional second-order methods like L-BFGS are unsuitable for stochastic settings. We propose a theoretical framework for training neural fields with curvature-aware diagonal preconditioners, demonstrating their effectiveness across tasks such as image reconstruction, shape modeling, and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).

Abstract: Considering that scene flow estimation has the capability of the spatial domain to focus but lacks the coherence of the temporal domain, this study proposes long-term scene flow estimation (LSFE), a comprehensive task that can simultaneously capture the fine-grained and long-term 3D motion in an online manner. We introduce SceneTracker, the first LSFE network that adopts an iterative approach to approximate the optimal 3D trajectory. The network dynamically and simultaneously indexes and constructs appearance correlation and depth residual features. Transformers are then employed to explore and utilize long-range connections within and between trajectories. With detailed experiments, SceneTracker shows superior capabilities in addressing 3D spatial occlusion and depth noise interference, highly tailored to the needs of the LSFE task. We build a real-world evaluation dataset, LSFDriving, for the LSFE field and use it in experiments to further demonstrate the advantage of SceneTracker in generalization abilities. The code and data are available at https://github.com/wwsource/SceneTracker.

Abstract: Environment prediction frameworks are critical for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dynamic settings. LiDAR-generated occupancy grid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's-eye view for the scene representation, enabling self-supervised joint scene predictions while exhibiting resilience to partial observability and perception detection failures. Prior approaches have focused on deterministic L-OGM prediction architectures within the grid cell space. While these methods have seen some success, they frequently produce unrealistic predictions and fail to capture the stochastic nature of the environment. Additionally, they do not effectively integrate additional sensor modalities present in AVs. Our proposed framework, Latent Occupancy Prediction (LOPR), performs stochastic L-OGM prediction in the latent space of a generative architecture and allows for conditioning on RGB cameras, maps, and planned trajectories. We decode predictions using either a single-step decoder, which provides high-quality predictions in real-time, or a diffusion-based batch decoder, which can further refine the decoded frames to address temporal consistency issues and reduce compression losses. Our experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets show that all variants of our approach qualitatively and quantitatively outperform prior approaches.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) medical images, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), are essential for clinical applications. However, the need for diverse and comprehensive representations is particularly pronounced when considering the variability across different organs, diagnostic tasks, and imaging modalities. How to effectively interpret the intricate contextual information and extract meaningful insights from these images remains an open challenge to the community. While current self-supervised learning methods have shown potential, they often consider an image as a whole thereby overlooking the extensive, complex relationships among local regions from one or multiple images. In this work, we introduce a pioneering method for learning 3D medical image representations through an autoregressive pre-training framework. Our approach sequences various 3D medical images based on spatial, contrast, and semantic correlations, treating them as interconnected visual tokens within a token sequence. By employing an autoregressive sequence modeling task, we predict the next visual token in the sequence, which allows our model to deeply understand and integrate the contextual information inherent in 3D medical images. Additionally, we implement a random startup strategy to avoid overestimating token relationships and to enhance the robustness of learning. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the superior performance over others on nine downstream tasks in public datasets.

Abstract: Hybrid Mamba-Transformer networks have recently garnered broad attention. These networks can leverage the scalability of Transformers while capitalizing on Mamba's strengths in long-context modeling and computational efficiency. However, the challenge of effectively pretraining such hybrid networks remains an open question. Existing methods, such as Masked Autoencoders (MAE) or autoregressive (AR) pretraining, primarily focus on single-type network architectures. In contrast, pretraining strategies for hybrid architectures must be effective for both Mamba and Transformer components. Based on this, we propose Masked Autoregressive Pretraining (MAP) to pretrain a hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network. This strategy combines the strengths of both MAE and Autoregressive pretraining, improving the performance of Mamba and Transformer modules within a unified paradigm. Experimental results show that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network pretrained with MAP significantly outperforms other pretraining strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We validate the method's effectiveness on both 2D and 3D datasets and provide detailed ablation studies to support the design choices for each component.

<title>RCR: Robust Crowd Reconstruction with Upright Space from a Single Large-scene Image</title>

Abstract: This paper focuses on spatially consistent hundreds of human pose and shape reconstruction from a single large-scene image with various human scales under arbitrary camera FoVs (Fields of View). Due to the small and highly varying 2D human scales, depth ambiguity, and perspective distortion, no existing methods can achieve globally consistent reconstruction with correct reprojection. To address these challenges, we first propose a new concept, Human-scene Virtual Interaction Point (HVIP), to convert the complex 3D human localization into 2D-pixel localization. We then extend it to RCR (Robust Crowd Reconstruction), which achieves globally consistent reconstruction and stable generalization on different camera FoVs without test-time optimization. To perceive humans in varying pixel sizes, we propose an Iterative Ground-aware Cropping to automatically crop the image and then merge the results. To eliminate the influence of the camera and cropping process during the reconstruction, we introduce a canonical Upright 3D Space and the corresponding Upright 2D Space. To link the canonical space and the camera space, we propose the Upright Normalization, which transforms the local crop input into the Upright 2D Space, and transforms the output from the Upright 3D Space into the unified camera space. Besides, we contribute two benchmark datasets, LargeCrowd and SynCrowd, for evaluating crowd reconstruction in large scenes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The source code and data will be publicly available for research purposes.

<title>Forensics Adapter: Unleashing CLIP for Generalizable Face Forgery Detection</title>

Abstract: We describe Forensics Adapter, an adapter network designed to transform CLIP into an effective and generalizable face forgery detector. Although CLIP is highly versatile, adapting it for face forgery detection is non-trivial as forgery-related knowledge is entangled with a wide range of unrelated knowledge. Existing methods treat CLIP merely as a feature extractor, lacking task-specific adaptation, which limits their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce an adapter to learn face forgery traces -- the blending boundaries unique to forged faces, guided by task-specific objectives. Then we enhance the CLIP visual tokens with a dedicated interaction strategy that communicates knowledge across CLIP and the adapter. Since the adapter is alongside CLIP, its versatility is highly retained, naturally ensuring strong generalizability in face forgery detection. With only 5.7M trainable parameters, our method achieves a significant performance boost, improving by approximately 7% on average across five standard datasets. Additionally, we describe Forensics Adapter++, an extended method that incorporates textual modality via a newly proposed forgery-aware prompt learning strategy. This extension leads to a further 1.3% performance boost over the original Forensics Adapter. We believe the proposed methods can serve as a baseline for future CLIP-based face forgery detection methods. The codes have been released at https://github.com/OUC-VAS/ForensicsAdapter.

<title>Defending Multimodal Backdoored Models by Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20392</link>

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning models (e.g., CLIP) can learn high-quality representations from large-scale image-text datasets, while they exhibit significant vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks, raising serious safety concerns. In this paper, we reveal that CLIP's vulnerabilities primarily stem from its tendency to encode features beyond in-dataset predictive patterns, compromising its visual feature resistivity to input perturbations. This makes its encoded features highly susceptible to being reshaped by backdoor triggers. To address this challenge, we propose Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning (RVPT), a novel defense approach that employs deep visual prompt tuning with a specially designed feature-repelling loss. Specifically, RVPT adversarially repels the encoded features from deeper layers while optimizing the standard cross-entropy loss, ensuring that only predictive features in downstream tasks are encoded, thereby enhancing CLIP's visual feature resistivity against input perturbations and mitigating its susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Unlike existing multimodal backdoor defense methods that typically require the availability of poisoned data or involve fine-tuning the entire model, RVPT leverages few-shot downstream clean samples and only tunes a small number of parameters. Empirical results demonstrate that RVPT tunes only 0.27\% of the parameters in CLIP, yet it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods, reducing the attack success rate from 89.70\% to 2.76\% against the most advanced multimodal attacks on ImageNet and effectively generalizes its defensive capabilities across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced image edge detection (ED), primarily through improved feature extraction. However, most existing ED models apply uniform feature fusion across all pixels, ignoring critical differences between regions such as edges and textures. To address this limitation, we propose the Extractor-Selector (E-S) paradigm, a novel framework that introduces pixel-wise feature selection for more adaptive and precise fusion. Unlike conventional image-level fusion that applies the same convolutional kernel to all pixels, our approach dynamically selects relevant features at each pixel, enabling more refined edge predictions. The E-S framework can be seamlessly integrated with existing ED models without architectural changes, delivering substantial performance gains. It can also be combined with enhanced feature extractors for further accuracy improvements. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks confirm that our method consistently outperforms baseline ED models. For instance, on the BIPED2 dataset, the proposed framework can achieve over 7$\%$ improvements in ODS and OIS, and 22$\%$ improvements in AP, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their deployment in safety-critical domains poses significant challenges. Existing safety fine-tuning methods, which focus on textual or multimodal content, fall short in addressing challenging cases or disrupt the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness. Our evaluation highlights a safety reasoning gap: these methods lack safety visual reasoning ability, leading to such bottlenecks. To address this limitation and enhance both visual perception and reasoning in safety-critical contexts, we propose a novel dataset that integrates multi-image inputs with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels as fine-grained reasoning logic to improve model performance. Specifically, we introduce the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, an instruction-following dataset tailored for multi-image safety scenarios, consisting of training and test splits. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B with MIS significantly outperforms both powerful open-source models and API-based models in challenging multi-image tasks requiring safety-related visual reasoning. This approach not only delivers exceptional safety performance but also preserves general capabilities without any trade-offs. Specifically, fine-tuning with MIS increases average accuracy by 0.83% across five general benchmarks and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) on multiple safety benchmarks by a large margin.

Abstract: Guidance techniques are simple yet effective for improving conditional generation in diffusion models. Albeit their empirical success, the practical implementation of guidance diverges significantly from its theoretical motivation. In this paper, we reconcile this discrepancy by replacing the scaled marginal distribution target, which we prove theoretically invalid, with a valid scaled joint distribution objective. Additionally, we show that the established guidance implementations are approximations to the intractable optimal solution under no future foresight constraint. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose rectified gradient guidance (REG), a versatile enhancement designed to boost the performance of existing guidance methods. Experiments on 1D and 2D demonstrate that REG provides a better approximation to the optimal solution than prior guidance techniques, validating the proposed theoretical framework. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation tasks show that incorporating REG consistently improves FID and Inception/CLIP scores across various settings compared to its absence.

Abstract: Recent advances in automotive four-dimensional (4D) Radar have enabled access to raw 4D Radar Tensor (4DRT), offering richer spatial and Doppler information than conventional point clouds. While most existing methods rely on heavily pre-processed, sparse Radar data, recent attempts to leverage raw 4DRT face high computational costs and limited scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) object detection framework that maximizes the utility of 4DRT while preserving efficiency. Our method introduces a multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), where multiple teacher models are trained on point clouds derived from diverse 4DRT pre-processing techniques, each capturing complementary signal characteristics. These teacher representations are fused via a dedicated aggregation module and distilled into a lightweight student model that operates solely on a sparse Radar input. Experimental results on the K-Radar dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of 7.3% in AP_3D and 9.5% in AP_BEV over the baseline RTNH model when using extremely sparse inputs. Furthermore, it attains comparable performance to denser-input baselines while significantly reducing the input data size by about 90 times, confirming the scalability and efficiency of our approach.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have made text-guided image inpainting -- adding, removing, or altering image regions using textual prompts -- widely accessible. However, generating semantically correct photorealistic imagery, typically requires carefully-crafted prompts and iterative refinement by evaluating the realism of the generated content - tasks commonly performed by humans. To automate the generative process, we propose Semantically Aligned and Uncertainty Guided AI Image Inpainting (SAGI), a model-agnostic pipeline, to sample prompts from a distribution that closely aligns with human perception and to evaluate the generated content and discard one that deviates from such a distribution, which we approximate using pretrained Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models. By applying this pipeline on multiple state-of-the-art inpainting models, we create the SAGI Dataset (SAGI-D), currently the largest and most diverse dataset of AI-generated inpaintings, comprising over 95k inpainted images and a human-evaluated subset. Our experiments show that semantic alignment significantly improves image quality and aesthetics, while uncertainty guidance effectively identifies realistic manipulations - human ability to distinguish inpainted images from real ones drops from 74% to 35% in terms of accuracy, after applying our pipeline. Moreover, using SAGI-D for training several image forensic approaches increases in-domain detection performance on average by 37.4% and out-of-domain generalization by 26.1% in terms of IoU, also demonstrating its utility in countering malicious exploitation of generative AI.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown great promise in medical applications, particularly in visual question answering (MedVQA) and diagnosis from medical images. However, existing datasets and models often fail to consider critical aspects of medical diagnostics, such as the integration of historical records and the analysis of disease progression over time. In this paper, we introduce MMXU (Multimodal and MultiX-ray Understanding), a novel dataset for MedVQA that focuses on identifying changes in specific regions between two patient visits. Unlike previous datasets that primarily address single-image questions, MMXU enables multi-image questions, incorporating both current and historical patient data. We demonstrate the limitations of current LVLMs in identifying disease progression on MMXU-\textit{test}, even those that perform well on traditional benchmarks. To address this, we propose a MedRecord-Augmented Generation (MAG) approach, incorporating both global and regional historical records. Our experiments show that integrating historical records significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy by at least 20\%, bridging the gap between current LVLMs and human expert performance. Additionally, we fine-tune models with MAG on MMXU-\textit{dev}, which demonstrates notable improvements. We hope this work could illuminate the avenue of advancing the use of LVLMs in medical diagnostics by emphasizing the importance of historical context in interpreting medical images. Our dataset is released at github: https://github.com/linjiemu/MMXU.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques are essential for improving Earth System Model (ESM) data's spatial resolution, which helps better understand complex environmental processes. This paper presents a new algorithm, ViFOR, which combines Vision Transformers (ViT) and Fourier-based Implicit Neural Representation Networks (INRs) to generate High-Resolution (HR) images from Low-Resolution (LR) inputs. ViFOR introduces a novel integration of Fourier-based activation functions within the Vision Transformer architecture, enabling it to effectively capture global context and high-frequency details critical for accurate SR reconstruction. The results show that ViFOR outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as ViT, Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIREN), and SR Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) based on metrics like Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) both for global as well as the local imagery. ViFOR improves PSNR of up to 4.18 dB, 1.56 dB, and 1.73 dB over ViT for full images in the Source Temperature, Shortwave, and Longwave Flux.

Abstract: We introduce a simple enhancement of vision transformers (ViTs) to improve accuracy while maintaining throughput. Our approach, Jumbo, creates a wider CLS token, which is split to match the patch token width before attention, processed with self-attention, and reassembled. After attention, Jumbo applies a dedicated, wider FFN to this token. Since there is only one Jumbo token, its cost is minimal, and because we share this FFN across layers, its parameter count is controlled. Jumbo significantly improves over ViT+Registers on ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K. These gains are largest at small sizes / high speeds, e.g., ViT-nano+Jumbo outperforms ViT-nano+Registers by 13%. In fact, our Jumbo models are so efficient that they outperform specialized compute-efficient models while preserving the architectural advantages of plain ViTs, such as support for token dropping and other modalities. Accordingly, we demonstrate that Jumbo excels in these two settings via masked autoencoding and on a suite of time series benchmarks. Code and weights available: https://github.com/antofuller/jumbo

Abstract: This paper introduces the Emirates Multi-Task (EMT) dataset, designed to support multi-task benchmarking within a unified framework. It comprises over 30,000 frames from a dash-camera perspective and 570,000 annotated bounding boxes, covering approximately 150 kilometers of driving routes that reflect the distinctive road topology, congestion patterns, and driving behavior of Gulf region traffic. The dataset supports three primary tasks: tracking, trajectory forecasting, and intention prediction. Each benchmark is accompanied by corresponding evaluations: (1) multi-agent tracking experiments addressing multi-class scenarios and occlusion handling; (2) trajectory forecasting evaluation using deep sequential and interaction-aware models; and (3) intention prediction experiments based on observed trajectories. The dataset is publicly available at https://avlab.io/emt-dataset, with pre-processing scripts and evaluation models at https://github.com/AV-Lab/emt-dataset.

Abstract: The adoption of Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radar devices for human sensing, particularly gait recognition, has recently gathered significant attention due to their efficiency, resilience to environmental conditions, and privacy-preserving nature. In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of Open-set Gait Recognition (OSGR) from sparse mmWave radar point clouds. Unlike most existing research, which assumes a closed-set scenario, our work considers the more realistic open-set case, where unknown subjects might be present at inference time, and should be correctly recognized by the system. Point clouds are well-suited for edge computing applications with resource constraints, but are more significantly affected by noise and random fluctuations than other representations, like the more common micro-Doppler signature. This is the first work addressing open-set gait recognition with sparse point cloud data. To do so, we propose a novel neural network architecture that combines supervised classification with unsupervised reconstruction of the point clouds, creating a robust, rich, and highly regularized latent space of gait features. To detect unknown subjects at inference time, we introduce a probabilistic novelty detection algorithm that leverages the structured latent space and offers a tunable trade-off between inference speed and prediction accuracy. Along with this paper, we release mmGait10, an original human gait dataset featuring over five hours of measurements from ten subjects, under varied walking modalities. Extensive experimental results show that our solution attains F1-Score improvements by 24% over state-of-the-art methods, on average, and across multiple openness levels.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is a challenging task in embodied intelligence that requires agents to dynamically explore 3D environments, actively gather visual information, and perform multi-step reasoning to answer questions. However, current EQA approaches suffer from critical limitations in exploration efficiency, dataset design, and evaluation metrics. Moreover, existing datasets often introduce biases or prior knowledge, leading to disembodied reasoning, while frontier-based exploration strategies struggle in cluttered environments and fail to ensure fine-grained exploration of task-relevant areas. To address these challenges, we construct the EXPloration-awaRe Embodied queStion anSwering Benchmark (EXPRESS-Bench), the largest dataset designed specifically to evaluate both exploration and reasoning capabilities. EXPRESS-Bench consists of 777 exploration trajectories and 2,044 question-trajectory pairs. To improve exploration efficiency, we propose Fine-EQA, a hybrid exploration model that integrates frontier-based and goal-oriented navigation to guide agents toward task-relevant regions more effectively. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, Exploration-Answer Consistency (EAC), which ensures faithful assessment by measuring the alignment between answer grounding and exploration reliability. Extensive experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art EQA models demonstrate the effectiveness of our EXPRESS-Bench in advancing embodied exploration and question reasoning.

Abstract: Surround-view perception has garnered significant attention for its ability to enhance the perception capabilities of autonomous driving vehicles through the exchange of information with surrounding cameras. However, existing surround-view perception systems are limited by inefficiencies in unidirectional interaction pattern with human and distortions in overlapping regions exponentially propagating into non-overlapping areas. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ChatStitch, a surround-view human-machine co-perception system capable of unveiling obscured blind spot information through natural language commands integrated with external digital assets. To dismantle the unidirectional interaction bottleneck, ChatStitch implements a cognitively grounded closed-loop interaction multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models. To suppress distortion propagation across overlapping boundaries, ChatStitch proposes SV-UDIS, a surround-view unsupervised deep image stitching method under the non-global-overlapping condition. We conducted extensive experiments on the UDIS-D, MCOV-SLAM open datasets, and our real-world dataset. Specifically, our SV-UDIS method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UDIS-D dataset for 3, 4, and 5 image stitching tasks, with PSNR improvements of 9\%, 17\%, and 21\%, and SSIM improvements of 8\%, 18\%, and 26\%, respectively.

Abstract: Creating accurate and efficient 3D models poses significant challenges, particularly in addressing large viewpoint variations, computational complexity, and alignment discrepancies. Efficient camera path generation can help resolve these issues. In this context, a modified version of the Affine Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (ASIFT) is proposed to extract more matching points with reduced computational overhead, ensuring an adequate number of inliers for precise camera rotation angle estimation. Additionally, a novel two-camera-based rotation correction model is introduced to mitigate small rotational errors, further enhancing accuracy. Furthermore, a stereo camera-based translation estimation and correction model is implemented to determine camera movement in 3D space by altering the Structure From Motion (SFM) model. Finally, the novel combination of ASIFT and two camera-based SFM models provides an accurate camera movement trajectory in 3D space. Experimental results show that the proposed camera movement approach achieves 99.9% accuracy compared to the actual camera movement path and outperforms state-of-the-art camera path estimation methods. By leveraging this accurate camera path, the system facilitates the creation of precise 3D models, making it a robust solution for applications requiring high fidelity and efficiency in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Intraoperative bleeding in laparoscopic surgery causes rapid obscuration of the operative field to hinder the surgical process and increases the risk of postoperative complications. Intelligent detection of bleeding areas can quantify the blood loss to assist decision-making, while locating bleeding points helps surgeons quickly identify the source of bleeding and achieve hemostasis in time to improve surgical success rates. In this study, we first construct a real-world laparoscopic surgical bleeding detection dataset, named SurgBlood, comprising 5,330 frames from 95 surgical video clips with bleeding region and point annotations. Accordingly, we develop a dual-task synergistic online detector called BlooDet, designed to perform simultaneous detection of bleeding regions and points in laparoscopic surgery. Our framework embraces a dual-branch bidirectional guidance design based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2). The mask branch detects bleeding regions through adaptive edge and point prompt embeddings, and the point branch leverages mask memory to induce bleeding point memory modeling and capture the direction of bleed point movement via inter-frame optical flow. By bidirectional guidance, the two branches explore potential spatial-temporal relationships while leveraging memory modeling to infer the current bleeding condition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our baseline outperforms 12 counterparts on SurgBlood in both bleeding region and point detection.

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) focuses on the perceptual visual quality of images, playing a crucial role in downstream tasks such as image reconstruction, compression, and generation. The rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly broadened the scope of IQA, moving toward comprehensive image quality understanding that incorporates content analysis, degradation perception, and comparison reasoning beyond mere numerical scoring. Previous MLLM-based methods typically either generate numerical scores lacking interpretability or heavily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using large-scale annotated datasets to provide descriptive assessments, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this paper, we propose Q-Insight, a reinforcement learning-based model built upon group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which demonstrates strong visual reasoning capability for image quality understanding while requiring only a limited amount of rating scores and degradation labels. By jointly optimizing score regression and degradation perception tasks with carefully designed reward functions, our approach effectively exploits their mutual benefits for enhanced performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Insight substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both score regression and degradation perception tasks, while exhibiting impressive zero-shot generalization to comparison reasoning tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/lwq20020127/Q-Insight.

Abstract: The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.

Abstract: Live tracking of wildlife via high-resolution video processing directly onboard drones is widely unexplored and most existing solutions rely on streaming video to ground stations to support navigation. Yet, both autonomous animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive - a near real-time animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs multi-animal detection and tracking at 17.81fps for HD and 7.53fps on 4K video streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly improve UAV processing speeds. Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200K+ annotated animal instances across 19K+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes, segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT. Our multi-animal tracking experiments with onboard hardware confirm that near real-time high-resolution wildlife tracking is possible on UAVs whilst maintaining high accuracy levels as needed for future navigational and mission-specific animal-centric operational autonomy.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, particularly diffusion models, have significantly lowered the barrier for creating sophisticated forgeries, making image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) increasingly challenging. While prior work in IMDL has focused largely on natural images, the anime domain remains underexplored-despite its growing vulnerability to AI-generated forgeries. Misrepresentations of AI-generated images as hand-drawn artwork, copyright violations, and inappropriate content modifications pose serious threats to the anime community and industry. To address this gap, we propose AnimeDL-2M, the first large-scale benchmark for anime IMDL with comprehensive annotations. It comprises over two million images including real, partially manipulated, and fully AI-generated samples. Experiments indicate that models trained on existing IMDL datasets of natural images perform poorly when applied to anime images, highlighting a clear domain gap between anime and natural images. To better handle IMDL tasks in anime domain, we further propose AniXplore, a novel model tailored to the visual characteristics of anime imagery. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AniXplore achieves superior performance compared to existing methods. Dataset and code can be found in https://flytweety.github.io/AnimeDL2M/.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) shows remarkable potential in medical imaging diagnostics, yet most current models require retraining when applied across different clinical settings, limiting their scalability. We introduce GlobeReady, a clinician-friendly AI platform that enables fundus disease diagnosis that operates without retraining, fine-tuning, or the needs for technical expertise. GlobeReady demonstrates high accuracy across imaging modalities: 93.9-98.5% for 11 fundus diseases using color fundus photographs (CPFs) and 87.2-92.7% for 15 fundus diseases using optic coherence tomography (OCT) scans. By leveraging training-free local feature augmentation, GlobeReady platform effectively mitigates domain shifts across centers and populations, achieving accuracies of 88.9-97.4% across five centers on average in China, 86.3-96.9% in Vietnam, and 73.4-91.0% in Singapore, and 90.2-98.9% in the UK. Incorporating a bulit-in confidence-quantifiable diagnostic mechanism further enhances the platform's accuracy to 94.9-99.4% with CFPs and 88.2-96.2% with OCT, while enabling identification of out-of-distribution cases with 86.3% accuracy across 49 common and rare fundus diseases using CFPs, and 90.6% accuracy across 13 diseases using OCT. Clinicians from countries rated GlobeReady highly for usability and clinical relevance (average score 4.6/5). These findings demonstrate GlobeReady's robustness, generalizability and potential to support global ophthalmic care without technical barriers.

Abstract: The integration of long-context capabilities with visual understanding unlocks unprecedented potential for Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, the quadratic attention complexity during the pre-filling phase remains a significant obstacle to real-world deployment. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MMInference (Multimodality Million tokens Inference), a dynamic sparse attention method that accelerates the prefilling stage for long-context multi-modal inputs. First, our analysis reveals that the temporal and spatial locality of video input leads to a unique sparse pattern, the Grid pattern. Simultaneously, VLMs exhibit markedly different sparse distributions across different modalities. We introduce a permutation-based method to leverage the unique Grid pattern and handle modality boundary issues. By offline search the optimal sparse patterns for each head, MMInference constructs the sparse distribution dynamically based on the input. We also provide optimized GPU kernels for efficient sparse computations. Notably, MMInference integrates seamlessly into existing VLM pipelines without any model modifications or fine-tuning. Experiments on multi-modal benchmarks-including Video QA, Captioning, VisionNIAH, and Mixed-Modality NIAH-with state-of-the-art long-context VLMs (LongVila, LlavaVideo, VideoChat-Flash, Qwen2.5-VL) show that MMInference accelerates the pre-filling stage by up to 8.3x at 1M tokens while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a severe eye condition caused by diabetes where the retinal blood vessels get damaged and can lead to vision loss and blindness if not treated. Early and accurate detection is key to intervention and stopping the disease progressing. For addressing this disease properly, this paper presents a comprehensive approach for automated diabetic retinopathy detection by proposing a new hybrid deep learning model called VR-FuseNet. Diabetic retinopathy is a major eye disease and leading cause of blindness especially among diabetic patients so accurate and efficient automated detection methods are required. To address the limitations of existing methods including dataset imbalance, diversity and generalization issues this paper presents a hybrid dataset created from five publicly available diabetic retinopathy datasets. Essential preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE for class balancing and CLAHE for image enhancement are applied systematically to the dataset to improve the robustness and generalizability of the dataset. The proposed VR-FuseNet model combines the strengths of two state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, VGG19 which captures fine-grained spatial features and ResNet50V2 which is known for its deep hierarchical feature extraction. This fusion improves the diagnostic performance and achieves an accuracy of 91.824%. The model outperforms individual architectures on all performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid feature extraction in Diabetic Retinopathy classification tasks. To make the proposed model more clinically useful and interpretable this paper incorporates multiple XAI techniques. These techniques generate visual explanations that clearly indicate the retinal features affecting the model's prediction such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates so that clinicians can interpret and validate.

Abstract: Synthesizing medical images remains challenging due to limited annotated pathological data, modality domain gaps, and the complexity of representing diffuse pathologies such as liver cirrhosis. Existing methods often struggle to maintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features, frequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient multi-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency Transfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow trajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity, pathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical anatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By reformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr supports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without sacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and CirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Medical Frechet Inception Distance (MFID) of 17.01 for cirrhosis synthesis 28% lower than existing approaches and improving nnUNet segmentation by +3.8% mDSC when used for data augmentation. Radiologist reviews indicate that ViCTr-generated liver cirrhosis MRIs are clinically indistinguishable from real scans. To our knowledge, ViCTr is the first method to provide fine-grained, pathology-aware MRI synthesis with graded severity control, closing a critical gap in AI-driven medical imaging research.

Abstract: As Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are increasingly adopted for diverse downstream tasks and integrated into large vision-language models (VLMs), their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations has emerged as a critical concern. In this work, we introduce \textbf{X-Transfer}, a novel attack method that exposes a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP. X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of deceiving various CLIP encoders and downstream VLMs across different samples, tasks, and domains. We refer to this property as \textbf{super transferability}--a single perturbation achieving cross-data, cross-domain, cross-model, and cross-task adversarial transferability simultaneously. This is achieved through \textbf{surrogate scaling}, a key innovation of our approach. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed surrogate models, which are computationally intensive to scale, X-Transfer employs an efficient surrogate scaling strategy that dynamically selects a small subset of suitable surrogates from a large search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that X-Transfer significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art UAP methods, establishing a new benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/HanxunH/XTransferBench}{GitHub repository}.

Abstract: Recent advancements have enhanced the capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to comprehend multi-image information. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is critical in both civilian and military applications. However, the limited texture and structural information in infrared images makes accurate detection particularly challenging. Although recent deep learning-based methods have improved performance, their use of conventional convolution kernels limits adaptability to complex scenes and diverse targets. Moreover, pooling operations often cause feature loss and insufficient exploitation of image information. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive receptive field convolution and wavelet-attentive hierarchical network for infrared small target detection (ARFC-WAHNet). This network incorporates a multi-receptive field feature interaction convolution (MRFFIConv) module to adaptively extract discriminative features by integrating multiple convolutional branches with a gated unit. A wavelet frequency enhancement downsampling (WFED) module leverages Haar wavelet transform and frequency-domain reconstruction to enhance target features and suppress background noise. Additionally, we introduce a high-low feature fusion (HLFF) module for integrating low-level details with high-level semantics, and a global median enhancement attention (GMEA) module to improve feature diversity and expressiveness via global attention. Experiments on public datasets SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k demonstrate that ARFC-WAHNet outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in both detection accuracy and robustness, particularly under complex backgrounds. The code is available at https://github.com/Leaf2001/ARFC-WAHNet.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) now excel on many vision language benchmarks, however, they still struggle with human centered criteria such as fairness, ethics, empathy, and inclusivity, key to aligning with human values. We introduce HumaniBench, a holistic benchmark of 32K real-world image question pairs, annotated via a scalable GPT4o assisted pipeline and exhaustively verified by domain experts. HumaniBench evaluates seven Human Centered AI (HCAI) principles: fairness, ethics, understanding, reasoning, language inclusivity, empathy, and robustness, across seven diverse tasks, including open and closed ended visual question answering (VQA), multilingual QA, visual grounding, empathetic captioning, and robustness tests. Benchmarking 15 state of the art LMMs (open and closed source) reveals that proprietary models generally lead, though robustness and visual grounding remain weak points. Some open-source models also struggle to balance accuracy with adherence to human-aligned principles. HumaniBench is the first benchmark purpose built around HCAI principles. It provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing alignment gaps and guiding LMMs toward behavior that is both accurate and socially responsible.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.

<title>A Comprehensive Assessment Benchmark for Rigorously Evaluating Deep Learning Image Classifiers</title>

Abstract: Reliable and robust evaluation methods are a necessary first step towards developing machine learning models that are themselves robust and reliable. Unfortunately, current evaluation protocols typically used to assess classifiers fail to comprehensively evaluate performance as they tend to rely on limited types of test data, and ignore others. For example, using the standard test data fails to evaluate the predictions made by the classifier to samples from classes it was not trained on. On the other hand, testing with data containing samples from unknown classes fails to evaluate how well the classifier can predict the labels for known classes. This article advocates benchmarking performance using a wide range of different types of data and using a single metric that can be applied to all such data types to produce a consistent evaluation of performance. Using the proposed benchmark it is found that current deep neural networks, including those trained with methods that are believed to produce state-of-the-art robustness, are vulnerable to making mistakes on certain types of data. This means that such models will be unreliable in real-world scenarios where they may encounter data from many different domains, and that they are insecure as they can be easily fooled into making the wrong decisions. It is hoped that these results will motivate the wider adoption of more comprehensive testing methods that will, in turn, lead to the development of more robust machine learning methods in the future.

<title>Quantifying Statistical Significance in Diffusion-Based Anomaly Localization via Selective Inference</title>

Abstract: Anomaly localization in images (identifying regions that deviate from expected patterns) is vital in applications such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. A recent trend is the use of image generation models in anomaly localization, where these models generate normal-looking counterparts of anomalous images, thereby allowing flexible and adaptive anomaly localization. However, these methods inherit the uncertainty and bias implicitly embedded in the employed generative model, raising concerns about the reliability. To address this, we propose a statistical framework based on selective inference to quantify the significance of detected anomalous regions. Our method provides $p$-values to assess the false positive detection rates, providing a principled measure of reliability. As a proof of concept, we consider anomaly localization using a diffusion model and its applications to medical diagnoses and industrial inspections. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively controls the risk of false positive detection, supporting its use in high-stakes decision-making tasks.

<title>Explaining Black-box Model Predictions via Two-level Nested Feature Attributions with Consistency Property</title>

Abstract: Techniques that explain the predictions of black-box machine learning models are crucial to make the models transparent, thereby increasing trust in AI systems. The input features to the models often have a nested structure that consists of high- and low-level features, and each high-level feature is decomposed into multiple low-level features. For such inputs, both high-level feature attributions (HiFAs) and low-level feature attributions (LoFAs) are important for better understanding the model's decision. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic local explanation method that effectively exploits the nested structure of the input to estimate the two-level feature attributions simultaneously. A key idea of the proposed method is to introduce the consistency property that should exist between the HiFAs and LoFAs, thereby bridging the separate optimization problems for estimating them. Thanks to this consistency property, the proposed method can produce HiFAs and LoFAs that are both faithful to the black-box models and consistent with each other, using a smaller number of queries to the models. In experiments on image classification in multiple instance learning and text classification using language models, we demonstrate that the HiFAs and LoFAs estimated by the proposed method are accurate, faithful to the behaviors of the black-box models, and provide consistent explanations.

Abstract: Analyzing the similarity of internal representations has been an important technique for understanding the behavior of deep neural networks. Most existing methods for analyzing the similarity between representations of high dimensions, such as those based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), rely on statistical properties of the representations for a set of data points. In this paper, we focus on transformer models and study the similarity of representations between the hidden layers of individual transformers. In this context, we show that a simple sample-wise cosine similarity metric is capable of capturing the similarity and aligns with the complicated CKA. Our experimental results on common transformers reveal that representations across layers are positively correlated, with similarity increasing when layers get closer. We provide a theoretical justification for this phenomenon under the geodesic curve assumption for the learned transformer. We then show that an increase in representation similarity implies an increase in predicted probability when directly applying the last-layer classifier to any hidden layer representation. We then propose an aligned training method to improve the effectiveness of shallow layer by enhancing the similarity between internal representations, with trained models that enjoy the following properties: (1) more early saturation events, (2) layer-wise accuracies monotonically increase and reveal the minimal depth needed for the given task, (3) when served as multi-exit models, they achieve on-par performance with standard multi-exit architectures which consist of additional classifiers designed for early exiting in shallow layers. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show that one common classifier is sufficient for multi-exit models. We conduct experiments on both vision and NLP tasks to demonstrate the performance of the proposed aligned training.

<title>Erasing Undesirable Concepts in Diffusion Models with Adversarial Preservation</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating visually striking content from text but can inadvertently produce undesirable or harmful content when trained on unfiltered internet data. A practical solution is to selectively removing target concepts from the model, but this may impact the remaining concepts. Prior approaches have tried to balance this by introducing a loss term to preserve neutral content or a regularization term to minimize changes in the model parameters, yet resolving this trade-off remains challenging. In this work, we propose to identify and preserving concepts most affected by parameter changes, termed as \textit{adversarial concepts}. This approach ensures stable erasure with minimal impact on the other concepts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the Stable Diffusion model, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods in eliminating unwanted content while maintaining the integrity of other unrelated elements. Our code is available at https://github.com/tuananhbui89/Erasing-Adversarial-Preservation.

<title>DiffBreak: Is Diffusion-Based Purification Robust?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2411.16598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) has become a cornerstone defense against adversarial examples (AEs), regarded as robust due to its use of diffusion models (DMs) that project AEs onto the natural data manifold. We refute this core claim, theoretically proving that gradient-based attacks effectively target the DM rather than the classifier, causing DBP's outputs to align with adversarial distributions. This prompts a reassessment of DBP's robustness, attributing it to two critical flaws: incorrect gradients and inappropriate evaluation protocols that test only a single random purification of the AE. We show that with proper accounting for stochasticity and resubmission risk, DBP collapses. To support this, we introduce DiffBreak, the first reliable toolkit for differentiation through DBP, eliminating gradient flaws that previously further inflated robustness estimates. We also analyze the current defense scheme used for DBP where classification relies on a single purification, pinpointing its inherent invalidity. We provide a statistically grounded majority-vote (MV) alternative that aggregates predictions across multiple purified copies, showing partial but meaningful robustness gain. We then propose a novel adaptation of an optimization method against deepfake watermarking, crafting systemic perturbations that defeat DBP even under MV, challenging DBP's viability.

Abstract: The persisting threats on migratory bird populations highlight the urgent need for effective monitoring techniques that could assist in their conservation. Among these, passive acoustic monitoring is an essential tool, particularly for nocturnal migratory species that are difficult to track otherwise. This work presents the Nocturnal Bird Migration (NBM) dataset, a collection of 13,359 annotated vocalizations from 117 species of the Western Palearctic. The dataset includes precise time and frequency annotations, gathered by dozens of bird enthusiasts across France, enabling novel downstream acoustic analysis. In particular, we prove the utility of this database by training an original two-stage deep object detection model tailored for the processing of audio data. While allowing the precise localization of bird calls in spectrograms, this model shows competitive accuracy on the 45 main species of the dataset with state-of-the-art systems trained on much larger audio collections. These results highlight the interest of fostering similar open-science initiatives to acquire costly but valuable fine-grained annotations of audio files. All data and code are made openly available.

Abstract: Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk of harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the concept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one concept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric properties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is confined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) method, which \emph{dynamically} selects optimal target concepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side effects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while maintaining effective erasure performance. Our code is published at {https://github.com/tuananhbui89/Adaptive-Guided-Erasure}.

Abstract: High-resolution whole-brain in vivo MR imaging at mesoscale resolutions remains challenging due to long scan durations, motion artifacts, and limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study proposes Rotating-view super-resolution (ROVER)-MRI, an unsupervised framework based on multi-scale implicit neural representations (INR), enabling efficient recovery of fine anatomical details from multi-view thick-slice acquisitions. ROVER-MRI employs coordinate-based neural networks to implicitly and continuously encode image structures at multiple spatial scales, simultaneously modeling anatomical continuity and correcting inter-view motion through an integrated registration mechanism. Validation on ex-vivo monkey brain data and multiple in-vivo human datasets demonstrates substantially improved reconstruction performance compared to bicubic interpolation and state-of-the-art regularized least-squares super-resolution reconstruction (LS-SRR) with 2-fold reduction in scan time. Notably, ROVER-MRI achieves an unprecedented whole-brain in-vivo T2-weighted imaging at 180 micron isotropic resolution in only 17 minutes of scan time on a 7T scanner with 22.4% lower relative error compared to LS-SRR. We also demonstrate improved SNR using ROVER-MRI compared to a time-matched 3D GRE acquisition. Quantitative results on several datasets demonstrate better sharpness of the reconstructed images with ROVER-MRI for different super-resolution factors (5 to 11). These findings highlight ROVER-MRI's potential as a rapid, accurate, and motion-resilient mesoscale imaging solution, promising substantial advantages for neuroimaging studies.

<title>CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering</title>

arXiv:2505.01476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

Abstract: Dynamic scene representation and reconstruction have undergone transformative advances in recent years, catalyzed by breakthroughs in neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. While initially developed for static environments, these methodologies have rapidly evolved to address the complexities inherent in 4D dynamic scenes through an expansive body of research. Coupled with innovations in differentiable volumetric rendering, these approaches have significantly enhanced the quality of motion representation and dynamic scene reconstruction, thereby garnering substantial attention from the computer vision and graphics communities. This survey presents a systematic analysis of over 200 papers focused on dynamic scene representation using radiance field, spanning the spectrum from implicit neural representations to explicit Gaussian primitives. We categorize and evaluate these works through multiple critical lenses: motion representation paradigms, reconstruction techniques for varied scene dynamics, auxiliary information integration strategies, and regularization approaches that ensure temporal consistency and physical plausibility. We organize diverse methodological approaches under a unified representational framework, concluding with a critical examination of persistent challenges and promising research directions. By providing this comprehensive overview, we aim to establish a definitive reference for researchers entering this rapidly evolving field while offering experienced practitioners a systematic understanding of both conceptual principles and practical frontiers in dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Video surveillance image analysis and processing is a challenging field in computer vision, with one of its most difficult tasks being Person Re-Identification (PRe-ID). PRe-ID aims to identify and track target individuals who have already been detected in a network of cameras, using a robust description of their pedestrian images. The success of recent research in person PRe-ID is largely due to effective feature extraction and representation, as well as the powerful learning of these features to reliably discriminate between pedestrian images. To this end, two powerful features, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), are modeled on multidimensional data using the proposed method, High-Dimensional Feature Fusion (HDFF). Specifically, a new tensor fusion scheme is introduced to leverage and combine these two types of features in a single tensor, even though their dimensions are not identical. To enhance the system's accuracy, we employ Tensor Cross-View Quadratic Analysis (TXQDA) for multilinear subspace learning, followed by cosine similarity for matching. TXQDA efficiently facilitates learning while reducing the high dimensionality inherent in high-order tensor data. The effectiveness of our approach is verified through experiments on three widely-used PRe-ID datasets: VIPeR, GRID, and PRID450S. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), a gap remains, particularly regarding their interpretability and how they locate and interpret textual information within images. In this paper, we explore various LVLMs to identify the specific heads responsible for recognizing text from images, which we term the Optical Character Recognition Head (OCR Head). Our findings regarding these heads are as follows: (1) Less Sparse: Unlike previous retrieval heads, a large number of heads are activated to extract textual information from images. (2) Qualitatively Distinct: OCR heads possess properties that differ significantly from general retrieval heads, exhibiting low similarity in their characteristics. (3) Statically Activated: The frequency of activation for these heads closely aligns with their OCR scores. We validate our findings in downstream tasks by applying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to both OCR and conventional retrieval heads and by masking these heads. We also demonstrate that redistributing sink-token values within the OCR heads improves performance. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the internal mechanisms LVLMs employ in processing embedded textual information in images.

Abstract: Despite the dominance of convolutional and transformer-based architectures in image-to-image retrieval, these models are prone to biases arising from low-level visual features, such as color. Recognizing the lack of semantic understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity, replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in counterfactual image retrieval.

Abstract: Commuting Origin-destination~(OD) flows, capturing daily population mobility of citizens, are vital for sustainable development across cities around the world. However, it is challenging to obtain the data due to the high cost of travel surveys and privacy concerns. Surprisingly, we find that satellite imagery, publicly available across the globe, contains rich urban semantic signals to support high-quality OD flow generation, with over 98\% expressiveness of traditional multisource hard-to-collect urban sociodemographic, economics, land use, and point of interest data. This inspires us to design a novel data generator, GlODGen, which can generate OD flow data for any cities of interest around the world. Specifically, GlODGen first leverages Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Models to extract urban semantic signals related to human mobility from satellite imagery. These features are then combined with population data to form region-level representations, which are used to generate OD flows via graph diffusion models. Extensive experiments on 4 continents and 6 representative cities show that GlODGen has great generalizability across diverse urban environments on different continents and can generate OD flow data for global cities highly consistent with real-world mobility data. We implement GlODGen as an automated tool, seamlessly integrating data acquisition and curation, urban semantic feature extraction, and OD flow generation together. It has been released at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/generate-od-pubtools.

<div> Keywords: model merging, LoRA, parameter magnitude variance, DO-Merging, orthogonal constraints

Summary: 
Existing research on model merging has primarily focused on full fine-tuning models, neglecting the popular LoRA approach. However, empirical analysis shows that current merging methods are ineffective on LoRA due to large parameter magnitude variances causing information loss during merging. To address this issue, a Decoupled and Orthogonal (DO-Merging) approach is proposed, separating parameters into magnitude and direction components to preserve task information. A data-free, layer-wise gradient descent method with orthogonal constraints is introduced to mitigate interference during merging. Theoretical guarantees are provided for both decoupling and orthogonal components. Extensive experiments across various domains demonstrate that DO-Merging outperforms existing methods at a minimal cost, offering significant performance improvements across tasks. <div>

Abstract: With more open-source models available for diverse tasks, model merging has gained attention by combining models into one, reducing training, storage, and inference costs. Current research mainly focuses on model merging for full fine-tuning, overlooking the popular LoRA. However, our empirical analysis reveals that: a) existing merging methods designed for full fine-tuning perform poorly on LoRA; b) LoRA modules show much larger parameter magnitude variance than full fine-tuned weights; c) greater parameter magnitude variance correlates with worse merging performance. Considering that large magnitude variances cause deviations in the distribution of the merged parameters, resulting in information loss and performance degradation, we propose a Decoupled and Orthogonal merging approach(DO-Merging). By separating parameters into magnitude and direction components and merging them independently, we reduce the impact of magnitude differences on the directional alignment of the merged models, thereby preserving task information. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free, layer-wise gradient descent method with orthogonal constraints to mitigate interference during the merging of direction components. We provide theoretical guarantees for both the decoupling and orthogonal components. And we validate through extensive experiments across vision, language, and multi-modal domains that our proposed DO-Merging can achieve significantly higher performance than existing merging methods at a minimal cost. Notably, each component can be flexibly integrated with existing methods, offering near free-lunch improvements across tasks.

<title>Highlighting What Matters: Promptable Embeddings for Attribute-Focused Image Retrieval</title>

<div> Keywords: Text-to-image retrievers, Visual attributes, COCO-Facet benchmark, Promptable image embeddings, Acceleration strategies <br />
Summary: 
The study introduces a new benchmark called COCO-Facet that evaluates text-to-image retrievers' performance on attribute-focused queries. It discovers that current CLIP-like retrievers struggle with attribute-focused queries due to focusing on global semantics and subjects. Even stronger Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based retrievers face limitations in addressing attribute-focused queries. The study proposes using promptable image embeddings to enhance retrieval performance by highlighting required attributes. The proposed pipeline for deriving promptable embeddings is versatile across query types, image pools, and retriever architectures. Acceleration strategies, such as pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations, are offered to improve retrieval efficiency. Predefined prompts result in a 15% improvement in Recall@5, while prompts available during inference achieve an 8% improvement. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.15877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Visual Reasoning, Grounded Reasoning, MLLMs, Data efficiency

Summary: 
Grounded Reasoning with Images and Texts (GRIT) introduces a novel method for training MLLMs to reason with images. The approach integrates natural language and bounding box coordinates to create visually grounded reasoning chains. GRIT utilizes a reinforcement learning approach, GRPO-GR, focused on final answer accuracy and reasoning output format, requiring minimal training data. This data efficiency is achieved through robust rewards and does not rely on explicit annotations. GRIT successfully trains MLLMs to produce coherent and visually grounded reasoning chains, demonstrating a fusion of reasoning and grounding abilities. <div>
arXiv:2505.15879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in building reasoning models that articulate chains of thoughts prior to producing final answers. However, despite ongoing advances that aim at enabling reasoning for vision-language tasks, existing open-source visual reasoning models typically generate reasoning content with pure natural language, lacking explicit integration of visual information. This limits their ability to produce clearly articulated and visually grounded reasoning chains. To this end, we propose Grounded Reasoning with Images and Texts (GRIT), a novel method for training MLLMs to think with images. GRIT introduces a grounded reasoning paradigm, in which models generate reasoning chains that interleave natural language and explicit bounding box coordinates. These coordinates point to regions of the input image that the model consults during its reasoning process. Additionally, GRIT is equipped with a reinforcement learning approach, GRPO-GR, built upon the GRPO algorithm. GRPO-GR employs robust rewards focused on the final answer accuracy and format of the grounded reasoning output, which eliminates the need for data with reasoning chain annotations or explicit bounding box labels. As a result, GRIT achieves exceptional data efficiency, requiring as few as 20 image-question-answer triplets from existing datasets. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that GRIT effectively trains MLLMs to produce coherent and visually grounded reasoning chains, showing a successful unification of reasoning and grounding abilities.

<div> physics-aware, adversarial driving scenarios, autonomous driving systems, realistic sensor data, Challenger framework

Summary:
The article introduces the Challenger framework, designed to generate photorealistic adversarial driving scenarios that stress-test autonomous driving systems. The framework utilizes a physics-aware multi-round trajectory refinement process to narrow down candidate adversarial maneuvers and a tailored trajectory scoring function to encourage realistic yet adversarial behavior. Challenger can produce a diverse range of aggressive driving scenarios, such as cut-ins, sudden lane changes, tailgating, and blind spot intrusions, and render them into multiview photorealistic videos. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that these scenarios significantly increase the collision rate of state-of-the-art end-to-end AD models (UniAD, VAD, SparseDrive, and DiffusionDrive), with adversarial behaviors transferring across different models. The framework's ability to generate realistic sensor data enhances its effectiveness in stress-testing autonomous driving systems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.15880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating photorealistic driving videos has seen significant progress recently, but current methods largely focus on ordinary, non-adversarial scenarios. Meanwhile, efforts to generate adversarial driving scenarios often operate on abstract trajectory or BEV representations, falling short of delivering realistic sensor data that can truly stress-test autonomous driving (AD) systems. In this work, we introduce Challenger, a framework that produces physically plausible yet photorealistic adversarial driving videos. Generating such videos poses a fundamental challenge: it requires jointly optimizing over the space of traffic interactions and high-fidelity sensor observations. Challenger makes this affordable through two techniques: (1) a physics-aware multi-round trajectory refinement process that narrows down candidate adversarial maneuvers, and (2) a tailored trajectory scoring function that encourages realistic yet adversarial behavior while maintaining compatibility with downstream video synthesis. As tested on the nuScenes dataset, Challenger generates a diverse range of aggressive driving scenarios-including cut-ins, sudden lane changes, tailgating, and blind spot intrusions-and renders them into multiview photorealistic videos. Extensive evaluations show that these scenarios significantly increase the collision rate of state-of-the-art end-to-end AD models (UniAD, VAD, SparseDrive, and DiffusionDrive), and importantly, adversarial behaviors discovered for one model often transfer to others.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Video Question Answering (VideoQA) have introduced LLM-based agents, modular frameworks, and procedural solutions, yielding promising results. These systems use dynamic agents and memory-based mechanisms to break down complex tasks and refine answers. However, significant improvements remain in tracking objects for grounding over time and decision-making based on reasoning to better align object references with language model outputs, as newer models get better at both tasks. This work presents an LLM-brained agent for zero-shot Video Question Answering (VideoQA) that combines a Chain-of-Thought framework with grounding reasoning alongside YOLO-World to enhance object tracking and alignment. This approach establishes a new state-of-the-art in VideoQA and Video Understanding, showing enhanced performance on NExT-QA, iVQA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. Our framework also enables cross-checking of grounding timeframes, improving accuracy and providing valuable support for verification and increased output reliability across multiple video domains.

Abstract: With video games now generating the highest revenues in the entertainment industry, optimizing game development workflows has become essential for the sector's sustained growth. Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer considerable potential to automate and enhance various aspects of game development, particularly Quality Assurance (QA), which remains one of the industry's most labor-intensive processes with limited automation options. To accurately evaluate the performance of VLMs in video game QA tasks and determine their effectiveness in handling real-world scenarios, there is a clear need for standardized benchmarks, as existing benchmarks are insufficient to address the specific requirements of this domain.

<div> motion blur, super-resolution, imaging constraints, reconstruction-based methods, convex optimization 

Summary:
This article explores the boundaries of super-resolution using imaging constraints. Traditional reconstruction-based methods have been limited in their ability to increase resolution due to various constraints. By incorporating high-precision motion information, sparse image priors, and utilizing convex optimization techniques, it becomes feasible to achieve significant resolution enhancements. The study highlights the importance of deconvolution with a box in the super-resolution process, demonstrating perfect reconstructions of sparse signals can be achieved through convex optimization. Surprisingly, the research also reveals that motion blur can actually aid in super-resolution, as shown through experiments using pseudo-random motion to reconstruct high-resolution targets from single low-resolution images. Both simulated data and real data from a camera mounted on a computer-controlled stage reinforce the effectiveness of these techniques in achieving impressive resolution improvements. <div>
arXiv:2505.15961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the limits of super-resolution using imaging constraints. Due to various theoretical and practical limitations, reconstruction-based methods have been largely restricted to small increases in resolution. In addition, motion-blur is usually seen as a nuisance that impedes super-resolution. We show that by using high-precision motion information, sparse image priors, and convex optimization, it is possible to increase resolution by large factors. A key operation in super-resolution is deconvolution with a box. In general, convolution with a box is not invertible. However, we obtain perfect reconstructions of sparse signals using convex optimization. We also show that motion blur can be helpful for super-resolution. We demonstrate that using pseudo-random motion it is possible to reconstruct a high-resolution target using a single low-resolution image. We present numerical experiments with simulated data and results with real data captured by a camera mounted on a computer controlled stage.

<br />
Summary:
<br />
The paper introduces a new framework called Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP) to address the issue of hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs). These models often generate content that does not align with visual inputs. OViP dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the model's own hallucinated outputs, generating more relevant supervision signals in real-time. By identifying semantic differences between sampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion model, OViP enables adaptive alignment of textual and visual preferences. The framework allows for failure-driven training, effectively reducing hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal capabilities. The paper also refines evaluation protocols to better assess the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness. Experimental results on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of OViP in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs.

arXiv:2505.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucination, often generating content misaligned with visual inputs. While recent approaches advance multi-modal Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate hallucination, they typically rely on predefined or randomly edited negative samples that fail to reflect actual model errors, limiting training efficacy. In this work, we propose an Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP) framework that dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the model's own hallucinated outputs. By identifying semantic differences between sampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion model, OViP generates more relevant supervision signals in real time. This failure-driven training enables adaptive alignment of both textual and visual preferences. Moreover, we refine existing evaluation protocols to better capture the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness. Experiments on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate that OViP effectively reduces hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal capabilities.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). They equip VLMs with visual reasoning operations like zoom-in and select-frame to enhance reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. To address challenges such as model competence imbalance and reluctance to adopt pixel-space operations, a two-phase training approach is utilized. The first phase involves instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces, while the second phase utilizes reinforcement learning with a curiosity-driven reward scheme. These visual operations enable VLMs to interact with complex visual inputs, leading to improved performance on visual reasoning benchmarks. The authors' 7B model, \model, achieves high accuracy on various benchmarks, underscoring the importance and effectiveness of pixel-space reasoning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

Summary: 
This study delves into how deep vision models encode the ImageNet hierarchy using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). By analyzing the internal representations of vision models, the researchers found that SAEs reveal hierarchical relationships in the model activations. This implies that deep vision models implicitly encode taxonomic structure defined by the ImageNet taxonomy. The study focused on the popular vision foundation model DINOv2 and examined the consistency of hierarchical representations across different layers. The analysis showed that deep vision models internalize hierarchical category information by enhancing information in the class token through each layer. The results highlight the potential of SAEs as a valuable tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks, providing a systematic framework for hierarchical analysis of vision model representations. <div>

Abstract: The ImageNet hierarchy provides a structured taxonomy of object categories, offering a valuable lens through which to analyze the representations learned by deep vision models. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how vision models encode the ImageNet hierarchy, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to probe their internal representations. SAEs have been widely used as an explanation tool for large language models (LLMs), where they enable the discovery of semantically meaningful features. Here, we extend their use to vision models to investigate whether learned representations align with the ontological structure defined by the ImageNet taxonomy. Our results show that SAEs uncover hierarchical relationships in model activations, revealing an implicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these representations across different layers of the popular vision foundation model DINOv2 and provide insights into how deep vision models internalize hierarchical category information by increasing information in the class token through each layer. Our study establishes a framework for systematic hierarchical analysis of vision model representations and highlights the potential of SAEs as a tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks.

Abstract: Exploring the trustworthiness of deep learning models is crucial, especially in critical domains such as medical imaging decision support systems. Conformal prediction has emerged as a rigorous means of providing deep learning models with reliable uncertainty estimates and safety guarantees. However, conformal prediction results face challenges due to the backbone model's struggles in domain-shifted scenarios, such as variations in different sources. To aim this challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework termed Conformal Ensemble of Vision Transformers (CE-ViTs) designed to enhance image classification performance by prioritizing domain adaptation and model robustness, while accounting for uncertainty. The proposed method leverages an ensemble of vision transformer models in the backbone, trained on diverse datasets including HAM10000, Dermofit, and Skin Cancer ISIC datasets. This ensemble learning approach, calibrated through the combined mentioned datasets, aims to enhance domain adaptation through conformal learning. Experimental results underscore that the framework achieves a high coverage rate of 90.38\%, representing an improvement of 9.95\% compared to the HAM10000 model. This indicates a strong likelihood that the prediction set includes the true label compared to singular models. Ensemble learning in CE-ViTs significantly improves conformal prediction performance, increasing the average prediction set size for challenging misclassified samples from 1.86 to 3.075.

This paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation using Diffusion Transformers (DiT) that incorporate the denoising capabilities of diffusion models and the global modeling power of transformers. The model is conditioned on image embeddings from a pre-trained CLIP encoder to guide the translation process without the need for text or class labels.

Abstract: Image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping between a source and a target domain, enabling tasks such as style transfer, appearance transformation, and domain adaptation. In this work, we explore a diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation by adapting Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which combine the denoising capabilities of diffusion models with the global modeling power of transformers. To guide the translation process, we condition the model on image embeddings extracted from a pre-trained CLIP encoder, allowing for fine-grained and structurally consistent translations without relying on text or class labels. We incorporate both a CLIP similarity loss to enforce semantic consistency and an LPIPS perceptual loss to enhance visual fidelity during training. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: face2comics, which translates real human faces to comic-style illustrations, and edges2shoes, which translates edge maps to realistic shoe images. Experimental results demonstrate that DiT, combined with CLIP-based conditioning and perceptual similarity objectives, achieves high-quality, semantically faithful translations, offering a promising alternative to GAN-based models for paired image-to-image translation tasks.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the image processing community should broaden its focus from purely model-centric development to include agentic system design as an essential complementary paradigm. While deep learning has significantly advanced capabilities for specific image processing tasks, current approaches face critical limitations in generalization, adaptability, and real-world problem-solving flexibility. We propose that developing intelligent agentic systems, capable of dynamically selecting, combining, and optimizing existing image processing tools, represents the next evolutionary step for the field. Such systems would emulate human experts' ability to strategically orchestrate different tools to solve complex problems, overcoming the brittleness of monolithic models. The paper analyzes key limitations of model-centric paradigms, establishes design principles for agentic image processing systems, and outlines different capability levels for such agents.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a challenging research topic with broad applications. Effective VQA necessitates sensitivity to pixel-level distortions and a comprehensive understanding of video context to accurately determine the perceptual impact of distortions. Traditional hand-crafted and learning-based VQA models mainly focus on pixel-level distortions and lack contextual understanding, while recent LLM-based models struggle with sensitivity to small distortions or handle quality scoring and description as separate tasks. To address these shortcomings, we introduce CP-LLM: a Context and Pixel aware Large Language Model. CP-LLM is a novel multimodal LLM architecture featuring dual vision encoders designed to independently analyze perceptual quality at both high-level (video context) and low-level (pixel distortion) granularity, along with a language decoder subsequently reasons about the interplay between these aspects. This design enables CP-LLM to simultaneously produce robust quality scores and interpretable quality descriptions, with enhanced sensitivity to pixel distortions (e.g. compression artifacts). The model is trained via a multi-task pipeline optimizing for score prediction, description generation, and pairwise comparisons. Experiment results demonstrate that CP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset performance on established VQA benchmarks and superior robustness to pixel distortions, confirming its efficacy for comprehensive and practical video quality assessment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Perceiving pedestrians in highly crowded urban environments is a difficult long-tail problem for learning-based autonomous perception. Speeding up 3D ground truth generation for such challenging scenes is performance-critical yet very challenging. The difficulties include the sparsity of the captured pedestrian point cloud and a lack of suitable benchmarks for a specific system design study. To tackle the challenges, we first collect a new multi-view LiDAR-camera 3D multiple-object-tracking benchmark of highly crowded pedestrians for in-depth analysis. We then build an offboard auto-labeling system that reconstructs pedestrian trajectories from LiDAR point cloud and multi-view images. To improve the generalization power for crowded scenes and the performance for small objects, we propose to learn high-resolution representations that are density-aware and relationship-aware. Extensive experiments validate that our approach significantly improves the 3D pedestrian tracking performance towards higher auto-labeling efficiency. The code will be publicly available at this HTTP URL.

Summary:<br />
GMatch is a learning-free feature matcher that addresses local ambiguities in sparse feature matching for robust 6DoF object pose estimation. It utilizes a guided, incremental search approach to ensure SE(3)-invariant geometric consistency throughout the matching process. GMatch leverages a complete set of geometric features to determine 3D keypoint configurations globally and consistently without requiring training or GPU support. When combined with classical descriptors like SIFT, GMatch-SIFT offers a general-purpose pose estimation pipeline with strong interpretability and generalization capabilities. Experimental results on the HOPE dataset demonstrate that GMatch surpasses traditional and learning-based matchers, with GMatch-SIFT achieving performance on par with instance-level pose networks. On the YCB-Video dataset, GMatch-SIFT shows high accuracy and low variance for texture-rich objects. These findings validate the effectiveness of GMatch-SIFT for object pose estimation and highlight the broad applicability of GMatch as a versatile feature matcher. Code for GMatch will be made available upon acceptance. <div>

Abstract: We present GMatch, a learning-free feature matcher designed for robust 6DoF object pose estimation, addressing common local ambiguities in sparse feature matching. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on descriptor similarity, GMatch performs a guided, incremental search, enforcing SE(3)-invariant geometric consistency throughout the matching process. It leverages a provably complete set of geometric features that uniquely determine 3D keypoint configurations, ensuring globally consistent correspondences without the need for training or GPU support. When combined with classical descriptors such as SIFT, GMatch-SIFT forms a general-purpose pose estimation pipeline that offers strong interpretability and generalization across diverse objects and scenes. Experiments on the HOPE dataset show that GMatch outperforms both traditional and learning-based matchers, with GMatch-SIFT achieving or surpassing the performance of instance-level pose networks. On the YCB-Video dataset, GMatch-SIFT demonstrates high accuracy and low variance on texture-rich objects. These results not only validate the effectiveness of GMatch-SIFT for object pose estimation but also highlight the broader applicability of GMatch as a general-purpose feature matcher.

<div> LVLMs, vision-language models, hallucinations, sparse autoencoders, SSL <br />
Summary: 
Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved high performance on tasks like visual question answering and image captioning but suffer from hallucinations, generating incorrect textual descriptions. Existing methods to address this issue are computationally expensive. This study proposes using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify semantic directions linked to hallucinations or reality, allowing for targeted interventions. Interventions along identified directions can either mitigate or exacerbate hallucinations. The proposed approach, Steering LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), is a training-free method that effectively mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs without increasing computational overhead. Experimental results show that SSL outperforms existing approaches in reducing hallucinations while maintaining transferability across different model architectures. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on multimodal tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning. However, they still suffer from hallucinations, generating text inconsistent with visual input, posing significant risks in real-world applications. Existing approaches to address this issue focus on incorporating external knowledge bases, alignment training, or decoding strategies, all of which require substantial computational cost and time. Recent works try to explore more efficient alternatives by adjusting LVLMs' internal representations. Although promising, these methods may cause hallucinations to be insufficiently suppressed or lead to excessive interventions that negatively affect normal semantics. In this work, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify semantic directions closely associated with either hallucinations or actuality, realizing more precise and direct hallucination-related representations. Our analysis demonstrates that interventions along the faithful direction we identified can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory direction can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a training-free method based on SAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability across different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead.

Summary:
REVEAL is a framework designed to address issues of noisy and missing labels in popular image classification benchmark datasets like CIFAR, MNIST, and ImageNet. By integrating pre-trained vision-language models and advanced label curation methods, REVEAL detects potential label errors and omissions, aggregates predictions, and refines label accuracy through confidence-informed predictions and consensus-based filtering. The method involves human verification, significantly improving the quality of benchmark test sets and aligning closely with human judgments. The framework provides soft-labeled results with likelihoods, enabling more accurate and meaningful comparisons in image classification. A thorough analysis of state-of-the-art vision-language models and pre-trained classifiers is conducted, revealing strengths and limitations within the context of dataset renovation. This approach enhances model evaluations by revealing missing labels and improving the overall reliability of image classification tests. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image classification benchmark datasets such as CIFAR, MNIST, and ImageNet serve as critical tools for model evaluation. However, despite the cleaning efforts, these datasets still suffer from pervasive noisy labels and often contain missing labels due to the co-existing image pattern where multiple classes appear in an image sample. This results in misleading model comparisons and unfair evaluations. Existing label cleaning methods focus primarily on noisy labels, but the issue of missing labels remains largely overlooked. Motivated by these challenges, we present a comprehensive framework named REVEAL, integrating state-of-the-art pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., LLaVA, BLIP, Janus, Qwen) with advanced machine/human label curation methods (e.g., Docta, Cleanlab, MTurk), to systematically address both noisy labels and missing label detection in widely-used image classification test sets. REVEAL detects potential noisy labels and omissions, aggregates predictions from various methods, and refines label accuracy through confidence-informed predictions and consensus-based filtering. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of state-of-the-art vision-language models and pre-trained image classifiers, highlighting their strengths and limitations within the context of dataset renovation by revealing 10 observations. Our method effectively reveals missing labels from public datasets and provides soft-labeled results with likelihoods. Through human verifications, REVEAL significantly improves the quality of 6 benchmark test sets, highly aligning to human judgments and enabling more accurate and meaningful comparisons in image classification.

<div> Keywords: Reasoning LLMs, Multimodal LLMs, FRANK Model, hierarchical weight merging, multimodal reasoning benchmarks

Summary: 
The paper introduces the FRANK Model, a novel approach to enhancing Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs) with reasoning and reflection abilities without retraining or additional supervision. By decoupling perception and reasoning across MLLM decoder layers, the model combines a visual-pretrained MLLM with a reasoning-specialized LLM using a layer-wise fusion mechanism. This approach integrates reasoning capacity into deep decoder layers while maintaining visual grounding in shallow decoder layers. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the FRANK Model, with the FRANK-38B variant outperforming strong baselines and even surpassing proprietary models. The FRANK Model presents a promising training-free solution to imbue off-the-shelf MLLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities for multimodal tasks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1) have showcased impressive reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning. However, extending these capabilities to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is hampered by the prohibitive costs of retraining and the scarcity of high-quality, verifiable multimodal reasoning datasets. This paper introduces FRANK Model, a training-FRee ANd r1-liKe MLLM that imbues off-the-shelf MLLMs with reasoning and reflection abilities, without any gradient updates or extra supervision. Our key insight is to decouple perception and reasoning across MLLM decoder layers. Specifically, we observe that compared to the deeper decoder layers, the shallow decoder layers allocate more attention to visual tokens, while the deeper decoder layers concentrate on textual semantics. This observation motivates a hierarchical weight merging approach that combines a visual-pretrained MLLM with a reasoning-specialized LLM. To this end, we propose a layer-wise, Taylor-derived closed-form fusion mechanism that integrates reasoning capacity into deep decoder layers while preserving visual grounding in shallow decoder layers. Extensive experiments on challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the MMMU benchmark, our model FRANK-38B achieves an accuracy of 69.2, outperforming the strongest baseline InternVL2.5-38B by +5.3, and even surpasses the proprietary GPT-4o model.

Summary: 
The study focuses on the vulnerability of deep learning-based Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models to backdoor attacks which have not been explored previously. Existing backdoor attack methods cannot be applied to MDE models due to the unique form of labels in depth maps. The authors introduce BadDepth, the first backdoor attack specifically targeting MDE models. BadDepth selectively manipulates the depth of the target object using image segmentation and depth completion to generate poisoned datasets for object-level backdoor attacks. Additionally, digital-to-physical augmentation is developed to enhance robustness in real-world scenarios, bridging the domain gap between digital and physical environments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BadDepth in both digital and physical domains, demonstrating resilience to environmental factors. <div>

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models have been widely applied in fields such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To fill the gap in this area, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of backdoor attacks against MDE models. Typically, existing backdoor attack methods can not be applied to MDE models. This is because the label used in MDE is in the form of a depth map. To address this, we propose BadDepth, the first backdoor attack targeting MDE models. BadDepth overcomes this limitation by selectively manipulating the target object's depth using an image segmentation model and restoring the surrounding areas via depth completion, thereby generating poisoned datasets for object-level backdoor attacks. To improve robustness in physical world scenarios, we further introduce digital-to-physical augmentation to adapt to the domain gap between the physical world and the digital domain. Extensive experiments on multiple models validate the effectiveness of BadDepth in both the digital domain and the physical world, without being affected by environmental factors.

arXiv:2505.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have made remarkable progress in image restoration (IR) tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer hinders its applicability to high-resolution images. Existing methods mitigate this issue with sparse or window-based attention, yet inherently limit global context modeling. Linear attention, a variant of softmax attention, demonstrates promise in global context modeling while maintaining linear complexity, offering a potential solution to the above challenge. Despite its efficiency benefits, vanilla linear attention suffers from a significant performance drop in IR, largely due to the low-rank nature of its attention map. To counter this, we propose Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA), a simple yet effective method that enriches feature representations by integrating a lightweight depthwise convolution. Building upon RELA, we propose an efficient and effective image restoration Transformer, named LAformer. LAformer achieves effective global perception by integrating linear attention and channel attention, while also enhancing local fitting capabilities through a convolutional gated feed-forward network. Notably, LAformer eliminates hardware-inefficient operations such as softmax and window shifting, enabling efficient processing of high-resolution images. Extensive experiments across 7 IR tasks and 21 benchmarks demonstrate that LAformer outperforms SOTA methods and offers significant computational advantages.

Abstract: While most people associate LiDAR primarily with its ability to measure distances and provide geometric information about the environment (via point clouds), LiDAR also captures additional data, including reflectivity or intensity values. Unfortunately, when LiDAR is applied to Place Recognition (PR) in mobile robotics, most previous works on LiDAR-based PR rely only on geometric measurements, neglecting the additional reflectivity information that LiDAR provides. In this paper, we propose a novel descriptor for 3D PR, named RE-TRIP (REflectivity-instance augmented TRIangle descriPtor). This new descriptor leverages both geometric measurements and reflectivity to enhance robustness in challenging scenarios such as geometric degeneracy, high geometric similarity, and the presence of dynamic objects. To implement RE-TRIP in real-world applications, we further propose (1) a keypoint extraction method, (2) a key instance segmentation method, (3) a RE-TRIP matching method, and (4) a reflectivity-combined loop verification method. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of RE-TRIP. Applied to public datasets (i.e., HELIPR, FusionPortable) containing diverse scenarios such as long corridors, bridges, large-scale urban areas, and highly dynamic environments -- our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Scan Context, Intensity Scan Context, and STD.

The framework addresses challenges posed by distribution mismatches between ideal adversarial samples and natural image data. TRAIL utilizes a diffusion U-Net model to generate adversarial samples by updating its weights with a combination of adversarial objectives and perceptual constraints. This approach mitigates distribution shifts and improves cross-model attack transferability. Experimental results demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms existing methods in generating adversarial images that mislead victim models while preserving image realism. The study highlights the importance of aligning distributions for effective black-box attacks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Adversarial attacks exploiting unrestricted natural perturbations present severe security risks to deep learning systems, yet their transferability across models remains limited due to distribution mismatches between generated adversarial features and real-world data. While recent works utilize pre-trained diffusion models as adversarial priors, they still encounter challenges due to the distribution shift between the distribution of ideal adversarial samples and the natural image distribution learned by the diffusion model. To address the challenge, we propose Transferable Robust Adversarial Images via Latent Diffusion (TRAIL), a test-time adaptation framework that enables the model to generate images from a distribution of images with adversarial features and closely resembles the target images. To mitigate the distribution shift, during attacks, TRAIL updates the diffusion U-Net's weights by combining adversarial objectives (to mislead victim models) and perceptual constraints (to preserve image realism). The adapted model then generates adversarial samples through iterative noise injection and denoising guided by these objectives. Experiments demonstrate that TRAIL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-model attack transferability, validating that distribution-aligned adversarial feature synthesis is critical for practical black-box attacks.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The study investigates the effectiveness of concept erasure techniques in diffusion models. It questions whether current methods truly eliminate targeted generative concepts or merely suppress them temporarily. Two specific techniques, Unified Concept Editing and Erased Stable Diffusion, are analyzed for their robustness and reversibility. The evaluation strategy involves lightweight fine-tuning to test the reactivation potential of erased concepts. Results show that erased concepts can reemerge with high fidelity after minimal adaptation, indicating existing methods only suppress latent generative representations without completely eliminating them. The study suggests the need for representation-level interventions and more rigorous evaluation standards to ensure genuine and irreversible removal of concepts from generative models. <div>

Abstract: To what extent does concept erasure eliminate generative capacity in diffusion models? While prior evaluations have primarily focused on measuring concept suppression under specific textual prompts, we explore a complementary and fundamental question: do current concept erasure techniques genuinely remove the ability to generate targeted concepts, or do they merely achieve superficial, prompt-specific suppression? We systematically evaluate the robustness and reversibility of two representative concept erasure methods, Unified Concept Editing and Erased Stable Diffusion, by probing their ability to eliminate targeted generative behaviors in text-to-image models. These methods attempt to suppress undesired semantic concepts by modifying internal model parameters, either through targeted attention edits or model-level fine-tuning strategies. To rigorously assess whether these techniques truly erase generative capacity, we propose an instance-level evaluation strategy that employs lightweight fine-tuning to explicitly test the reactivation potential of erased concepts. Through quantitative metrics and qualitative analyses, we show that erased concepts often reemerge with substantial visual fidelity after minimal adaptation, indicating that current methods suppress latent generative representations without fully eliminating them. Our findings reveal critical limitations in existing concept erasure approaches and highlight the need for deeper, representation-level interventions and more rigorous evaluation standards to ensure genuine, irreversible removal of concepts from generative models.

arXiv:2505.16175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-video understanding has emerged as a crucial capability in real-world applications such as video surveillance, meeting summarization, educational lecture analysis, and sports broadcasting. However, it remains computationally prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video understanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three key innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that achieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals processed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method using KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an overlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference. Together, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video inputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited hardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and sampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.

<div> Keywords: image captions, Redemption Score, evaluation framework, visual semantics, language pragmatics

Summary: 
The article introduces a new evaluation framework called Redemption Score for assessing image captions. This novel approach combines three key signals to provide a more comprehensive assessment, including Mutual Information Divergence (MID) for global alignment, DINO-based perceptual similarity for visual grounding, and BERTScore for contextual text similarity against human references. The Redemption Score outperforms twelve prior methods on the Flickr8k benchmark, achieving a high Kendall-$\tau$ of 56.43 and showing strong correlation with human judgments. The framework does not require task-specific training, making it versatile and robust. The study highlights the framework's effectiveness in redeeming image semantics and linguistic interpretability, demonstrated through successful knowledge transfer in Conceptual Captions and MS COCO datasets. This approach offers a nuanced and holistic evaluation of image captions, addressing both visual and linguistic aspects effectively. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Evaluating image captions requires cohesive assessment of both visual semantics and language pragmatics, which is often not entirely captured by most metrics. We introduce Redemption Score, a novel hybrid framework that ranks image captions by triangulating three complementary signals: (1) Mutual Information Divergence (MID) for global image-text distributional alignment, (2) DINO-based perceptual similarity of cycle-generated images for visual grounding, and (3) BERTScore for contextual text similarity against human references. A calibrated fusion of these signals allows Redemption Score to offer a more holistic assessment. On the Flickr8k benchmark, Redemption Score achieves a Kendall-$\tau$ of 56.43, outperforming twelve prior methods and demonstrating superior correlation with human judgments without requiring task-specific training. Our framework provides a more robust and nuanced evaluation by effectively redeeming image semantics and linguistic interpretability indicated by strong transfer of knowledge in the Conceptual Captions and MS COCO datasets.

Summary: <br />
- Study analyzes 83k image editing requests from Reddit community (2013-2025).
- Only 33% of requests can be fulfilled by best AI editors (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit).
- AI editors perform worse on low-creativity requests compared to open-ended tasks.
- Struggles include preserving identities of people/animals and making non-requested touch-ups.

 <div>
arXiv:2505.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) holds significant promise for automating everyday image editing tasks, especially following the recent release of GPT-4o on March 25, 2025. However, what subjects do people most often want edited? What kinds of editing actions do they want to perform (e.g., removing or stylizing the subject)? Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly creative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and the corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw lessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests can currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present a unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the past 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k PSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of requests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on low-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended tasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and frequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM judges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits more than human edits.

Summary:
VLM-R^3 is a framework that enhances reasoning-based MLLMs by improving their ability to integrate visual evidence into textual reasoning. The model can dynamically decide when additional visual evidence is needed and where to focus within an image, leading to more precise grounding of textual reasoning. The core of the method is Region-Conditioned Reinforcement Policy Optimization (R-GRPO), which trains the model to select informative regions, apply appropriate transformations, and integrate visual context into reasoning steps. The model is trained on a Visuo-Lingual Interleaved Rationale (VLIR) corpus to bootstrap the policy. Experimental results on MathVista, ScienceQA, and other benchmarks demonstrate that VLM-R^3 achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot and few-shot settings, particularly excelling in questions requiring spatial reasoning or subtle visual cue extraction. <div>
arXiv:2505.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, reasoning-based MLLMs have achieved a degree of success in generating long-form textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on and revisiting of visual regions to achieve precise grounding of textual reasoning in visual evidence. We introduce \textbf{VLM-R$^3$} (\textbf{V}isual \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel with \textbf{R}egion \textbf{R}ecognition and \textbf{R}easoning), a framework that equips an MLLM with the ability to (i) decide \emph{when} additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine \emph{where} to ground within the image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved chain-of-thought. The core of our method is \textbf{Region-Conditioned Reinforcement Policy Optimization (R-GRPO)}, a training paradigm that rewards the model for selecting informative regions, formulating appropriate transformations (e.g.\ crop, zoom), and integrating the resulting visual context into subsequent reasoning steps. To bootstrap this policy, we compile a modest but carefully curated Visuo-Lingual Interleaved Rationale (VLIR) corpus that provides step-level supervision on region selection and textual justification. Extensive experiments on MathVista, ScienceQA, and other benchmarks show that VLM-R$^3$ sets a new state of the art in zero-shot and few-shot settings, with the largest gains appearing on questions demanding subtle spatial reasoning or fine-grained visual cue extraction.

Summary:
The article introduces a new model, MedCFVQA, designed to address modality preference bias in Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) systems. By training with bias and utilizing causal graphs during inference, MedCFVQA aims to overcome the imbalance between question and image modalities in MedVQA tasks. The researchers also reconstructed datasets with Changed Prior dependencies (CP) to reduce prior dependencies between questions and answers, resulting in improved model performance. Experimental results on SLAKE, RadVQA, SLAKE-CP, and RadVQA-CP datasets demonstrate the superiority of MedCFVQA over non-causal models in handling modality bias and improving accuracy in medical image analysis tasks. This approach shows promise in enhancing the efficiency of clinical diagnosis through accurate and timely responses to medical image inquiries. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of clinical diagnosis by providing accurate and timely responses to clinicians' inquiries regarding medical images. Existing MedVQA models suffered from modality preference bias, where predictions are heavily dominated by one modality while overlooking the other (in MedVQA, usually questions dominate the answer but images are overlooked), thereby failing to learn multimodal knowledge. To overcome the modality preference bias, we proposed a Medical CounterFactual VQA (MedCFVQA) model, which trains with bias and leverages causal graphs to eliminate the modality preference bias during inference. Existing MedVQA datasets exhibit substantial prior dependencies between questions and answers, which results in acceptable performance even if the model significantly suffers from the modality preference bias. To address this issue, we reconstructed new datasets by leveraging existing MedVQA datasets and Changed their P3rior dependencies (CP) between questions and their answers in the training and test set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MedCFVQA significantly outperforms its non-causal counterpart on both SLAKE, RadVQA and SLAKE-CP, RadVQA-CP datasets.

<br />Summary: This paper introduces a new Total Body Photography (TBP) system designed to automatically capture high-quality full-body images for skin cancer screening. The system utilizes depth and RGB cameras mounted on a 360-degree rotary beam, along with 3D body shape estimation and an in-focus surface optimization method to ensure optimal image resolution and sharpness. By selecting the best focus distance for each camera pose, the system can achieve an average resolution of 0.068 mm/pixel with a significant percentage of the body surface in focus. The proposed shape-aware focus method surpasses existing focus protocols such as auto-focus. The high-fidelity imaging provided by this system is expected to enhance automated skin lesion analysis and improve the effectiveness of skin cancer screening processes. <div>
arXiv:2505.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total Body Photography (TBP) is becoming a useful screening tool for patients at high risk for skin cancer. While much progress has been made, existing TBP systems can be further improved for automatic detection and analysis of suspicious skin lesions, which is in part related to the resolution and sharpness of acquired images. This paper proposes a novel shape-aware TBP system automatically capturing full-body images while optimizing image quality in terms of resolution and sharpness over the body surface. The system uses depth and RGB cameras mounted on a 360-degree rotary beam, along with 3D body shape estimation and an in-focus surface optimization method to select the optimal focus distance for each camera pose. This allows for optimizing the focused coverage over the complex 3D geometry of the human body given the calibrated camera poses. We evaluate the effectiveness of the system in capturing high-fidelity body images. The proposed system achieves an average resolution of 0.068 mm/pixel and 0.0566 mm/pixel with approximately 85% and 95% of surface area in-focus, evaluated on simulation data of diverse body shapes and poses as well as a real scan of a mannequin respectively. Furthermore, the proposed shape-aware focus method outperforms existing focus protocols (e.g. auto-focus). We believe the high-fidelity imaging enabled by the proposed system will improve automated skin lesion analysis for skin cancer screening.

- A visual question answering (VQA) system is needed to answer questions about anatomical regions on CT scans and generate reports automatically.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) scan, which produces 3D volumetric medical data that can be viewed as hundreds of cross-sectional images (a.k.a. slices), provides detailed anatomical information for diagnosis. For radiologists, creating CT radiology reports is time-consuming and error-prone. A visual question answering (VQA) system that can answer radiologists' questions about some anatomical regions on the CT scan and even automatically generate a radiology report is urgently needed. However, existing VQA systems cannot adequately handle the CT radiology question answering (CTQA) task for: (1) anatomic complexity makes CT images difficult to understand; (2) spatial relationship across hundreds slices is difficult to capture. To address these issues, this paper proposes CT-Agent, a multimodal agentic framework for CTQA. CT-Agent adopts anatomically independent tools to break down the anatomic complexity; furthermore, it efficiently captures the across-slice spatial relationship with a global-local token compression strategy. Experimental results on two 3D chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and RadGenome-ChestCT, verify the superior performance of CT-Agent.

The article introduces DOVE, an efficient one-step diffusion model for video super-resolution (VSR) that addresses the slow inference issue of multi-step models. DOVE is fine-tuned from a pretrained video diffusion model and utilizes the latent-pixel training strategy to adapt to VSR tasks gradually. A high-quality dataset tailored for VSR, named HQ-VSR, is used to further enhance DOVE's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DOVE achieves comparable or superior results to multi-step diffusion-based VSR methods while offering significantly improved inference efficiency, with up to a 28x speed-up over existing methods like MGLD-VSR. The code for DOVE is available on GitHub for reference and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2505.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated promising performance in real-world video super-resolution (VSR). However, the dozens of sampling steps they require, make inference extremely slow. Sampling acceleration techniques, particularly single-step, provide a potential solution. Nonetheless, achieving one step in VSR remains challenging, due to the high training overhead on video data and stringent fidelity demands. To tackle the above issues, we propose DOVE, an efficient one-step diffusion model for real-world VSR. DOVE is obtained by fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model (*i.e.*, CogVideoX). To effectively train DOVE, we introduce the latent-pixel training strategy. The strategy employs a two-stage scheme to gradually adapt the model to the video super-resolution task. Meanwhile, we design a video processing pipeline to construct a high-quality dataset tailored for VSR, termed HQ-VSR. Fine-tuning on this dataset further enhances the restoration capability of DOVE. Extensive experiments show that DOVE exhibits comparable or superior performance to multi-step diffusion-based VSR methods. It also offers outstanding inference efficiency, achieving up to a **28$\times$** speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/DOVE.

Abstract: This study aims to address the growing challenge of distinguishing computer-generated imagery (CGI) from authentic digital images across three different color spaces; RGB, YCbCr, and HSV. Given the limitations of existing classification methods in handling the complexity and variability of CGI, this research proposes a Swin Transformer based model for accurate differentiation between natural and synthetic images. The proposed model leverages the Swin Transformer's hierarchical architecture to capture local and global features for distinguishing CGI from natural images. Its performance was assessed through intra- and inter-dataset testing across three datasets: CiFAKE, JSSSTU, and Columbia. The model was evaluated individually on each dataset (D1, D2, D3) and on the combined datasets (D1+D2+D3) to test its robustness and domain generalization. To address dataset imbalance, data augmentation techniques were applied. Additionally, t-SNE visualization was used to demonstrate the feature separability achieved by the Swin Transformer across the selected color spaces. The model's performance was tested across all color schemes, with the RGB color scheme yielding the highest accuracy for each dataset. As a result, RGB was selected for domain generalization analysis and compared with other CNN-based models, VGG-19 and ResNet-50. The comparative results demonstrate the proposed model's effectiveness in detecting CGI, highlighting its robustness and reliability in both intra-dataset and inter-dataset evaluations. The findings of this study highlight the Swin Transformer model's potential as an advanced tool for digital image forensics, particularly in distinguishing CGI from natural images. The model's strong performance indicates its capability for domain generalization, making it a valuable asset in scenarios requiring precise and reliable image classification.

<div> learning-based compressor, multi-modal data, image, text, lightweight, compression performance <br />
Summary:<br />
DualComp is a novel learning-based lossless compressor designed to handle both image and text modalities efficiently. It addresses the challenge of modality heterogeneity by incorporating modality-unified tokenization, modality-switching contextual learning, and modality-routing mixture-of-experts into a lightweight backbone. This compressor integrates modality-specific and shared parameters for optimal parameter utilization, achieving compression performance comparable to state-of-the-art large language models for both image and text datasets. With a reparameterization training strategy, DualComp enables near real-time inference on typical desktop CPUs at a speed of 200KB/s. Despite having much fewer parameters, DualComp outperforms existing image compressors on the Kodak dataset by approximately 9% with just 1.2% of the model size. <div>
arXiv:2505.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most learning-based lossless compressors are designed for a single modality, requiring separate models for multi-modal data and lacking flexibility. However, different modalities vary significantly in format and statistical properties, making it ineffective to use compressors that lack modality-specific adaptations. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) offer a potential solution for modality-unified compression, their excessive complexity hinders practical deployment. To address these challenges, we focus on the two most common modalities, image and text, and propose DualComp, the first unified and lightweight learning-based dual-modality lossless compressor. Built on a lightweight backbone, DualComp incorporates three key structural enhancements to handle modality heterogeneity: modality-unified tokenization, modality-switching contextual learning, and modality-routing mixture-of-experts. A reparameterization training strategy is also used to boost compression performance. DualComp integrates both modality-specific and shared parameters for efficient parameter utilization, enabling near real-time inference (200KB/s) on desktop CPUs. With much fewer parameters, DualComp achieves compression performance on par with the SOTA LLM-based methods for both text and image datasets. Its simplified single-modality variant surpasses the previous best image compressor on the Kodak dataset by about 9% using just 1.2% of the model size.

Summary:
A new transformer-based method, LINEA, is introduced for line detection in digital image processing. Unlike existing transformer-based models, LINEA does not require pretraining the attention mechanism on large datasets, making it significantly faster. The method incorporates a new mechanism called Deformable Line Attention (DLA), eliminating the need for pretraining. Experimental results show that LINEA outperforms previous models on sAP in out-of-distribution dataset testing. This advancement in line detection technology allows for more accurate and efficient processing in tasks such as video analysis, where low latencies are crucial. The development of LINEA addresses the trade-off between accuracy and speed, making it a valuable tool for various applications in image processing and computer vision. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line detection is a basic digital image processing operation used by higher-level processing methods. Recently, transformer-based methods for line detection have proven to be more accurate than methods based on CNNs, at the expense of significantly lower inference speeds. As a result, video analysis methods that require low latencies cannot benefit from current transformer-based methods for line detection. In addition, current transformer-based models require pretraining attention mechanisms on large datasets (e.g., COCO or Object360). This paper develops a new transformer-based method that is significantly faster without requiring pretraining the attention mechanism on large datasets. We eliminate the need to pre-train the attention mechanism using a new mechanism, Deformable Line Attention (DLA). We use the term LINEA to refer to our new transformer-based method based on DLA. Extensive experiments show that LINEA is significantly faster and outperforms previous models on sAP in out-of-distribution dataset testing.

<div> Vision MoE, Action MoE, DriveMoE, autonomous driving, multi-view sensory data

Summary: 
DriveMoE is a novel End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) framework that incorporates a Scene-Specialized Vision Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. Building upon the Drive-$\pi_0$ framework, DriveMoE dynamically selects relevant cameras based on the driving context and activates specialized expert modules for different driving behaviors through the use of routers. This design mirrors human driving cognition by focusing on crucial visual cues and handling diverse scenarios without mode averaging. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in autonomous driving tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of combining vision and action MoE. The code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$ will be released for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) demands effective processing of multi-view sensory data and robust handling of diverse and complex driving scenarios, particularly rare maneuvers such as aggressive turns. Recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition, where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.

Summary:<br />
Training large language models (LLMs) to control graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses challenges in optimizing long-horizon action sequences with complex multimodal feedback. This study introduces Agentic Replay Policy Optimization (ARPO), an end-to-end reinforcement learning approach that enhances Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a replay buffer for reusing successful experiences. A task selection strategy filters tasks based on agent performance to focus on informative interactions, improving training stability. ARPO surpasses offline preference optimization methods, achieving competitive results on the OSWorld benchmark for GUI-based agents. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in training vision-language GUI agents for complex real-world UI interactions. The code and models are available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents for controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents a unique challenge to optimize long-horizon action sequences with multimodal feedback from complex environments. While recent works have advanced multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning and tool-using capabilities in LLMs, their application to GUI-based agents remains relatively underexplored due to the difficulty of sparse rewards, delayed feedback, and high rollout costs. In this paper, we investigate end-to-end policy optimization for vision-language-based GUI agents with the aim of improving performance on complex, long-horizon computer tasks. We propose Agentic Replay Policy Optimization (ARPO), an end-to-end RL approach that augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a replay buffer to reuse the successful experience across training iterations. To further stabilize the training process, we propose a task selection strategy that filters tasks based on baseline agent performance, allowing the agent to focus on learning from informative interactions. Additionally, we compare ARPO with offline preference optimization approaches, highlighting the advantages of policy-based methods in GUI environments. Experiments on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that ARPO achieves competitive results, establishing a new performance baseline for LLM-based GUI agents trained via reinforcement learning. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for training multi-turn, vision-language GUI agents capable of managing complex real-world UI interactions.

Abstract: Recently, prototype learning has emerged in semi-supervised medical image segmentation and achieved remarkable performance. However, the scarcity of labeled data limits the expressiveness of prototypes in previous methods, potentially hindering the complete representation of prototypes for class embedding. To overcome this issue, we propose an efficient prototype consistency learning via joint uncertainty quantification and data augmentation (EPCL-JUDA) to enhance the semantic expression of prototypes based on the framework of Mean-Teacher. The concatenation of original and augmented labeled data is fed into student network to generate expressive prototypes. Then, a joint uncertainty quantification method is devised to optimize pseudo-labels and generate reliable prototypes for original and augmented unlabeled data separately. High-quality global prototypes for each class are formed by fusing labeled and unlabeled prototypes, which are utilized to generate prototype-to-features to conduct consistency learning. Notably, a prototype network is proposed to reduce high memory requirements brought by the introduction of augmented data. Extensive experiments on Left Atrium, Pancreas-NIH, Type B Aortic Dissection datasets demonstrate EPCL-JUDA's superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be released soon.

<div> Keywords: weakly supervised object detection, multi-class classification, classification enhancement module, self-classification correction algorithm, VOC dataset 

Summary:
In the realm of weakly supervised object detection (WSOD), a novel framework has been introduced to address classification ambiguities and leverage the strengths of multi-class classification tasks. This framework incorporates an intra-class binary classification (ICBC) task to enhance the network's discrimination between positive and mis-located samples, bridging the gap between different MCC tasks. Additionally, a self-classification correction algorithm is proposed during inference to improve the accuracy of predictions by combining the results of both MCC tasks. Experimental results on the VOC 2007 & 2012 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of this framework compared to existing methods. The framework's self-classification enhancement module and self-classification correction algorithm work hand in hand to refine object detection results and overcome challenges in weakly supervised learning settings. This innovative approach showcases the potential for further advancements in WSOD research and applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted much attention due to its low labeling cost. The success of recent WSOD models is often ascribed to the two-stage multi-class classification (MCC) task, i.e., multiple instance learning and online classification refinement. Despite achieving non-trivial progresses, these methods overlook potential classification ambiguities between these two MCC tasks and fail to leverage their unique strengths. In this work, we introduce a novel WSOD framework to ameliorate these two issues. For one thing, we propose a self-classification enhancement module that integrates intra-class binary classification (ICBC) to bridge the gap between the two distinct MCC tasks. The ICBC task enhances the network's discrimination between positive and mis-located samples in a class-wise manner and forges a mutually reinforcing relationship with the MCC task. For another, we propose a self-classification correction algorithm during inference, which combines the results of both MCC tasks to effectively reduce the mis-classified predictions. Extensive experiments on the prevalent VOC 2007 & 2012 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces SAMba-UNet, a novel dual-encoder architecture for automated cardiac MRI segmentation. By combining SAM2, Mamba, and UNet, the model enables cross-modal feature collaborative learning. A Dynamic Feature Fusion Refiner is incorporated to enhance small lesion feature extraction through multi-scale pooling and dual-path calibration.

Abstract: To address the challenge of complex pathological feature extraction in automated cardiac MRI segmentation, this study proposes an innovative dual-encoder architecture named SAMba-UNet. The framework achieves cross-modal feature collaborative learning by integrating the vision foundation model SAM2, the state-space model Mamba, and the classical UNet. To mitigate domain discrepancies between medical and natural images, a Dynamic Feature Fusion Refiner is designed, which enhances small lesion feature extraction through multi-scale pooling and a dual-path calibration mechanism across channel and spatial dimensions. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Omni-Attention Convergence Module (HOACM) is introduced, combining global contextual attention with branch-selective emphasis mechanisms to effectively fuse SAM2's local positional semantics and Mamba's long-range dependency modeling capabilities. Experiments on the ACDC cardiac MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.9103 and an HD95 boundary error of 1.0859 mm, significantly outperforming existing methods, particularly in boundary localization for complex pathological structures such as right ventricular anomalies. This work provides an efficient and reliable solution for automated cardiac disease diagnosis, and the code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Image to image translation is an active area of research in the field of computer vision, enabling the generation of new images with different styles, textures, or resolutions while preserving their characteristic properties. Recent architectures leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to transform input images from one domain to another. In this work, we focus on the study of both paired and unpaired image translation across multiple image domains. For the paired task, we used a conditional GAN model, and for the unpaired task, we trained it using cycle consistency loss. We experimented with different types of loss functions, multiple Patch-GAN sizes, and model architectures. New quantitative metrics - precision, recall, and FID score - were used for analysis. In addition, a qualitative study of the results of different experiments was conducted.

<div> adversarial examples, deep neural networks, image classification, targeted attacks, edge information <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel attack method called Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA) for generating adversarial examples in image classification tasks. TEA leverages edge information from the target image to craft perturbations that result in an adversarial image closer to the source image while still achieving the desired target classification. This approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by requiring nearly 70% fewer queries in low query settings, making it more practical for real-world applications with limited access. TEA also provides an improved target initialization for existing geometry-based attacks, enhancing the overall effectiveness of attack strategies in black-box settings. <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions. Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly 70\% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.

Abstract: This paper reports on the NTIRE 2025 challenge on Text to Image (T2I) generation model quality assessment, which will be held in conjunction with the New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement Workshop (NTIRE) at CVPR 2025. The aim of this challenge is to address the fine-grained quality assessment of text-to-image generation models. This challenge evaluates text-to-image models from two aspects: image-text alignment and image structural distortion detection, and is divided into the alignment track and the structural track. The alignment track uses the EvalMuse-40K, which contains around 40K AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) generated by 20 popular generative models. The alignment track has a total of 371 registered participants. A total of 1,883 submissions are received in the development phase, and 507 submissions are received in the test phase. Finally, 12 participating teams submitted their models and fact sheets. The structure track uses the EvalMuse-Structure, which contains 10,000 AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) with corresponding structural distortion mask. A total of 211 participants have registered in the structure track. A total of 1155 submissions are received in the development phase, and 487 submissions are received in the test phase. Finally, 8 participating teams submitted their models and fact sheets. Almost all methods have achieved better results than baseline methods, and the winning methods in both tracks have demonstrated superior prediction performance on T2I model quality assessment.
